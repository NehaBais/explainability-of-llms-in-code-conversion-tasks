# Create a string variable equal to any text value
s = "hello"

# Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal
s2 = s + " literal"

# To illustrate the operation, show the content of the variables
print(s)
print(s2)

# Since there's no need for dynamic memory allocation in Python,
# we don't have a direct equivalent to the `free` function.
