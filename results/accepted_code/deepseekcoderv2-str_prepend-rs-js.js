var s = "World";
s = `Hello ${s}`;
console.log(`${s}`);

//The Rust code is essentially creating a string variable named s and initializing it with the value "World". It then uses the to_string() method of String to convert this into a String type, which allows us to use methods on the String like insert_str(). The insert_str() method inserts another string at a specified index in the string. In this case, we're inserting the text "Hello " at index 0 (the beginning) of the string s.
//The Rust code then uses println! macro to print out the value of the variable s using placeholders and interpolation syntax ${}. This is equivalent to console.log() function in JavaScript with template literals ${} for interpolation. The output will be "Hello World".
