#include <iostream> // standard input output library from C++11 onwards, or iostream.h if using older version of GCC 4.* and above

                     // statement (it will work without this because most
                     // compilers automatically add it), also note that there is
                     // no semicolon after the word "namespace" unlike with
                     // variables which are terminated by semi-colons at end -
                     // so if your code had something like "return 0;" then you
                     // would need to use braces around all statements inside

             // separate declaration statement for each line (and thus require
             // semicolons) here we only need one semicolon per line so it won't
             // cause any problems when compiling
  return 0;  // return value of function (can also be done without braces but if
             // you want to make sure that everything works correctly then use
             // braces around the whole thing including its body code).
