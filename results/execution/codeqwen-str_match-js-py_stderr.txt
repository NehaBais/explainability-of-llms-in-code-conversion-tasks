This returns the bitwise inversion of the underlying int object and is usually not what you expect from negating a bool. Use the 'not' operator for boolean negation or ~int(x) if you really want the bitwise inversion of the underlying int.
  stringB, stringA, "Yes, at index {}".format(q2) if ~q2 else "No."
