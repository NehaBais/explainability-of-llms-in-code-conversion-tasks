The error is caused by unexpected parentheses at the end of statements, which results in syntax errors.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the extra parentheses around variable declarations.

Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main

import (
		"fmt"
)

func main() {
		// Get two integers from the user.
		var a int = 5 // Insert your desired input value for 'a'
						var b int = 3 // Insert your desired input value for 'b'

						// Calculate the results.
						sum := a + b
						difference := a - b
						product := a * b
						divisionResult := a / b // This performs integer division
						remainder := a % b // This produces the remainder after dividing 'b' into 'a'. The '%' operator is called the 'modulo' operator

						// Display the results.
						fmt.Printf("a + b = %d\n", sum))
						fmt.Printf("a - b = %d\n", difference))
						fmt.Printf("a * b = %d\n", product))
						fmt.Printf("a / b = %d\n", divisionResult))
						fmt.Printf("a %% b = %d\n", remainder))
}
```
The entire code has been rewritten in a single fenced code block, ensuring that the solution is clear and concise.
