Error: The `replace()` method is used to replace all occurrences of the specified character sequence in the original string with the specified value. However, since Java 15, the `replace()` method now returns a new string that does not change the original string. This behavior is called " immutable" or " non-mutating". To fix this error, you can either modify the original string to use the `replace()` method in place (which would mutate the original string), or create a new string using the `replace()` method and return it from your method.
```java
String original = "Mary had a X lamb";
String little = "little";
original = original.replace("X", little); //mutates the original string
```
