The error message indicates that there are syntax errors in the C++ code which is not allowed by the compiler. This can be attributed to issues with indentation, the use of special characters or invalid identifiers. 

The fix for this issue would be simple - remove those special/unwanted characters. In your case, it seems like you've accidentally added some weird unicode symbols in your return statement which is causing the error. 

Here is the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   // Get two integers from the user
   int input1 = 18;
   int input2 = 7;

   // Calculate and print their sum
   cout << "Sum:               " << (input1 + input2) << endl;

   // Calculate and print difference
   cout << "Difference:         " << (input1 - input2) << endl;

   // Calculate and print product
   cout << "Product:            " << (input1 * input2) << endl;

   // Calculate integer quotient. Here, for simplicity we assume that the inputs
   // are non-zero to avoid divide by zero error. In a real application you would
   // need to handle these scenarios properly.
   cout << "Integer Division:   " << (input1 / input2) << endl;

   // For remainder calculation, I've considered that the inputs are non-zero. 
   // In a real application you need to handle these scenarios properly by checking for zero division error.
   int remainder = input1 % input2;
   cout << "Remainder:          " << remainder << endl;

   // For exponentiation, I've considered that the inputs are non-zero and positive. 
   // In real scenarios you would need to handle these cases properly by checking for overflow or underflow issues.
   int yy = pow(input1, input2);
   cout << "Exponentiation:     " << yy << endl;

   return 0;  // program returns 0 if successful run
}
```
You might want to check that the inputs are non-zero and positive in your real application. This code is a simple demonstration of basic arithmetic operations with integers in C++. If you need more advanced features, such as error handling or input from the user, this code will not cover those topics.
