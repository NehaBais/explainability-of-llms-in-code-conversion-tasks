The error message indicates that there are some unrecognized characters used in a return statement, which is not allowed in C++. The "<|>" syntax you're using seems to be from a markdown-like language, but it does not have an equivalent in standard C++ or Python. 

The fix would be to remove the "<|>", as they are unnecessary and cause errors:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   // Create a string variable equal to any text value
  string s1 = "hello";

   // Concatenate with another string literal
  cout << s1 + " world" << endl;

  s1 += " world";
  cout << s1 << endl;

   // Join strings using stringstream
  stringstream ss;
  ss << s1 << ", " << "world" << ", " << "mom";

   // And print the resultant string
  cout << ss.str() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
