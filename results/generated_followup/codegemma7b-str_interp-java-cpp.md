**Error:** The code uses the `std` namespace without including the necessary header file `<string>`.

**Fix:** Add the `<string>` header file to include the necessary string functions.

**Corrected Code:**

```cpp
#include <string>

std::string adjective = "little";
std::string lyric = std::string("Mary had a ") + adjective + " lamb";
```
