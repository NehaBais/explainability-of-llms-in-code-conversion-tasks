Error: Implicitly declared classes are a preview feature and are disabled by default, so we need to enable them using the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling.
Fix: Add the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling the code.
Corrected code:
```java
void print_logic(boolean a, boolean b) {
	System.out.println("a and b is " + (a && b));
	System.out.println("a or b is " + (a || b));
	System.out.println("not a is " + !a);
}
```
