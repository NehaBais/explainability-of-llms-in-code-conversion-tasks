The error is generated due to multiple issues:
1. An overloaded function could not be resolved. This likely means that there are multiple functions with the same name, but they have different parameters or return types.
2. The compiler couldn't guess which overloaded function you wanted to call. It's possible that the compiler got confused by the syntax of your code.
3. A simple typo might have caused the error. For example, if you meant to use `__builtin_bitnot` instead of `'__builtin_rint'`, then the error would be resolved easily.

The fix is to replace `'__builtin_rint'` with `__builtin_bitnot(a))`. This will ensure that the correct bitwise NOT operation is performed on the integer value stored in variable 'a'.

Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void bitwise(int a, int b) 
{
  cout << "a and b: " << a & b << endl;
  cout << "a or b: " << a | b << endl;
  cout << "a xor b: " << a ^ b << endl;
  // Perform bitwise shift on the first integer with a shift/rotate amount of the second integer.
  unsigned int c = a;
  cout << "c >> b: " << (c >> b) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
