The error message indicates that there are multiple issues with the code. The missing filename for the includes, the use of undeclared identifiers such as `cout`, `endl`, `string`, and `size_t`, and the use of an undefined variable `pos` in the while loop condition and in the cout statement all indicate a problem with the code.
The fix is to provide the correct filename for the includes and to declare the missing variables and identifiers such as `cout`, `endl`, `string`, and `size_t`. In addition, the declaration of the variable `pos` should be moved outside of the while loop condition to avoid undefined behavior.
Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include
#include
using namespace std;
int main() {
 string str1 = "abcd";
 string str2 = "ab";
 bool startsWith = (str1.substr(0, str2.length()) == str2);
 cout << "Determining if the first string starts with second string: "
      << startsWith << endl;
 bool contains = false;
 size_t pos = 0;
 while ((pos = str1.find(str2, pos)) != string::npos) {
  cout << "Match found at position: " << pos << endl;
  pos++; // Avoid finding overlapping matches
 }
 cout << "Determining if the first string contains the second string at any "
      << contains << endl;
 bool endsWith = (str1.substr(str1.length() - str2.length()) == str2);
 cout << "Determining if the first string ends with the second string: "
      << endsWith << endl;
 return 0;
}
```
