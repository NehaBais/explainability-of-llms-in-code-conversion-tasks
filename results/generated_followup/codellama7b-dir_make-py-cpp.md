The errors occur because the `fs` namespace is not declared before being used. To fix this, we need to add the necessary declarations at the top of the code. Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

void mkdirp(const std::string &path) {
  if (fs::exists(path)) {
    return;
  }

  // Create missing parents if needed
  fs::create_directories(path);
}
```
The corrected code includes the necessary declarations for the `fs` namespace at the top of the file, and removes any errors that occurred due to the `fs` namespace not being declared before being used.
