Error: The Java compiler is not enabled to compile code with implicitly declared classes, which is the case for this function.
Fix: To fix this error, you need to enable the preview feature in the Java compiler by adding the `--enable-preview` option when compiling the code.
Corrected code:
```java
public static void logic(boolean a, boolean b) {
    System.out.println("a AND b: " + (a && b));
    System.out.println("a OR b: " + (a || b));
    System.out.println("NOT a: " + (!a));
}
```
