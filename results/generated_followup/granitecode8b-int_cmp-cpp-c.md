The error in the code is that it does not include the necessary header files for `printf`, `scanf`, and `fprintf`. The fix is to add the appropriate header files at the beginning of the program. The corrected code is as follows:
```c
#include 
int main() {
 int a, b;
 
 printf("Enter two integers: ");
 if (scanf("%d %d", &a, &b) != 2) {
 fprintf(stderr, "Could not read the numbers.n");
 return 1;
 }
 
 // test for less-than
 if (a < b) {
 printf("%d is less than %dn", a, b);
 }
 
 // test for equality
 if (a == b) {
 printf("%d is equal to %dn", a, b);
 }
 
 // test for greater-than
 if (a > b) {
 printf("%d is greater than %dn", a, b);
 }
 
 return 0;
}
```
