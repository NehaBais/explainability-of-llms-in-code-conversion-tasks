The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the `boost/filesystem.hpp` file, which is a header required for Boost's filesystem library. The fix to this problem would be to either install or correctly point out where the boost headers are located.

If you have installed Boost in a non-standard location, you may need to set BOOST_ROOT environment variable to its installation directory path. For example, if the boost is installed at `/opt/boost` then you can do: `export BOOST_ROOT=/opt/boost`.

Or on Windows, add the Boost include directory in Additional Include Directories while building your project.

The corrected code would be as follows:
```c
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = boost::filesystem;

void create_directory(std::string path) 
{
    fs::path dir(path);
    if (!fs::exists(dir)) // If the directory does not exist already, it will be created.
        fs::create_directories(dir);
}

int main() 
{
    try 
    {
        create_directory("C:/parent/test");
        std::cout << "path successfully created" << std::endl;
    } 
    catch (const boost::filesystem::filesystem_error& ex) 
    {
        std::cout << ex.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
