The error is due to missing semicolons at the end of lines involving method calls, such as `System.out.println()`. 

The fix involves adding semicolons at the end of each line where a method call ends with a closing parenthesis `)`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CompareIntegers 
{

    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in));
        System.out.println("Enter first integer:");
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter second integer:");
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        compare(a, b);
    }

    public static void compare(int a, int b) 
    {
        if (a == b) 
        {
            System.out.println(a + " equals " + b));
        } 
        else if (a < b) 
        {
            System.out.println(a + " is less than " + b));
        } 
        else if (a > b) 
        {
            System.out.println(a + " is greater than " + b));
        } 
        else 
        {
            System.out.println("Invalid comparison: '" + a + "' and '" + b + "' are not of the same type and cannot be compared.");
        }
    }
}
```
This Java code fixes the errors in the original JavaScript function by adding semicolons at the end of lines involving method calls.
