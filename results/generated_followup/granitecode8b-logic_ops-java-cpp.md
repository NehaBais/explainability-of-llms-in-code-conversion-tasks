The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the `std` namespace, which is part of the C++ Standard Library. To fix this, you need to include the necessary header file at the beginning of the file. The fix is to add `#include  in front of the function definition line. Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
void logic(bool a, bool b) {
 std::cout << "a AND b: " << (a && b) << std::endl;
 std::cout << "a OR b: " << (a || b) << std::endl;
 std::cout << "NOT a: " << (!a) << std::endl;
}
``` 
Note that the `using namespace std;` statement is not recommended in C++ as it can cause name conflicts and make the code harder to read.
