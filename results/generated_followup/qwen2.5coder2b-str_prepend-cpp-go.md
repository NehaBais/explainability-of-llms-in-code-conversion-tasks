The error `undefined: strings` occurs because Go does not have a direct equivalent to C++'s `<vector>` or `<algorithm>` libraries, as well as string manipulation functions like `std::accumulate`. To fix this issue, you would need to use the built-in string package in Go, which includes functions like `strings.Join`.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	myStrings := []string{"prepended to", "my string"}
	prepended := strings.Join(myStrings, "")
	fmt.Println(prepended)
}
```

This will correctly concatenate all elements of `myStrings` into a single string and print it.
