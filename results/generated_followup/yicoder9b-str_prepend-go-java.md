The error message is indicating that implicitly declared classes are a preview feature (these were introduced in Java 12), which means they aren't fully supported yet by all compilers. They have to be explicitly enabled using the --enable-preview flag when compiling your code.

The correct code would be:
```java
String s = "world!";
s = "Hello, " + s;
```
