 The error is caused by Rust's requirement that all compiled programs should have a `main` function, but the provided code does not have such a function. Therefore, Rust cannot compile this code as it lacks the entry point of the program. 

To fix this problem, you can simply add a `main` function to your code:

```rs
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Your directory creation logic goes here
}

fn mkdirp(path: &str) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
    fs::create_dir_all(path)
}
```
In this corrected code, a `main` function is added at the top level of the file. The `mkdirp` function can still be called from within `main`, but it does not need to be called directly in order for the program to start running.
