The error message indicates that `std::filesystem` is not available which makes sense as it's an experimental feature introduced from C++17. The fix is to use Boost library instead, because it provides a compatibility layer for the filesystem APIs between both Unix/Linux systems and Windows. 

Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>
namespace fs = boost::filesystem;

int main() {
    fs::ofstream outfile1("output.txt"); // opens file in current directory
    if(outfile1) {
        outfile1.close();  // close the file as we don'<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜> need to write anything here, just create an empty file
   }

   fs::create_directory("docs"); // creates a "docs" folder in current directory
}
```
Please note you must install Boost library and include it while compiling the program. 
- Use `#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>` for including the Boost Filesystem.
- And `namespace fs = boost::filesystem;` to use its functionalities in your code more easily.
