 The error is caused by trying to modify string literals (i.e., const char*), which are generally read-only in C. Trying to assign values directly to them will result in an error, as they are typically stored in the text segment of the executable and cannot be changed at runtime. 

To fix this issue, we need to create a mutable copy of string literals and then perform operations on that copy. This can be achieved using strdup() function which returns a dynamically allocated duplicate of the string pointed by string. The original string remains unchanged.

Here is the corrected code:

```c
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

void demo_compare(const char *a, const char *b) {
  char* a_copy = strdup(a);
  char* b_copy = strdup(b);
  
  printf("%s and %s are ", a_copy, b_copy);
  if (strcmp(a_copy, b_copy) == 0) {
    printf("exactly lexically equal.\n");
  } else {
    printf("not exactly lexically equal.\n");
  }
  
  printf("%s and %s are ", a_copy, b_copy);
  if (strcmp(a_copy, b_copy) != 0) {
    printf("lexically inequal.\n");
  } else {
    printf("lexically equal.\n");
  }
  
  printf("%s is ", a_copy);
  if (strcmp(a_copy, b_copy) < 0) {
    printf("lexically ordered before %s.\n", b_copy);
  } else {
    printf("not lexically ordered before %s.\n", b_copy);
  }
  
  printf("%s is ", a_copy);
  if (strcmp(a_copy, b_copy) > 0) {
    printf("lexically ordered after %s.\n", b_copy);
  } else {
    printf("not lexically ordered after %s.\n", b_copy);
  }
  
  free(a_copy); // Don't forget to free the dynamic memory
  free(b_copy);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  const char* a = (argc > 1) ? argv[1] : "1.2.Foo";
  const char* b = (argc > 2) ? argv[2] : "1.3.Bar";
  
  demo_compare(a, b);
  
  double numA = atof(argv[1]);
  double numB = atof(argv[2]);
  demo_compare(numA, numB);
  
  if (strcmp(a, b) == 0) {
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
  } else {
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }
}
```
