The error was due to missing header files for standard input/output (`stdio.h`) and the `printf` function, as well as incorrect usage of the `&&`, `||`, and `!` operators in C. The fix involved adding the necessary header files and correcting the operator usage.
Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include 
#include 
void printLogic(int a, int b) {
 printf("a and b is %d
", a && b);
 printf("a or b is %d
", a || b);
 printf("not a is %d
", !a);
}
int main() {
 printLogic(1, 1); // Example usage
 return 0;
}
```
