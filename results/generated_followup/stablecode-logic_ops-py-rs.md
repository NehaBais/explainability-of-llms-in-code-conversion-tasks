Error: `main` function not found in crate `stablecode_logic_ops_py_rs`.
Fix: Add a `main` function to the Rust code. The `main` function serves as an entry point for the program execution. Here's an example of how you can modify the provided Rust code to include a `main` function:
```rust
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a || b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);
}

fn main() {
    logic(true, false);
}
```
In this modified code, we added the `main` function at the end of the code. The `main` function calls the `logic` function with boolean arguments `true` and `false`.
The entire Rust code for your Python logic function is now written in a single fenced code block above.
