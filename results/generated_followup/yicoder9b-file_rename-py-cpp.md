The errors are due to incorrect usage of the rename function, which is supposed to be used for renaming files or directories within a filesystem but not at the filesystem root level. The rename function takes two parameters - the current name and the new name of the file/directory - both should be path-names. 

The corrected code would look like this:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
   if (rename("input.txt", "output.txt") == 0) {
     printf("File renamed successfully!\n");
   } else {
     printf("Unable to rename the file!\n");
   }  
   
   if (rename("docs", "mydocs") == 0) {
     printf("Directory renamed successfully!\n");
   } else {
     printf("Unable to rename the directory!\n");
   }
   
   return 0;
}
```
