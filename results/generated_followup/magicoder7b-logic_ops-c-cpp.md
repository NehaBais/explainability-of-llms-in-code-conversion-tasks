 The error occurs because the linker can't find the `main` symbol, which is required for any C or C++ program to execute. It's like having a driver's license but no car to drive. This issue arises when compiling without a `main` function (the entry point of any application).

The fix would be to add a `main` function in the code, which is usually the starting point for any program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void print_logic(int a, int b) {
  cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << endl;
  cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << endl;
  cout << "not a is " << (!a) << endl;
}

int main() {
    print_logic(true, false); // example usage of the function. You can call it with any parameters as per your requirements.
    return 0;
}
```

In this C++ code, `main` is the entry point of the application where execution begins and ends. The `print_logic` function is called within the main function to execute its logic.
