This error indicates that there is an unknown type name 'package' in Golang. This is not a syntax issue but a problem with Go language version compatibility. The line `package main import "os"` is using the current Go version and it has a different 'package' keyword than expected. The 'package main' should be compatible with the current Go version.

The fixed code can be as follows:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
  return 0;
}
```
This will print "Hello, world!" to the console and return zero. This should compile with no warnings or errors.
