The error occurs because `new File("input.txt").renameTo(new File("output.txt"))` is attempting to create a file named "output.txt" if it does not already exist, but it's being attempted on the current directory instead of the expected filesystem root for the operation. The same problem exists with `new File("docs").renameTo(new File("mydocs"))` as well.

The Java code should look like this:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Rename file "input.txt" to "output.txt" in current directory and filesystem root
        File src = new File("input.txt");
        if (src.renameTo(new File("output.txt"))) {
            System.out.println("File renamed successfully from input.txt to output.txt");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to rename file from input.txt to output.txt");
        }

        // Rename directory "docs" to "mydocs" in current directory and filesystem root
        File srcRoot = new File("docs");
        if (srcRoot.renameTo(new File("mydocs"))) {
            System.out.println("Directory renamed successfully from docs to mydocs");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to rename directory from docs to mydocs");
        }
    }
}
```
