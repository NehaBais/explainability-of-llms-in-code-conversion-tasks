Error: 
The error is that the code is not being compiled or executed properly because of some syntax errors, undefined variables, or warnings. The first error is with the `#include` directive, which specifies a file to include in the program. The second error is with the `using namespace std;` statement, which uses the entire `std` namespace and conflicts with the local `std` namespace defined in the code. The third error is with the function signature, which specifies an integer as input and returns a vector of integers. The fourth error is with the variable declaration, which tries to declare a vector but does not define it. The fifth error is with the function call, which tries to call the `factors` function without defining it. The sixth error is with the output statements, which try to use variables that are undefined or have not been declared. The seventh error is with the declaration of a local variable, which is not in scope for the rest of the program.
Fix: 
To fix these errors, you can follow these steps:
1. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement since it conflicts with the local `std` namespace defined in the code.
2. Add the `iostream` header file to include the `cout` and `endl` functions for outputting data.
3. Change the function signature from `vector factors(int num)` to `vector factors(const int& num)`. This ensures that only positive integers are accepted as input.
4. Declare a local variable `vector n_factors` within the function scope instead of outside it.
5. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement since it conflicts with the local `std` namespace defined in the code.
6. Add the `sqrt` function from the `<cmath>` header file to calculate the square root of a number.
7. Change the function call to `factors(num)` instead of `factors(const int& num)`. This ensures that only positive integers are accepted as input.
8. Remove the `using namespace std;` statement since it conflicts with the local `std` namespace defined in the code.
9. Add the `cout` and `endl` functions from the `<iostream>` header file to output data to the console.
10. Change the output statements to `cout << factors[i] << " ";` instead of `cout << factors[i] << endl;`. This ensures that each element in the vector is outputted on a new line.
Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
 
std::vector<int> factors(const int& num) {
    std::vector<int> n_factors;
    for (int i = 1; i <= num / 2; ++i) {
        if (num % i == 0) {
            n_factors.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return n_factors;
}
 
int main() {
    int num;
    std::cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
    std::cin >> num;
    const auto factors = factors(num);
    for (const auto& factor : factors) {
        std::cout << factor << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
The error messages indicate that the code is not being compiled or executed properly because of some syntax errors, undefined variables, or warnings. To fix these errors, you need to make changes to the code and remove any conflicts between the local `std` namespace and the global `std` namespace. The changes include removing the unnecessary `#include` directive, using the correct function signature, declaring a local variable within the function scope, removing the unnecessary `using namespace std;` statement, adding the required header files for outputting data, and changing the output statements to output the elements of the vector on separate lines.
