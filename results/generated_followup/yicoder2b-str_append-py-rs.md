The error indicates that we cannot use the `+=` operator (which would concatenate two strings) on a variable of type `str` in Rust. Instead, you need to assign the result of the string concatenation operation back to the original variable (`*str`). Here's the correct version:
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut str = "12345678";
    *str = &str + "9!";  // Using str slice syntax here
    println!("{}", str); // This will print: 123456789!
}
```
This code creates a mutable string and appends the string "9!" to it. The result is that `str` now contains the value "123456789!".
