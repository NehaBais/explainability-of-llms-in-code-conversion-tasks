The error occurs because the C program does not have a `main` function, which is required for any executable code in C. The compiler expects an entry point to begin execution, but it cannot find this main function in the provided code.

To fix the error, you need to add a main function that calls your bitwise function with appropriate arguments. Here's how you can do that:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void bitwise(int a, int b) {
  printf("a and b: %d\n", a & b);
  printf("a or b:  %d\n", a | b);
  printf("a xor b: %d\n", a ^ b);
  printf("not a:   %u\n", ~a);

  // Note: the C/C++ shift operators are not guaranteed to work if the shift
  // count (that is, b) is negative, or is greater or equal to the number of
  // bits in the integer being shifted.
  printf("a shl b: %d\n", a << b);
  printf("a shr b: %d\n", a >> b);

  unsigned int ua = a;
  printf("a lsr b: %u\n", ua >> b);

  // Implementing left and right rotation manually as C does not have built-in
  // support for that
  int mask =
      sizeof(int) * 8 -
      1; // to ensure the shift count is within the limit of the integer size
  b &= mask;
  printf("a rol b: %u\n", (ua << b) | (ua >> (sizeof(int) * 8 - b)));
  printf("a ror b: %u\n", (ua >> b) | (ua << (sizeof(int) * 8 - b)));
}

int main() {
    bitwise(123, 4);
    return 0;
}
```
