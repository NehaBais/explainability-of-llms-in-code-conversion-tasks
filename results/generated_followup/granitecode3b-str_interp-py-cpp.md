Error: The C++ compiler is unable to find the `iostream` header file, which contains the `cout` and `endl` functions used to print output to the console. To fix this error, we need to include the `iostream` header file at the beginning of our C++ code using the `#include` directive.
Fix: Add the following line of code at the top of our C++ code to include the `iostream` header file.
Rewritten code block:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
  string extra = "little";
  string new_str = "Mary had a " + extra + " lamb.";
  cout << new_str << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
