The error occurs because of an unexpected token `)`. The realloc() function is used to change the size of the memory allocation for fctrs.list[]. However, it seems that there's a missing closing parenthesis in this line.

Here's the corrected code in a single code block:

```javascript
class Factors 
{
    constructor() 
    {
        this.list = [];
        this.count = 0;
    }

    factorize(num) 
    {
        const fctrs  = new Factors();
        for (let dvsr = 1; dvsr * dvsr <= num; dvsr++) 
        {
            if ((num % dvsr) == 0) 
            {
                fctrs.list[fctrs.count] = dvsr;
                fctrs.count++;
            }
        }
        return fctrs;
    }
}
```
