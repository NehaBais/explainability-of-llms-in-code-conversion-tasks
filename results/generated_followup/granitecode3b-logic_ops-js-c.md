Error: The C compiler is complaining that it cannot find the `printf` function, which is used to print out the results of logical operations. This is because C does not have a built-in library function for printing strings, so we need to include the `stdio.h` header and explicitly declare the `printf` function.
Rewritten Code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
void logic(int a, int b) {
  printf("a AND b: %d", a && b);
  printf("n");
  printf("a OR b: %d", a || b);
  printf("n");
  printf("NOT a: %d", !a);
  printf("n");
}
int main() {
 logic(1, 1);
 return 0;
}
```
In this corrected code, we added the necessary header and function declaration for `printf`, and then called the `logic` function with some sample input values (in this case, 1 and 1).
