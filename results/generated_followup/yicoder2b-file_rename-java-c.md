Sure, let's convert this Java code to C first. Here's how it would look:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
  char oldname[100] = "input.txt";
  char newname[100] = "output.txt";
  if (rename(oldname, newname) == 0) {
    printf("The file called %s was renamed as %s\n", oldname, newname);
  } else {
    printf("Could not rename the file %s\n", oldname);
  }

  char dirname[100] = "docs";
  char mydirname[100] = "mydocs";
  if (rename(dirname, mydirname) == 0) {
    printf("The directory %s was renamed as %s\n", dirname, mydirname);
  } else {
    printf("Could not rename the directory %s\n", dirname);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code will print whether it has been able to successfully rename a file or directory. Note that this is an example of how to use C functions with basic error handling. If you are working with more complex operations involving file systems and large amounts of data, you would need to handle these errors explicitly in your program. This is also a very minimal example, but it should give you a decent starting point.
