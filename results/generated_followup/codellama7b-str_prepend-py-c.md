Error: The `strcpy` function takes two arguments of type `char *`, but the operands `s` and `"0" + s` have incompatible types, with `s` being a `char[9]` array and `"0" + s` being a string literal.

Fix: Change the type of `s` to `char *`, so that it can be used as an argument for `strcpy`.

Corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char s[9] = "12345678";
  char *str = "0" + s; // by concatenation
  printf("%s\n", str);
  return 0;
}
```
