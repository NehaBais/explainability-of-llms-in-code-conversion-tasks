Error: The error message indicates that implicitly declared classes are disabled by default in Java, so the code needs to be compiled with the `--enable-preview` flag.

Fix: To fix this issue, you need to add the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling the code. You can do this by running the following command: `javac --enable-preview None.java`. This will enable the implicit declaration of classes and allow the code to compile successfully.

Corrected Code:
```java
public static void printLogic(boolean a, boolean b) {
    System.out.println("a and b is " + (a && b));
    System.out.println("a or b is " + (a || b));
    System.out.println("not a is " + (!a));
}
```
