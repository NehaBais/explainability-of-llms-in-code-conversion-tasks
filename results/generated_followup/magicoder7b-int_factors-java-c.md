 The error message indicates that the function `sqrt` is not declared or included in the C program, which is a requirement for its use but it isn't included with standard library. We need to include math.h header file to use sqrt() function. To fix this issue, add `#include <math.h>` at the top of your code.

The corrected version of your C code would look like:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h> // Include the math library
#define MAX_FACTORS                                                            \
  100 // maximum number of possible factors (for this size, the function should
      // work correctly)

long long int *factors(long n) {
  static long long int factors[MAX_FACTORS];
  int counter = 0;
  for (long test = n - 1; test >= sqrt(n); test--) {
    if (n % test == 0) {
      factors[counter++] = test;
      factors[counter++] = n / test;
    }
  }
   // sort the array using quicksort or similar method. Here, I just reverse it
   // to get factors from high to low
  for (int i = 0; i < counter / 2; i++) {
    long long int tmp = factors[i];
    factors[i] = factors[counter - 1 - i];
    factors[counter - 1 - i] = tmp;
  }
  return factors;
}
```
In this corrected version of code, the `#include <math.h>` at the top is necessary to use sqrt() function in C. The `factors` array was also declared with `long long int` to handle larger numbers than can be represented by a regular `long`. The rest of the code remains unchanged from your original implementation.
