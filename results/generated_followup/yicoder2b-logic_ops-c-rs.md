This problem seems to be related to C programming language conversion to Rust, since there are two errors when compiling the Rust code. The first one is that the `main` function is not found in the crate `yicoder2b_logic_ops_c_rs`, which has been defined in a file named `/tmp/yicoder2b-logic_ops-c-rs.rs`. To fix this error, we should add a main function to the Rust program.

The second error is that there's a mismatch between the types of variables `a` and `b` in the print statements. This can be fixed by changing the type of `a` from boolean (`bool`) to `&bool` (reference to boolean), as it must match with `b`.

Here is the corrected Rust code:
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut a = true;
    let mut b = false;

    // Output the result of "and" and "or" on both arguments as well as "not" on first argument
    println!("{} and {} is {}", a && b, &a, (a || b) && &a);
    println!("{} or {} is {}", a || b, &a, (a || b));
    println!("not {} is {}", a, !a);
}
```
To compile this code, you can run it in your terminal or command prompt.
