The error occurs because the `fs` package does not have an equivalent method to rename directories as it does in Rust. The `os.Rename()` function is used instead, which can be used for both renaming files and directories within the current working directory and at the filesystem root. However, it still doesn't have a built-in function to rename directories.

The fix is by removing the use of the `fs` package and using the `os.Rename()` function in its place. Additionally, we need to check if the method call returns an error before proceeding with the code execution. The revised Golang code will look like this:

```go
package main

import (
	 "io/fs"
	 "os"
)

func main()  {
	err := os.Rename("input.txt",  "output.txt")
	if err != nil {
		return // Handle the error
	}
	err = os.Rename("docs",  "mydocs")
	if err != nil {
		return // Handle the error
	}
	err = fs.Rename("/input.txt",  "/output.txt")
	if err != nil {
		return // Handle the error
	}
	err = fs.Rename("/docs",  "/mydocs")
	if err != nil {
		return // Handle the error
	}
}
```

Note that the function `os.Rename()` returns an error if the rename operation fails, so we handle it and return from the function if there's an error. This allows us to handle the errors gracefully without affecting the rest of the code execution. The final step is to implement a proper error handling mechanism within the `if err != nil` block to deal with any potential issues that may occur during the renaming process.
