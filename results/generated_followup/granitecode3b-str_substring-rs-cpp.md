The error is that the C++ compiler cannot find the necessary headers or standard libraries. The `#include` directive tells the compiler to include files, but the code snippet is missing those headers. To fix this, add the following lines at the beginning of the file:

The error message suggests that the `cout` and `endl` functions are not declared in the standard library. To fix this, add `using namespace std;` at the beginning of the file to import all standard library names into the current scope.

Here's the corrected code:
```c++
#include <iostream> // for cout and endl
#include <string>   // for string

using namespace std;

int main() {
  string s = "This is a sample string";

  size_t n = s.find("sample");
  cout << s.substr(n, 7) << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
