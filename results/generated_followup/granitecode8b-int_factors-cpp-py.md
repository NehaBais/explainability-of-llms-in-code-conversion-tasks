The error in the Python code is that it does not have an indented block after the `for` statement on line 3. In C++, the code inside the `for` loop is indented to indicate that it belongs to the loop. However, in Python, the code inside the loop should be indented by four spaces to indicate that it belongs to the loop. The fix for this error is to add four spaces before the line `if n % i == 0:`. Here is the corrected Python code:
```py
def generate_factors(n):
 factors = [1, n]
 for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
 if n % i == 0:
 factors.append(i)
 if i * i != n:
 factors.append(int(n / i))
 return sorted(factors)
sample_numbers = [3135, 45, 60, 81]
for num in sample_numbers:
 factors = generate_factors(num)
 print(f"Factors of {num} are: {' '.join(map(str, factors))}")
```
