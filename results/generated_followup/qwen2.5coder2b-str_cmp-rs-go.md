The error message indicates that the variables `a2` and `b2` are declared but not used in the program. This is a common mistake when copying code between languages, as the variable names might have been changed.

To fix this, we can simply remove these unused variables:

```go
package main

import (
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	a := "abc" // string
	b := "Bac" // string

	if strings.EqualFold(a, b) { // equality ignoring case
		println("The strings are equal")
	}

	// everything else
}
```

After making this change, the code should compile without errors.
