The error message indicates that there are multiple issues with the code. The first error is that the compiler cannot find the header files for the "string" type, which suggests that the C++ compiler does not have access to the standard library. To fix this issue, the program needs to be compiled using a C++ compiler that has access to the standard library.
The second error is related to the use of undeclared identifiers, such as "cout" and "endl". This indicates that the code is trying to use features of the C++ language that are not supported by the compiler being used. To fix this issue, the program needs to be written using only features that are supported by the compiler being used.
The third error is related to the use of undeclared identifiers, such as "cout" and "endl". This indicates that the code is trying to use features of the C++ language that are not supported by the compiler being used. To fix this issue, the program needs to be written using only features that are supported by the compiler being used.
The corrected code should include the necessary header files for the "string" type and use only features that are supported by the compiler being used. It should also include the proper syntax for declaring and initializing variables of type "string". Here is an example of corrected code:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main() {
  std::string str1("Hello");
  std::string str2("World");
  if (str1 == str2) {
    std::cout << "The strings are equal" << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "The strings are not equal" << std::endl;
  }
}
```
