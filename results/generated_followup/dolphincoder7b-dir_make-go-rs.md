The error occurs because the `Path` type is not defined in the context of this function. To fix this issue, we need to add an import statement for the `std::path::Path` type.
In Rust, the `std::fs` module provides functions for creating directories and reading directory contents, but not a function to create a directory with missing parents. Instead of using the `mkdirs` function from an external library or implementing it ourselves, we can use a loop to create each parent directory if they don't already exist:

```rust
use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::{create_dir};
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn mkdirs<P: AsRef<Path>>(dir: P) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let mut path = PathBuf::from(dir.as_ref());

    while !path.exists() {
        create_dir(&path)?;

        // Move one level up in the directory hierarchy.
        path.pop();
    }

    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    let dir  = "path/to/dir";

    match mkdirs(dir) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Created directory  {} successfully", dir),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error creating directory:  {}", e),
    }
}
```
In this updated version, we first create a `PathBuf` from the input directory path, and then enter a loop that continues as long as the current directory does not exist. Inside the loop, we use the `create_dir` function to create the current directory. If the operation fails for any reason (e.g., permission problem), the loop will exit immediately and return an error. After creating the directory, we remove one level up in the hierarchy by calling `pop`. Finally, we return the result wrapped in a `Result`, making it easier to handle errors in the calling code.
