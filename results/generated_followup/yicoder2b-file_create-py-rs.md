Your request requires several pieces of information that are not provided. For instance, it does not specify which programming language you want to convert the provided Python script into, or where in the filesystem you would like these new files and directories created. 

Here is a very general example of how one might interpret your question, based on some assumptions:

In this task, the job is to create an empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory called "docs" in both the current working directory and in the filesystem root.

The Rust code is as follows:
```rust
use std::fs;
fn create(directory: &str) {
    let mut output = fs::File::new(&format!("{}/output.txt", directory)).expect("Could not create output file");
    fs::OpenOptions::new()
        .write(true)
        .create(true)
        .open_for_append(&format!("{}/{}/docs", directory, &directory))
        .expect("Could not open for append docs directory");
}
fn main() {
    create("."); // current directory
    create("/"); // root directory
}
```
