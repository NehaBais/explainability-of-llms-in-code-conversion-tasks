The error is related to the preview features of Java 17, which are not enabled by default. To enable implicitly declared classes, use the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling the code. The fix is to add the `--enable-preview` flag to the compilation command. Here's the corrected code:
```java
String s = ", World";
s = "Hello" + s;
System.out.println(s);
```
