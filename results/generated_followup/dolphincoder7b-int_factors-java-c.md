The error message indicates that the TreeSet type is not defined within the file. The TreeSet data structure is implemented as a red-black tree in Java, but is not available in C. 

To fix this issue, we need to replace TreeSet with some equivalent data structure or code for obtaining the factors. Since we are only interested in finding the factors of a positive integer (and it doesn't matter which ones), we can use an array as our data structure and manually add the factors in the loop that checks divisibility:

```c
int factors(long n, int len, long factors[]) {
    // Add the original number to the list of factors
    factors[len++] = n;
    // Add 1 as a factor if it's not already included
    factors[len++] = 1L;

    for (long test = n - 1; test >= sqrt(n); test--) {
        if (n % test == 0) {
            factors[len++] = test;
            factors[len++] = n / test;
        }
    }
    return len;
}
```

After making these changes, the modified code should work correctly without any errors. This is because we are now using an array of long integers to store the factors and calculating them in a loop instead of using a TreeSet data structure.
