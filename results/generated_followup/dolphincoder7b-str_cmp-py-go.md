The error message is due to incorrect formatting of the string literals that are supposed to be printed using `fmt.Println()`. The backticks `\`` and `\\` inside the string literals are causing syntax errors when compiling the Go code. 

To fix this, remove unnecessary escape characters (`\` before the backtick or double backslash) from the string literals. Here is how you can rewrite the Python code to match the Go code:

```go
fmt.Println(
    "YUP  == YUP:", strings.EqualFold("YUP", "YUP"),
    "BALL  < BELL:", strings.Compare("BALL", "BELL") < 0,
    "24  > 123:", 24 > 123,
    // Comparison between two numbers will result in false, but the types are different, so it's not a string comparison
    "5 == 5.0:", 5 == 5.0)
)
```
