 The error message "undefined: a" and "undefined: b" tells us that the variables 'a' and 'b' are undefined, meaning they have not been declared or initialized before being used in conditional statements. This is because Go doesn't support implicit type inference like Rust for declaring and initializing new variables.

The fix would be to declare 'a' and 'b' as integers before the if-else ladder structure like so: `var a int` and `var b int`. 

After these changes, here is the corrected code in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)

	// Get first integer from user
	fmt.Print("Enter the first number: ")
	_, err1 := fmt.Scan(&a)

	if err1 != nil {
		panic(err1)
	}

	// Get second integer from user
	fmt.Print("Enter the second number: ")
	_, err2 := fmt.Scan(&b)

	if err2 != nil {
		panic(err2)
	}

	if a < b {
		fmt.Printf("%d is less than %d\n", a, b)
	} else if a == b {
		fmt.Printf("%d equals %d\n", a, b)
	} else if a > b {
		fmt.Printf("%d is greater than %d\n", a, b)
	}
}
```

This code will now compile and run as expected.
