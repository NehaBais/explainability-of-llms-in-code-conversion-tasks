Error: The C compiler is unable to find the necessary functions for string operations, such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `printf`. These functions are part of the standard library and must be included in the code.
Fix: Include the appropriate header files that provide these functions. For example, `#include <string.h>` for `strlen` and ` strcpy`, and `#include <stdio.h>` for `printf`.
Rewritten code:
```c
#include 
int main() {
  char s[] = "hello";
  char t[strlen(s) + 6]; // Add 6 to account for the additional characters
                         // needed for the string literal.
  strcpy(t, s);
  strcat(t, " there!");
  printf("%s", t);
  return 0;
}
```
