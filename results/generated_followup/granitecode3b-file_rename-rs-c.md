The error is that the `rename()` function is not supported in C. The C standard library does not provide an implementation of this function. To use it, you will need to link against a library that provides an implementation. You can do this by adding `-l Posix` to your compile flags.
Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include
#include 
const char *err = "File move error";
int main() {
  if (rename("input.txt", "output.txt") == -1) {
    perror(err);
  }
  if (rename("docs", "mydocs") == -1) {
    perror(err);
  }
  if (rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt") == -1) {
    perror(err);
  }
  if (rename("/docs", "/mydocs") == -1) {
    perror(err);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code uses the `rename()` function, which is available in most Unix-like operating systems. It also uses the `perror()` function to print an error message if the rename operation fails. Note that this code does not need any additional libraries or flags because the standard library provides an implementation of the `rename()` function.
