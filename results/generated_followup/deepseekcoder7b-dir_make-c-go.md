The error occurred because the "path/filepath" package is imported, but not used anywhere in the program. This package provides functions to manipulate slash-separated paths in a way that's compatible with the operating system's file path syntax. If it's not required in this case, one can remove it from import statement and the error will be resolved. 

The fix is to replace `import "path/filepath"` with `_ "path/filepath"`. The underscore (`_`) before `"path/filepath"` indicates that we only want its side effects, in this case initializing the filepath package but not using it elsewhere in the code.

Here is the corrected GoLang code:
```go
package main

import (
	"os"
	_ "path/filepath" // Removed unused import statement
)

func main() {
	dir := "./path/to/dir"
	if err := os.MkdirAll(dir, 0755); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```
