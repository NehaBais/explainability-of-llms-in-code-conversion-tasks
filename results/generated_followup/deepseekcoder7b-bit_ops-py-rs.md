The error message indicates that there are some issues with the format strings used in the print statements. The `{:0width$b}` is not valid in Rust's printf-style string formatting, which doesn't support variable width or precision as in Python's `f"{value:08b}"`.

The fix would be to replace these with a fixed width and use the bitwise AND operator for masking. Here is the corrected code:

```rs
fn main()  {
    bitwise_built_ins(32, 16, 9);
}

fn bitwise_built_ins(width: u32, a: u32, b: u32)  {
    let mask = (1 << width) - 1;
    
    println!("AND:     0b{:032b}\n& 0b{:032b}\n= "
             "0b{:032b}", a, b, (a & b) & mask);
    
    println!("OR:      0b{:032b}\n|\
             0b{:032b}\n= \
             0b{:032b}", a, b, (a | b) & mask);
            
    // Rest of the bitwise operations...
}
```

In this corrected version, I've added fixed width `32` to all print statements and used bitwise AND operator `&` for masking in bitwise_built_ins function. For example, instead of `{:0width$b}`, we use `{:032b}` which means zero-padded binary number with width 32.
