The error message is indicating that the compiler couldn't find 'bits/stdc++.h' header file, which is a standard C++ library used in this code. This library is typically available in Linux based systems but not all Windows systems or online compilers may have it installed by default. 

A common alternative to 'bits/stdc++.h' includes 'iostream', 'sstream', 'fstream', 'cstring', 'cassert' etc. Depending on your exact use case and what functionality you need from this library you might want to include specific headers instead or find equivalent libraries in the standard C++ library.

Here is a version of code that compiles successfully with just 'iostream' and 'bitset':
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

void bitwise(int16_t a, int16_t b) {
  cout << "a:   " << bitset<16>(a) << endl;
  cout << "b:   " << bitset<16>(b) << endl;
 ... // rest of the function body remains same as original code
}
int main() {
  bitwise(-460, 6);
  return 0;
}
```
