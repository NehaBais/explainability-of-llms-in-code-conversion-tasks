Error: The `atoi` function is not declared in the scope of the program, causing the compiler to report an error. This is because the `atoi` function is a part of the C standard library, which needs to be included before it can be used.

Fix: To fix the issue, you need to include the `<stdlib.h>` header file in your code, which provides the `atoi` function declaration. You can do this by adding the following line at the beginning of your code: `#include <stdlib.h>`. After making this change, the program should compile successfully.

Corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int a = atoi(argv[2]);
  int b = atoi(argv[3]);

  int sum = a + b;
  int difference = a - b;
  int product = a * b;
  float division = (float)a / b;
  int remainder = a % b;

  printf("a + b = %d\n",
         sum);
  printf("a - b = %d\n", difference);
  printf("a * b = %d\n", product);
  printf("a / b = %f\n", division);
  printf("a %% b = %d\n", remainder);

  return 0;
}
```
