The error in the above C++ code is related to header files not found in the current directory. The `#include <iostream>` statement means that it's looking for a file named 'iostream', which does not exist in your code. 

To fix this, you should ensure that 'iostream' is included in your project's compilation list (Right Click Project > Properties > Compilation Lists). If you can't see the 'Compilation Lists' tab or it's not visible because the interface changes based on the IDE being used, you can either manually add 'iostream' to the list or use a tool like CodeLens for IntelliJ.

Here is the corrected C++ code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void bitwise(int a, int b) {
  // perform a bitwise AND on 'a' and 'b', then print the result. Note that & is
  // an operator in C++
  std::cout << "a and b: " << (a & b) << std::endl;

  // perform a bitwise OR on 'a' and 'b', then print the result. Note that | is
  // an operator in C++
  std::cout << "a or b:  " << (a | b) << std::endl;

  // perform a bitwise XOR on 'a' and 'b', then print the result. Note that ^ is
  // an operator in C++
  std::cout << "a xor b: " << (a ^ b) << std::endl;

  // perform NOT operation on 'a', then print the result. Note that ~ is an
  // unary operator in C++
  std::cout << "not a:   " << (~a) << std::endl;

  // shift 'a' towards left by 'b' places, then print the result. Note that <<
  // is an operator in C++ but works differently than in C++
  std::cout << "a shl b: " << (a << b) << std::endl;

  // similar to above, right shift 'a' towards right by 'b' places and print the
  // result. Note that >> is an operator in C++ but works differently than in
  // C++
  std::cout << "a shr b: " << (a >> b) << std::endl;
  unsigned int ua = a;
  // rotate left 'ua' towards left by 'b' places and print the result. Note that
  // std::rotl is a function in the Standard Library c++20 and works differently
  // than in C++
  std::cout << "a lsr b: " << (std::rotl(ua, b)) << std::endl;

  // rotate right 'ua' towards right by 'b' places and print the result. Note
  // that std::rotr is a function in the Standard Library c++20 and works
  // differently than in C++
  std::cout << "a ror b: " << (std::rotr(ua, b)) << std::endl;
}
```
