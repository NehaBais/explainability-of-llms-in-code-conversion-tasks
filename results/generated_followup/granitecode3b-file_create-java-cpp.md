Error: Expected "FILENAME" or <FILENAME>
Fix: Replace `"output.txt"` with `"/tmp/output.txt"` to specify the full path and filename for the file.
Rewritten code:
```cpp
#include
#include
using namespace std;
int main() {
  try {
    ofstream file1("/tmp/output.txt");
    if (file1) {
      cout << "File created successfully" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "Error creating file" << endl;
    }
    file1.close();

    string command = "mkdir docs";
    int result = system(command.c_str());
    if (result == 0) {
      cout << "Directory created successfully" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "Error creating directory" << endl;
    }

    string rootCommand = "mkdir /docs";
    result = system(rootCommand.c_str());
    if (result == 0) {
      cout << "Directory created successfully in root" << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "Error creating directory in root" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
  }
catch (exception& e) {
  cout << e.what() << endl;
  return -1;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the code was trying to include `std::ofstream` before it had been included in the C++ file, which caused the compiler to report an error. The fix is to replace `"output.txt"` with `"/tmp/output.txt"` to specify the full path and filename for the file.
