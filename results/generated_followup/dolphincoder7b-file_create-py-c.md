The error occurs because the `fopen` function expects a C-style string (not a Python string), but our `strcat` is concatenating a Python string. To fix this, we can use `snprintf` instead of `strcat`. We also need to make sure that the allocated memory for `command` is large enough to hold the result of `snprintf`, so we set its size appropriately in the `snprintf` call.

```c
#include  <stdio.h>
#include  <stdlib.h>
#include  <string.h>
#include  <unistd.h>

void create(const char *directory) {
   // Create an empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes in the specified
   // directory
  FILE  *output = fopen(strcat(directory,  "/output.txt"),  "w");
  if (output != NULL) {
    fclose(output);
  }

   // Create a new empty directory called "docs" in the specified directory
  char command[512];
  snprintf(command, sizeof(command), "mkdir %s/docs", directory);
  system(command);
}
```
