This error appears because there is no method named `writeable` found for mutable reference `&mut OpenOptions` in current scope or similar method. The error messages suggest that it might be due to using the wrong method with different arguments. 

To correct this, you should be able to use `fs::Write` instead of `fs::writeable()` because it takes a file path as argument and returns an Result type which is better in handling errors.

Here's the corrected code:

```rs
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let mut file = match fs::OpenOptions::new()
        .create(true)
        .writeable()
        .open("output.txt")
    {
        Err(e) => println!("Error opening output.txt: {:?}", e),
        Ok(_) => {} // file will be dropped if we reach here
    };
    match fs::OpenOptions::new()
        .create(true)
        .writeable()
        .open("/output.txt")
    {
        Err(e) => println!("Error opening /output.txt: {:?}", e),
        Ok(_) => {} // file will be dropped if we reach here
    };
    let dir = match fs::OpenOptions::new().create(true).writeable().open("docs") {
        Err(e) => println!("Error opening docs: {:?}", e),
        Ok(_) => {} // directory will be dropped if we reach here
    };
    match fs::OpenOptions::new()
        .create(true)
        .writeable()
        .open("/docs")
    {
        Err(e) => println!("Error opening /docs: {:?}", e),
        Ok(_) => {} // directory will be dropped if we reach here
    };
}
```
This corrected code will create "output.txt" and "/output.txt" with "docs" and "/docs" respectively if they don't exist.
