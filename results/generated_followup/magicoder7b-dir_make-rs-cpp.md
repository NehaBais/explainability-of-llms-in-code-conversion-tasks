 The error message "no member named 'filesystem' in namespace 'std'" means that the `std::filesystem` namespace, which is needed to use `std::filesystem::create_directories`, does not exist in the C++ standard library. It is a relatively new feature introduced in C++17 and it might be possible that your compiler doesn't support it yet (some older versions of GCC for example).

The fix would be to upgrade your compiler to a version that supports C++17, or use another way to create directories if `std::filesystem` is not available. For instance, you could use the POSIX function `mkdir -p`, available on many systems including Linux and macOS.

Here's how you would do it with POSIX functions:

```cpp
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  int result = mkdir("./path/to/dir", S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH);
  
  if (result != 0) {
    perror("An error occurred!");
  }
}
```

In this code, `mkdir` is used to create the directory and its parents. The second argument specifies permissions for the directories which are group read/write, others cannot access. If there is an error in creating the directories (for example, if they already exist or if it doesn't have sufficient permissions), then a message will be printed with `perror`, describing the error encountered.
