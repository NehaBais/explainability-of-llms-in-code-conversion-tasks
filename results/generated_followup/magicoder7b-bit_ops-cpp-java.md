 The error message "/tmp/Main.java:28: error: variable ua is already defined in method bitwiseOperation(int,int) int ua = a;" indicates that Java doesn't allow redefinition of variables with the same name within a method or constructor. Therefore, we need to either rename `ua` to something else or remove it entirely because it seems like we are not using it for anything.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 15; // For example
    int b = 3; // For example

    bitwiseOperation(a, b);
  }

  private static void bitwiseOperation(int a, int b) {
    System.out.println("a and b: " + (a & b));
    System.out.println("a or b:  " + (a | b));
    System.out.println("a xor b: " + (a ^ b));
    System.out.println("not a:   " + ~a);

    // Java does not support the left-shift operator on negative numbers or with shift counts
    // greater or equal to
    // the number of bits in an integer. But as it's guaranteed to work for positive values, no need
    // to check for that case.
    System.out.println("a shl b: " + (a << b));

    System.out.println("a shr b: " + (a >> b));
    // Java's logical right shift, guaranteed to work for all rotation amounts.
    System.out.println(
        "a lsr b: "
            + ((a >>> b))); 

    // The rotateLeft() function from the java.lang.Integer class provides an equivalent of a rotation operation, while rotateRight() is also available in Java's standard library.
    System.out.println("a rol b: " + Integer.rotateLeft(a, b));
    System.out.println("a ror b: " + Integer.rotateRight(a, b));
  }
}
```
