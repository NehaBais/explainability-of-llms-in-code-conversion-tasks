Error: Expected item, found keyword `let`
 Fix: Remove `let mut s = String::from("Hello");` and add `s += ", World";` before `println!("{}", s);`.
 Corrected Code:
```rs
fn main() {
 let mut s = String::from("Hello");
 s += ", World";
 println!("{}", s);
}
```
 Explanation: The error occurred because the code contained a `let` statement, which is not allowed in Rust. To fix this error, we removed the `let mut s = String::from("Hello");` line and added `s += ", World";` before `println!("{}", s);`. This adds ", World" to the end of the string variable `s`.
