Error: Call to undeclared library function with type 'unsigned long (const char *)'; ISO C99 and later do not support implicit function declarations.
Fix: Include the header <string.h> or explicitly provide a declaration for 'strlen', 'strcpy', 'strcat', and 'printf'.
```c
#include stdio.h
#include <string.h>
int main() {
  char s[] = "World";
  char new_s[strlen("Hello ") + strlen(s)];
  strcpy(new_s, "Hello ");
  strcat(new_s, s);
  printf("%sn", new_s);
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurs because the C standard library does not include a `strlen` function, so we need to include the `<string.h>` header file and explicitly provide a declaration for it in our code. Similarly, we also need to include the `<stdio.h>` header file to provide a declaration for `printf`.
