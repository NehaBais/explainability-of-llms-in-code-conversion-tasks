The error occurs because the `+` operator is used to concatenate strings, but it returns a new string that is owned by the compiler, so we cannot assign it to a variable of type `&str`. To fix this issue, we can use the `format!` macro to create a new string that is borrowed from the compiler.
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut s: &str;
    s = "world!";
    s = format!("Hello, {}", s);
}
```
