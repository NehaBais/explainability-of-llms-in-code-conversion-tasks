 The error `Undefined symbols for architecture arm64` appears when your C program is not correctly linked with libraries or other object files which it needs to run properly. This can occur if you are trying to run a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit system or if you have forgotten to include necessary header files in your code.

To fix this, make sure you've included all necessary library files and header files required by your program. If you're working with C, you might need to add `-std=c99` or `-std=c11` when compiling to ensure that the compiler recognizes the `void`, `int`, `!`, `||`, etc., operators.

Here is the corrected code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

void logic(int a, int b) {
  // Print 'a and b' result
  if (a && b)
    printf("a and b: true\n");
  else
    printf("a and b: false\n");

  // Print 'a or b' result
  if (a || b)
    printf("a or b: true\n");
  else
    printf("a or b: false\n");

  // Print 'not a' result
  if (!a)
    printf("not a: true\n");
  else
    printf("not a: false\n");
}
```

You can call this function `logic` with two boolean arguments to see the output. For instance, `logic(1, 0);`. This code should now compile and link properly on most systems.
