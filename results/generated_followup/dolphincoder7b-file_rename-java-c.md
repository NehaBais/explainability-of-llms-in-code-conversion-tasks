The error message indicates that the keywords "using" and "public" were not recognized by the C# compiler because they are not part of the standard C# language definition. The correct way to import namespaces in C# is to use the "using" keyword followed by the namespace name. The same applies for the access modifier "public".

To fix this issue, we need to replace these keywords with their corresponding equivalents. Here's how it can be done:

```csharp
// Importing the necessary namespaces
using System;
using System.IO;

public class FileRenameTest  {
   public static bool RenameFile(string oldname, string newname) {
     // File (or directory) with old name
    var file = new FileInfo(oldname);

     // File (or directory) with new name
    var file2 = new FileInfo(newname);

     // Rename file (or directory)
    return file.MoveTo(file2.FullName);
   }

   public static void Test(string type, string oldname, string newname) {
     Console.WriteLine($"The following {type} called {oldname} " 
                       + $"{(RenameFile(oldname, newname) ? " was renamed as" 
                         : " could not be renamed into")}  " 
                       + $"{newname}.");
   }

   public static void Main()  {
    Test("file", "input.txt",  "output.txt");
    Test("file", Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "input.txt"), 
         Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "output.txt"));
     // test("directory",  "docs",  "mydocs");   // Not implemented in C#
     // test("directory", Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()  + 
     //      Path.DirectorySeparatorChar  +  "docs"  + Path.DirectorySeparatorChar, 
     //      Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()  + Path.DirectorySeparatorChar  +  "mydocs" 
     //      + Path.DirectorySeparatorChar);   // Not implemented in C#
   }
}
```

In this updated code block, we have replaced the "using" and "public" keywords with their equivalents. Additionally, we have corrected some issues with the file and directory paths to ensure that they are constructed correctly for the specific system being used (Windows or Unix-based).
