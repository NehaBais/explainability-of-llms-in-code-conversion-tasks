Error: The `+` operator is not defined for two operands of type `char[4]` and `char *`. This is because arrays and pointers are not compatible in C, and you cannot add them together as if they were numbers.

Fix: Replace the `+` operator with a call to the `strcat()` function, which concatenates two strings. So the corrected line should be `strcat(new_string, "abc")`.

Corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char *string = "def";
  char new_string[5];
  strcat(new_string, "abc");

  printf("%s", new_string);

  return 0;
}
```
