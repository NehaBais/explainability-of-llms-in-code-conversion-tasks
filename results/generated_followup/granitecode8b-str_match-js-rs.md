The error message indicates that the `let` keyword is being used to declare a new variable, but it seems that the code was intended to use the `const` or `static` keywords instead. The `let` keyword is typically used for local variables, while `const` and `static` are used for variables that should be constant or statically allocated, respectively.
The fix is to change all instances of `let` to `const` or `static`. Here's the corrected code:
```rs
const string_a: &str = "tacoloco";
const string_b: &str = "co";
let mut q1 = false;
let mut q2 = None;
let mut q3 = false;
let mut matches = Vec::new();
// stringA starts with stringB
q1 = string_a.starts_with(string_b);
// stringA contains stringB
q2 = string_a.find(string_b);
// multiple matches
for mat in string_a.match_indices(string_b) {
	matches.push(mat.0);
}
// stringA ends with stringB
q3 = string_a.ends_with(string_b);
println!("1: Does '{}' start with '{}'? {}", string_a, string_b, q1);
println!("2: Is '{}' contained in '{}'?", string_b, string_a);
if let Some(index) = q2 {
	println!("   In fact, it happens {} times within '{}', at index{}.", matches.len(), string_a, if matches.len() > 1 {"es"} else {""});
	println!("       The first match is at index {}.", index);
} else {
	println!("   No.");
}
println!("3: Does '{}' end with '{}'? {}", string_a, string_b, q3);
```
This code should now compile without errors and do the same thing as the JavaScript code you provided. It uses Rust's `const` keyword to declare variables that should be constant, which is appropriate for variables that are not expected to change during the execution of the program. The rest of the code remains largely unchanged, with some minor adjustments made to handle the multiple matches case.
