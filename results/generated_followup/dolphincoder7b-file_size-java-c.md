The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the `stat` function definition, which is used in line 5 of the provided C code. This is due to the fact that the struct stat has not been defined or declared before being used in the program.

To fix this issue, we need to add a forward declaration for the struct stat at the beginning of the file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
struct stat;  // Forward declaration
int main(void) {
  struct stat st;
  if (stat("input.txt", &st) != 0) {
    printf("File doesn't exist.\n");
    return -1;
   }
  printf("%ld bytes\n",  (long)st.st_size);

  if (stat("/input.txt", &st) != 0) {
    printf("File in root directory doesn't exist.\n");
    return -2;
   }
  printf("%ld bytes\n",  (long)st.st_size);
  return 0;
}
```

In this fixed version, we have included the forward declaration `struct stat;` at the beginning of the file to resolve the error. This allows the compiler to locate and use the definition of the struct stat before it is actually used in the program.
