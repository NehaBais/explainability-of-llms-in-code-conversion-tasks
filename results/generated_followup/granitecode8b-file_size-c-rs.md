The error message indicates that there is an unresolved import for `struct_stat` from the `libc` crate. This means that Rust cannot find the definition of the `struct_stat` struct in the `libc` crate. To fix this, you need to add the path to the `struct_stat` definition in the `libc` crate to your `Cargo.toml` file.

Once you've added the path, you can import the `struct_stat` struct and use it in your code like this:
```rs
use libc::struct_stat;
let mut foo = unsafe { std::mem::MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init() };
let res = unsafe { libc::stat("file.txt".as_ptr(), &mut foo) };
if res != 0 {
    // handle error
}
let file_size = (foo.st_size as *const _) as usize;
```
Note that you need to make sure that the path in your `Cargo.toml` file is correct and points to a valid definition of the `struct_stat` struct in the `libc` crate. If the path is incorrect, you may get an error indicating that the `struct_stat` struct cannot be found.
