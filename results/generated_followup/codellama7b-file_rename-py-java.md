Error: The Java compiler is not able to find the `Files` class, which is part of the NIO (Non-Blocking I/O) API in Java.
Fix: To fix this error, you need to add --enable-preview flag at the beginning of your code to enable the implicitly declared classes feature.

This will allow you to use the `Files` class and other new language features that are part of the preview release.
Corrected Code:
```java
import java.nio.file.*;
Path input = Paths.get("input.txt");
Path output = Paths.get("output.txt");
Path docs = Paths.get("docs");
Path mydocs = Paths.get("mydocs");

Files.move(input, output);
Files.move(docs, mydocs);
```
