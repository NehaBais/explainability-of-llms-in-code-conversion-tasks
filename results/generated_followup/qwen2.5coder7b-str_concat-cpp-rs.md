**Error Explanation:** The error message indicates that there is an invalid character '.' in the crate name, which is typically used to specify the project's crate name.

**Fix Explanation:** To fix this error, we need to remove or replace the invalid character '.' from the crate name.

Here is the corrected code:

```rs
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    println!("{} literal", s);
    let s2 = format!("{} literal", s);
    println!("{}", s2);
}
```

The above code doesn't require any changes as it's already valid Rust syntax. If you encounter the error, ensure your crate name is correctly specified without invalid characters.
