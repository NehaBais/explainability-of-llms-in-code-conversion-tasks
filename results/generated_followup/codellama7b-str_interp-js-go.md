The error occurred because the `original` variable is not declared as part of the package, so it is missing the "package" declaration at the beginning of the file. The fix is to add the "package" declaration at the beginning of the file, followed by a newline character and then the `original` variable declaration.

Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main

import (
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	original := "Mary had a X lamb."
	little := "little"
	replaced := strings.ReplaceAll(original, "X", little)
}
```
