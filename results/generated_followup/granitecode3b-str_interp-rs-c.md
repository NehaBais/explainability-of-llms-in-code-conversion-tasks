Error: The Rust code uses `println` function to print the interpolated string, while C code uses `printf` function to print the same string. Additionally, Rust supports named arguments for placeholders, while C doesn't have this feature.
Fix: Change the println calls in Rust code to use printf function with appropriate arguments.
Corrected code:
```c
#include 
int main() {
  printf("Mary had a %s lambn", "little");
  // You can specify order
  printf("%sn%s had a %sns %s lamb", "little", "Mary", "little", "Mary");
  // Or named arguments if you prefer
  printf("%s had a %sns lambn", "Mary", "little", "Mary", "little");
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurs because the Rust code uses `println` function to print the interpolated string, while C code uses `printf` function to print the same string. Additionally, Rust supports named arguments for placeholders, while C doesn't have this feature. To fix this error, we need to change the println calls in Rust code to use printf function with appropriate arguments. This will ensure that the output is printed correctly and the order of arguments in the format string matters as expected in C.
