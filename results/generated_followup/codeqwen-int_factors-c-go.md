The error message states that "undefined: dvsr", indicating that Golang does not know what `dvsr` is. It seems to be defined within an if statement, but Go requires explicit scope for variables declared inside If statements.

The fix is simply adding the keyword `var` before `dvsr`. This will declare a new variable named `dvsr`. 
Corrected code:
```go
		var dvsr int
		for dvsr = 1; dvsr*dvsr < num; dvsr++ {
```
