This error arises because the variable `fd` is not declared in the context where it's being used. Here are the solutions: 
1) If you declare `fd` before using it, this error will go away. For example:
2) If you need to use `fd` in a different context, ensure that the variable is declared there. For example:
```c
int main() {
    //Declaration of fd
    int fd;
    //Code using fd
    fd = open("/docs", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
    if (fd >= 0) {
       close(fd);
    }
}
```
