Error: "use of undeclared identifier" for variables "a", "b", "cout", "cin".
Fix: Declare "a" and "b" as integers before using them in the if statements.
Corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b;

  cout << "Enter two integers: ";
  cin >> a >> b;

  if (a < b) {
    cout << a << " is less than " << b << endl;
  } else if (a == b) {
    cout << a << " equals " << b << endl;
  } else {
    cout << a << " is greater than " << b << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the variables "a", "b", "cout", and "cin" were not declared as integers before they were used in the if statements. This caused a "use of undeclared identifier" error. To fix this, we declared "a" and "b" as integers before using them in the if statements.
