The error is that Python requires indentation for the body of the loop, not just the `for` statement. To fix this, simply add four spaces at the beginning of each line inside the loop. The corrected code is as follows:
```py
def generate_factors(n):
 factors = [1, n]
 for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
 if n % i == 0:
 factors.append(i)
 if n / i != i:
 factors.append(n // i)
 return sorted(factors)
 
sample_numbers = [3135, 45, 60, 81]
for num in sample_numbers:
 print(f"Factors of {num} are: {generate_factors(num)}")
```
This code should now work as intended.
