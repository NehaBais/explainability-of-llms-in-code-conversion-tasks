**Error Explanation:** The error is due to an invalid character '.' in the crate name `qwen2.5coder7b_logic_ops_py_rs`.

**Fix:** Remove or replace the invalid character from the crate name.

Here is the corrected code:

```rust
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a || b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);
}

fn main() {
    logic(true, false);
}
```

This code defines a function `logic` that takes two boolean arguments and prints the results of logical AND, OR, and NOT operations on them. The `main` function calls `logic` with `true` and `false`.
