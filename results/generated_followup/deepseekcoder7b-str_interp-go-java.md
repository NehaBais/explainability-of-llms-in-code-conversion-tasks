The error occurs because of incorrect usage of `System.out<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>.out.println(out);` which isn't valid Java syntax. It seems like there may be some confusion with the language being used here, as 's' doesn't seem to follow a standard naming convention for classes in java such as System.out.

The corrected code block would look like this:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)  {
        String str = "Mary had a %s lamb";
        String txt = "big";
        String out = String.format(str, txt);
        System.out.println(out); // This should print "Mary had a big lamb"
    }
}
```
