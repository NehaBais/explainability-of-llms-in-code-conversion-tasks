The error in the code is that it uses C++ syntax and libraries that are not supported by Golang. To fix this, we can use the `os` package in Go to achieve the same functionality as the C++ code. The corrected code is shown below:
```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)
func main() {
	file, err := os.Open("data.txt")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer file.Close()
	stat, err := file.Stat()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("File size:", stat.Size())
}
```
This code opens a file named "data.txt", gets its size using the `Stat()` method, and prints it to the console. It also handles any errors that may occur during the process.
