The error is caused by using a period (`.`) in the crate name, which is not allowed.

To fix this, remove the `qwen2.5coder7b_str_concat_js_rs` from the file name and replace it with a valid identifier.

Here's the corrected code:

```rs
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    println!("{} there!", s);
}
```
