The error is on line 12: `Unexpected token ')'`. The problem lies with the usage of the join function, which requires an iterable (an array) as its argument. However, in your original Python code, you are trying to use the join method directly on a string variable 's1'. This leads to a syntax error because the join method is not applicable to a plain string like 's1'.
To fix this issue, we need to convert the string 's1' into an array containing only one element: 'hello'. Then, we can use the join method on this array and concatenate it with another string literal (' "world"').
Here is the corrected code block in a single fenced code block:
```js
let s1 = "hello";
let s2 = ", ".join([s1, "world", "mom"])) + " world";
console.log(s1, s2);
```
In this fixed version of the code, we have converted the string variable `s1` into an array containing only one element: 'hello'. Then, we used the join method on this array and concatenated it with another string literal (' "world"'). Finally, we printed out both the variables `s1` and `s2`.
