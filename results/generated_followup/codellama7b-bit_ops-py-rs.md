The error is caused by using the `~` operator on a value of type `i32`, which is not allowed. The compiler suggests replacing it with the `!` operator, which performs bitwise negation.

To fix the issue, replace all instances of `~a` with `!a`. This will ensure that the code compiles successfully.
```
let n: i32 = 5;
let a: i32 = 10;
let width: u8 = 4;
println!("{}", (a >> (-n % width)) | ((1 << width) - 1));
println!("{}", (a >> (n % width)));
```
