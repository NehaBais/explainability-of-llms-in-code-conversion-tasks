The error is caused by Rust's syntax for crate names. It must consist of alphanumeric characters, underscores, or slashes. The string `"qwen2.5coder2b_str_concat_java_rs"` contains a dot which is not allowed in Rust crate name.

To fix the error, you need to rename your crate, replacing the dot with an underscore:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s: &str = "hello"; 
    println!("s = {}", s); 
    let s2 = format!("{} literal", s); 
    println!("s2 = {}", s2);
}
```

This will compile without errors.
