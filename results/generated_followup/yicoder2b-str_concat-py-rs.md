The error `E0308` occurs when two variables of different types are being compared, which is impossible because Rust doesn't allow implicitly converting between types for operations. The solution to this error is to use the conversion method `to_string()` on `s1`. That should fix the issue, as it converts the string literal "hello" into a `String` type instead of a `&str` (shortcut for String Literal).
