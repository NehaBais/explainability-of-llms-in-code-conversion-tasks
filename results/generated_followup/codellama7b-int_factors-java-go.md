The error occurs because the `main` function is not defined in the main package, which is the default package for Go programs. In Java, the `public static void main(String[] args)` method is used to define the entry point of a program, but in Go, you must define your own `main` function and specify it as the entry point using the `-main` flag during compilation.

To fix the error, you can define your own `main` function in the `factors` package:
```go
package main

import (
	"math"
)

func main() {
	factors := factors(10) // Replace 10 with a desired integer input
	fmt.Println(factors)
}

func factors(n int64) []int64 {
	factors := make([]int64, 0)
	factors = append(factors, n)
	factors = append(factors, 1)
	for test := int64(math.Sqrt(float64(n))); test > 1; test-- {
		if n%test == 0 {
			factors = append(factors, test)
			factors = append(factors, n/test)
		}
	}
	return factors
}
```
And compile the program using the `-main` flag:

go build -o main -main .

This will create a `main` executable that can be run to output the factors of the input integer.
