Error: The imported package "unsafe" is not used anywhere in the code, causing an error during compilation. 

Fix: Import and use the "unsafe" package to perform unsafe operations like array slicing or pointer manipulation. However, since none of these unsafe operations are performed in this particular code snippet, it would be best to remove the import statement for the "unsafe" package entirely. This ensures that any potential unsafe operations are caught during compilation if they were accidentally included.

Corrected Code:
```go
package main

import (
		"fmt"
	)

func main() {
		// Create a string variable equal to any text value.
		str := "Good Morning"

		// Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way.
		str += " to all"
		str += " !!!"

		// Print the contents of the variable after the append operation.
		fmt.Println(str)
	}
```
