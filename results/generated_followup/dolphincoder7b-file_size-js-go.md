The error occurs because "path/filepath" is imported but not used by the script. To fix this, replace the import statement with a blank identifier (_) to indicate that you are not using the "path/filepath" package in the script.

Here's how you would check the size of a file called input.txt for a file in the current working directory and another one in the file system root:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	_ "path/filepath" // Imported but not used
	"os"
)

func checkFile(filename string) {
	info, err := os.Stat(filename)
	if os.IsNotExist(err) {
		fmt.Printf("%s does not exist\n", filename)
	} else if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
	} else {
		sizeInBytes := info.Size()
		sizeInKB := float64(sizeInBytes) / 1024
		fmt.Printf("%s is %f KB in size.\n", filename, sizeInKB)
	}
}

func main() {
	checkFile("input.txt") // Check for file "input.txt" in the current working directory
	checkFile("/input.txt") // Check for file "/input.txt" in the file system root
}
```

Note that this script assumes that both files exist and are accessible, so potential error handling is omitted for simplicity. The error checking code should be added to handle potential errors while opening or reading files.
