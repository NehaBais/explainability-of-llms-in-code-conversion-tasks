The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the header files "iostream" and "string". This is because the C++ standard library uses these headers to provide input/output and string manipulation functionality. To fix this, we need to include the necessary header files at the beginning of the program:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
int main() {
  std::string s = "hello";
  std::cout << s + " there!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
By including these headers, we can use the `std::string` class and the input/output functions provided by the standard library.
