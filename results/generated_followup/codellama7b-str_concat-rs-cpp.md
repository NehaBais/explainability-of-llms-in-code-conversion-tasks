Error: The code contains undefined identifiers, such as "string" and "cout".
Fix: Ensure that the necessary libraries are included in the code and that the identifiers are defined correctly.
Corrected code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::string s = "hello";
  std::cout << s << std::endl;

  std::string s1 = s + " world";
  std::cout << s1 << std::endl;
}
```
