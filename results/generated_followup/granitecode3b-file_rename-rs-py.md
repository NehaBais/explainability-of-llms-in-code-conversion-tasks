The error was caused by the incorrect indentation of the `try` statement inside the `rename_root()` function in Python. The correct way to indent the `try` statement is by adding four spaces before it, as shown below:
```python
import os
def rename_file():
 err = "File move error"
 try:
 os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
 os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
 except OSError as e:
 print(f"{e.strerror} ({e.errno})")
def rename_root():
 err = "File move error"
 try:
 os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
 os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
 except OSError as e:
 print(f"{e.strerror} ({e.errno})")
rename_file()
rename_root()
``` 
This will ensure that the `try` statement is indented correctly and will execute the code inside it without any errors.
