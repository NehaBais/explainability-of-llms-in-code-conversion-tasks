The error is caused by incorrect type names 'uint16_t', 'uint8_t' and identifiers like 'print' which are not declared or used correctly in the provided C code. The fix would be to include the necessary header files for these data types and correct usage of them in the program, along with declaring and using functions properly.

The corrected version of your C code is:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <inttypes.h>

void print_bin(uint16_t n) {
    for (int i = 15; i >= 0; --i) {
        printf("%d", (n >> i) & 1);
    }
}

void bitwise(uint16_t a, uint8_t b) {
    printf("shr: "); print_bin(a >> 2);
}

int main() {
    uint16_t a = 460;  // Change these values as per your requirement.
    uint8_t b = 2;     // Change these values as per your requirement.
  
    bitwise(a, b);

    return 0;
}
```
