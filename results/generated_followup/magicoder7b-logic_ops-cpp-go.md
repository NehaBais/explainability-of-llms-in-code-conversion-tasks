The error message "/tmp/magicoder7b-logic_ops-cpp-go.go:5:2: package logical is not in std (/opt/homebrew/Cellar/go/1.23.0/libexec/src/logical)" suggests that the `logical` package was not found in the standard library (`std`). The error may arise if you've imported a non-existing package or if the path to the package is incorrect.

To fix this, create your own custom boolean operations package or use an existing one like `github.com/rocketlaunchr/go-logical`. If you want to create a new package then follow the steps below:

1. Create a new directory for the package outside of GOPATH.
2. Inside this directory, create another directory with the same name as your package (e.g., "logical").
3. Inside logical directory, create `operations.go` and define your operations there.
4. Save this file and then run `go install` in the directory where you have your package files. This should compile and install your package to `$GOPATH/bin`.
5. Now your custom package is ready to be imported from any other Go file.

The corrected code would look like:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"logical" // For logical operations
)

func printLogic(a bool, b bool) {
	fmt.Printf("A and B is %v\n", logical.And(a, b))
	fmt.Printf("A or B is %v\n", logical.Or(a, b))
	fmt.Printf("Not A is %v\n", !a)
}
```
