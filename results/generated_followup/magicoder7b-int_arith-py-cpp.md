 The error is due to the use of the modulus operator `%` which does not work with `float` values, but instead works specifically with `int`. When cast as a float, the remainder value is a decimal number and can't be rounded to an integer.

The fix involves casting the inputs and the result of the modulus operation back to integers before applying the `%` operator.

This will round the result correctly. It first casts `input1` and `input2` to floats, calculates the modulus of these values, then casts them back to integers before applying the `%` operator.

The whole program is now:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int input1 = 18;
  // cin >> input1;
  int input2 = 7;
  // cin >> input2;

  int qq = input1 + input2;
  cout << "Sum:            " << qq << endl;
  int ww = input1 - input2;
  cout << "Difference:     " << ww << endl;
  int ee = input1 * input2;
  cout << "Product:        " << ee << endl;
  float rr = (float)input1 / input2;
  cout << "Float quotient: " << rr << endl;
  double tt = static_cast<double>(input1) / input2;
  int uu = round(tt);
  cout << "Integer Remainder:  " << uu << endl;
  cout << "Actual Remainder:   " 
       << ((static_cast<int>(static_cast<float>(input1))) % (static_cast<int>(static_cast<float>(input2)))) << endl;
  int yy = pow(input1, input2);
  cout << "Exponentiation:  " << yy << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
