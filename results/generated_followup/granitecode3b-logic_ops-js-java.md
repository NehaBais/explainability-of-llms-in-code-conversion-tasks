The error is caused by the preview feature of Java 11, which requires explicitly declaring classes before using them. The `&&` and `||` operators are implicitly declared in Java 11, so they need to be explicitly declared as well.
To fix this error, you can either use explicit class declarations or enable the preview feature by adding `--enable-preview` to your compiler command line.
Here's the corrected code:
```java
public static void logic(boolean a, boolean b) {
 System.out.println("a AND b: " + (a && b));
 System.out.println("a OR b: " + (a || b));
 System.out.println("NOT a: " + (!a));
}
```
Or you can enable the preview feature by adding `--enable-preview` to your compiler command line before compiling the code.
