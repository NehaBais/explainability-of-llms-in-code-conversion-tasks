The error occurs because the C++ compiler cannot find the `std` library, which is required to use the `string` type and other standard library functions. To fix this, you need to include the appropriate header file for the `std` library. In this case, you can add the following line at the top of your C++ code:
```cpp
#include 
```
The error in the first code block is because the compiler cannot find the `string` type or any other standard library functions. The fix is to include the appropriate header file for the `std` library.
