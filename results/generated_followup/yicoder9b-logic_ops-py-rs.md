The error "`main` function not found in crate `yicoder9b_logic_ops_py_rs`" occurred because there was no main function defined in the Rust program, which is required for execution of any Rust program. The main function in Rust is the entry point to a program. The fix is to define a main function and place your logic function inside it as follows:

```rs
fn main() {
    logic(true, false); // Call to 'logic' function with sample inputs 
}

fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a || b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);
}
```
