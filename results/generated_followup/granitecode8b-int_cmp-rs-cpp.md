The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the `std` library headers, which are required for the code to compile. 
This will include the standard input/output and string stream libraries, which are necessary for the code to work.
The corrected code is as follows:
```cpp
#include
int main() {
  std::string buffer;
  std::getline(std::cin, buffer);
  std::istringstream stream(buffer);
  int a, b;
  stream >> a >> b;
  if (a < b) {
    std::cout << a << " is less than " << b << std::endl;
  } else if (a == b) {
    std::cout << a << " equals " << b << std::endl;
  } else if (a > b) {
    std::cout << a << " is greater than " << b << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code prompts the user to enter two integers, reads them from `std::cin`, and stores them in variables `a` and `b`. Then, it uses conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, and `else`) to compare `a` and `b` and display a message based on their relationship.
Note that this code assumes that the user will enter valid integers as input. If you want to handle invalid input or other errors, you may need to add additional error handling code.
