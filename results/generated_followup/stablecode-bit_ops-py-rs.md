The error in a single line is: "error: mismatched closing delimiter: `)`". This occurred because there was an unclosed parenthesis at line 41.

To fix this, we need to add an opening parenthesis at the beginning of each of the lines within the loop on line 41. Here's the corrected code in a single fenced code block:
```rust
fn bitwise_built_ins(width: u32, a: u64, b: u64) {
    let mask = ((1 << width) - 1) as u64;

    println!("AND:\t\t0b{a:0{width}b}} 
            & 
0b{b:0{width}b}}
            = 
0b{(a & b) & mask :0{width}b}}",
        a = a,
        b = b,
        width = width,
    );

    println!(
        "OR:\t\t0b{a:0{width}b}} 
            | 
0b{b:0{width}b}}
            = 
0b{(a | b) & mask :0{width}b}}",
        a = a,
        b = b,
        width = width,
    );

    println!(
        "XOR:\t\t0b{a:0{width}b}} 
            ^ 
0b{b:0{width}b}}
            = 
0b{(a ^ b) & mask :0{width}b}}",
        a = a,
        b = b,
        width = width,
    );

    println!(
        "NOT:\t\t~ 0b{a:0{width}b}}
            = 
0b{(~a) & mask :0{width}b}}",
        a = a,
        width = width,
    );
}
```
