The error occurs because of incorrect usage of special characters `<s` for commenting out lines, which is not supported in Go language as it has its own way of comments (// or /* */).

Here's the corrected version of your Golang code:

```go
package main

import  "fmt"

func printLogic(a, b bool) {
	fmt.Println("a && b is", a && b)
   fmt.Println("a || b is", a || b)
   fmt.Println("!a is", !a)
}
```
This code will correctly print the "and", "or" and "not" results for boolean values of `a` and `b`, following Go's standard logical operators usage (`&&` for AND, `||` for OR, `!` for NOT). The commenting syntax has also been corrected to be consistent with Golang conventions.
