The error is that the Rust compiler requires a `main` function to be present in the code, but the converted JavaScript code does not include one. The fix is simply to add a `fn main() {}` function at the end of the code to satisfy the Rust compiler's requirements.

Here's the corrected code:
```rs
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
fn main() {}
```
