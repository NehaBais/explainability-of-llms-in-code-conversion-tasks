The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the header file for `ActiveXObject` and its associated functions, `_access()`. To fix this issue, we need to include the appropriate header files and link against the necessary libraries.
Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
int main() {
  bool fso_fileexists_1 = (0 != _access("input.txt", 0));
  bool fso_fileexists_2 = (0 != _access("c:/input.txt", 0));
  bool fso_folderexists_1 = (0 != _access("docs", 0));
  bool fso_folderexists_2 = (0 != _access("c:/docs", 0));
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
- Include the header file for `ActiveXObject` and its associated functions, `windows.h`, at the beginning of the program using `#include `.
- Link against the necessary library, `libc`, in the compiler options to provide access to the `_access()` function. This can be done by adding `-lc` to the compile command line or by including the `-l` flag followed by `c` in the code itself, like this: `#include  -lc`.
