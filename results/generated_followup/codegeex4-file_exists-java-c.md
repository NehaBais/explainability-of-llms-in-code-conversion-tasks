The error occurs because `access` and `F_OK` are not declared in the included headers. The fix involves including the correct header, `<unistd.h>`, at the top of the file.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  // Check for docs/input.txt in current working directory
  if (access("./docs/input.txt", F_OK) != -1)
    printf("File exists in the current working directory.\n");
  else
    printf("File does not exist in the current working directory.\n");

  // Check for docs/input.txt in root directory
  if (access("/docs/input.txt", F_OK) != -1)
    printf("File exists in the filesystem root.\n");
  else
    printf("File does not exist in the filesystem root.\n");

  return 0;
}
```
