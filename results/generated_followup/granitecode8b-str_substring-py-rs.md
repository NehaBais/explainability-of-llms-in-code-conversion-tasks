The error message indicates that there are two occurrences of `iny` in the code, but there is no variable named `iny`. The code should be corrected to use `m` instead of `iny` in both occurrences. Here's the corrected code:
```rs
fn main() {
    let s = "abcdefgh";
    let n = 2;
    let m = 3;
    let char = 'd';
    let chars = "cd";

    // starting from n=2 characters in and m=3 in length;
    println!("{}", &s[n - 1..n + m - 1]);

    // starting from n characters in, up to the end of the string;
    println!("{}", &s[n - 1..]);

    // whole string minus last character;
    println!("{}", &s[..s.len() - 1]);

    // starting from a known character char="d" within the string and of m length;
    let indx = s.find(char).unwrap();
    println!("{}", &s[indx..indx + m]);

    // starting from a known substring chars="cd" within the string and of m length.
    let indx = s.find(chars).unwrap();
    println!("{}", &s[indx..indx + m]);
}
```
