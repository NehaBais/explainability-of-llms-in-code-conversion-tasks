The error occurs because Rust does not allow keywords like `let` outside of a module or function definition.
To fix it, simply move the declaration of the variable to the top level of the file or inside a function definition.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut string = String::from("def");
    string = format!("{}{}", "abc", string);
}
```
