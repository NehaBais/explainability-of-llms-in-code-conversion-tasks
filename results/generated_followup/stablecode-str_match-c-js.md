The error `Unexpected token ')` is caused by an extra closing parenthesis `)` at the end of a statement. This issue was highlighted during syntax checking of JavaScript code enclosed in backticks.

To fix this issue, remove the extra closing parenthesis `)` from the JavaScript code. The corrected code block should look like this:

```javascript
function substr_index(s, searchString) 
{
    var pos = s.indexOf(searchString);

    if (pos === -1) return 0; // if no match is found

    return pos + 1; // return position of match plus one for JavaScript's zero-based index
}
```
