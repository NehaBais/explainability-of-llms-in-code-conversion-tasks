The issue with the provided Python code is that it has incorrect indentation. When the `if` statement is encountered, it expects an indented block after it, but it doesn't have any. To fix this, you can simply add a tab character before the print statements. Here's the corrected code in a single line:
```py
import os
# Verify file exists in current working directory
if not os.path.isfile("input.txt"):
 print("File input.txt does not exist.")
 # Verify file exists in /root/docs directory
 if not os.path.isfile("/root/docs/input.txt"):
 print("File input.txt does not exist in /root/docs directory.")
# Verify folder exists in current working directory
if not os.path.isdir("docs"):
 print("Folder docs does not exist.")
 # Verify folder exists in /root directory
 if not os.path.isdir("/root/docs"):
 print("Folder docs does not exist in /root directory.")
```
