The error is due to the use of backticks `\`` around the code, which are not recognized as valid syntax by Node.js. The fix is to replace the backticks with a single quote `'` or double quote `"`. Here's an example corrected code:
```
const ball = 'ball';
const bell = 'bell';

console.log(`${ball} ${STREQ(ball,bell)}`);
console.log(`${bell} ${STRNE(ball,bell)}`);
console.log(`${ball} ${STRLT(ball,bell)}`);
console.log(`${bell} ${STRGT(ball,bell)}`);
console.log(`${ball} ${STRGE(ball,bell)}`);
console.log(`${bell} ${STRLE(ball,bell)}`);
```
