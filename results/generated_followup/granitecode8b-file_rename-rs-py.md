The error message indicates that there is an issue with the indentation of the `try` statement on line 4. In Python, indentation is used to define the scope of code blocks, and it must be consistent throughout the code. The error occurs because the `try` statement is not indented properly, which causes the code to raise an IndentationError.
To fix this issue, you need to ensure that all lines within a code block are properly indented. In this case, the `try` statement should be indented by 4 spaces (or one tab) to match the indentation of the surrounding `try-except` block.
Here's the corrected Python code:
```py
import os
def rename_file():
 err = "File move error"
 try:
 os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
 except OSError as e:
 print(err)
try:
 os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
except OSError as e:
 print(err)
try:
 os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
except OSError as e:
 print(err)
try:
 os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
except OSError as e:
 print(err)
```
Note that the `import os` statement is already at the top of the file, so it does not need to be indented. Additionally, the `def rename_file():` line is also not indented, as it is a function definition and should not be part of any code block.
