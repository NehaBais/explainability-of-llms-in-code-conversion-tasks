The error indicates that the compiler cannot find the `iostream` library, which is required for input-output operations in C++. To resolve this, you need to include the standard input/output library by adding the `#include <iostream>` at the beginning of your C++ file.

The corrected code can be written as follows:

```c
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::string original = "Mary had a X lamb";
  std::string little = "little";

  // Using std::stringstream for basic string manipulation
  std::stringstream ss;
  ss << original;
  ss << " " << little;

  std::string replaced = ss.str();

  // Output the result
  std::cout << replaced << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This code now includes the `iostream` library, which allows it to perform input and output operations. The rest of the program remains the same as the JavaScript example.
