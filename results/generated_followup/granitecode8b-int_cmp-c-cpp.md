The error in the given code is that it uses C-style input/output functions (`scanf` and `printf`) instead of C++-style input/output functions (`cin` and `cout`). The fix for this error is to replace all instances of `scanf` with `cin` and all instances of `printf` with `cout`.
Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include
using namespace std;
int main() {
 int a, b;
 cout << "Enter two integers: ";
 cin >> a >> b;

 if (a < b) {
 cout << a << " is less than " << b << endl;
 }

 if (a == b) {
 cout << a << " is equal to " << b << endl;
 }

 if (a > b) {
 cout << a << " is greater than " << b << endl;
 }

 return 0;
}
```
This code uses the `iostream` library and C++-style input/output functions (`cin` and `cout`) to prompt the user for two integers, compare them using the `<`, `==`, and `>` operators, and display a message based on the comparison result. The output will be displayed in the terminal.
