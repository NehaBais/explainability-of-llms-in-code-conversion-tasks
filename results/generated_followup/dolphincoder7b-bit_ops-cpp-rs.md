The error occurs because Rust does not have a logical right shift (`>>` operator) or rotate operations (`.rotate_left()` and `.rotate_right()`) in its standard library. These functions are only available in the nightly Rust compiler. To fix this issue, you can use the bit-manipulation functions available in the `std::intrinsics` module. The code should look like this:
```rust
use std::num::Wrapping;
use std::intrinsics::{shift_left, shift_right};  // Import necessary intrinsics

fn bitwise(mut a: i32, mut b: i32) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a & b);  // Note: parentheses are needed because & has lower precedence than <<
    println!("a or b:   {}", a | b);
    println!("a xor b:  {}", a ^ b);
    println!("not a:   {}", !a);

    let mut ua = Wrapping(a as u32);
    println!("a shl b:   {}", shift_left(ua, b));  // Note:  "<<" is used both for output and for left shift
    println!("a shr b:   {}", shift_right(ua, b) as i32);  // typically arithmetic right shift, but not guaranteed

    let mut ub = Wrapping(b as u32);
    println!("a lsr b:   {}", ua.shr_exact(ub).0 as i32);  // logical right shift (guaranteed)

    // there are no rotation operators in Rust, but as of Rust 1.56 there is a standard-library rotate function.
     // The rotate function works for all rotation amounts, but the integer being rotated must always be an
     // unsigned integer.
    println!("a rol b:   {}", (a.rotate_left(b as u32) as i32));
    println!("a ror b:   {}", (a.rotate_right(b as u32) as i32));
}
```

This code fixes the issues by adding import statements for the necessary intrinsics and using them in place of `<<`, `>>`, `.shr_exact()`, etc., which are unavailable without nightly Rust. The `shift_*` functions handle bit-shifting operations, while the `rotate_*` functions handle rotation operations. The `Wrapping(a as u32)` conversion is needed to rotate signed integers in Rust.
