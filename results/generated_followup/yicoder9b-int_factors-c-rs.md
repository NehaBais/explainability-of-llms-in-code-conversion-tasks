The error is caused by Rust's ownership rules, which requires specifying how long each borrowed reference (`&`) holds onto the value it is referencing. The function `xferFactors` returns a mutable reference to `fctrs` but this function signature doesn't specify from whose lifetime the borrow comes hence the error.

The fix involves introducing a named lifetime parameter which specifies that both `fctrs` and `flist` are borrowing from the same lifetime.

Here is the corrected code:
```rs
use std::vec::Vec;

struct Factors {
    list: Vec<i32>,
    count: usize,
}

fn xferFactors<'a>(fctrs: &'a mut Factors, flist: &'a [i32], flix: i32) -> &'a mut Factors {
... } // code for the function `xferFactors`
```
