The error message `runtime.main_mainÂ·f: function main is undeclared in the main package` indicates that Go compiler has not recognized `func main()` as the entry point to run a program. 

This can be corrected by declaring `func main()` at the beginning of the code, which will serve as an entry point for your application. After fixing it, here is the corrected code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func logic(a bool, b bool) {
	fmt.Println("a && b:", a && b) // and operation
	fmt.Println("a || b:", a || b) // or operation
	fmt.Println("!a:", !a)         // not operation
}

func main() {
	logic(true, false) 
}
```
In this code, we defined our function `logic` as the previous Python version did in Go. Then we call that function inside of a new function called `main` which is the entry point for any Go application. For simplicity, it's calling `logic()` with two boolean arguments: true and false.
