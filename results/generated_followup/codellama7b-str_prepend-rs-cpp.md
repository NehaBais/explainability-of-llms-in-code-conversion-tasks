Error: The errors are due to the use of C++ standard library functions (`std::string`, `std::insert`, `std::cout`) which are not declared in the code.

Fix: To fix the error, you need to include the header file for the standard library (`<iostream>` and `<string>`). The corrected code should look like this:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string s("World");
    s.insert(0, "Hello ");
    std::cout << s << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Corrected code: The corrected code includes the necessary header files and uses the standard library functions to create a string variable, insert a string literal at the beginning of the string, and print the resulting string to the console using `std::cout`.
