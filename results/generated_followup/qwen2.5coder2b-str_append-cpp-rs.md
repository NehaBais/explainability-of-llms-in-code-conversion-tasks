The error is because Rust does not allow dots (.) to appear in the crate name. The solution is to add `#![crate_name="qwen2_5coder2b_str_append_rust"]` at the top of the file. Here's the corrected and single code block:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut greeting = String::from("Hello") ;
    greeting.push_str(", world!"); 
    println!("{}", greeting);
}
```
