The error is that the C++ compiler cannot find the standard header files `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<cassert>`. The fix is to add the appropriate include statements at the beginning of the file.
Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;
vector factor(int num) {
  vector factors; // creates a new vector for the factors of the number

  for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(num); i++) {
    if (num % i == 0) {
      factors.push_back(i); // pushes smallest factor to vector
      factors.push_back(num / i); // pushes largest factor to vector
    }
  }
  sort(factors.begin(), factors.end()); // sorts the factors into numerical order
  return factors; // returns the vector of factors
}
int main() {
  vector expected = {1,  2,  4,  5,  10, 10}; // creates a vector to hold expected values
  vector actual = factor(50); // calculates the factors of 50 and stores them in a vector
  assert(actual == expected); // checks if the calculated factors match the expected values
  return 0;
}
```
