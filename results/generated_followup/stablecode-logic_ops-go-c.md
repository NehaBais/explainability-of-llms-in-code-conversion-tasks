The error: "Undefined symbols for architecture arm64" typically occurs when there's an issue with the linker commands or project settings. To fix this error, ensure that you have properly linked all required libraries, and that your project settings are correctly configured to support the ARM64 architecture (if applicable)).

Here is the corrected code in a single fenced code block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void printLogic(int a, int b) {
  printf("a and b is %d\n", a && b);
  printf("a or b is %d\n", a || b);
  printf("not a is %d\n", !a);
}
```
