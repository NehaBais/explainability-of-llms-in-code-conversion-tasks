The error is that Python does not support backticks for multi-line statements. The `format()` function requires multi-line strings, so it cannot be used with single-line backticks. To fix this, we can use triple quotes (`"""`) instead. Here's the corrected code:
```py
str = """Mary had a {} lamb"""
txt = "little"
out = str.format(txt)
print(out)
```
This should work as expected.
