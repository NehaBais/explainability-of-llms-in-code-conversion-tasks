 The error is occurring because Rust requires a main function as an entry point to the program. In this context, the 'main' function can be defined at any level of indentation in the source file.

To fix the error, simply add a 'main' function that calls the 'logic' function:

```rs
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a || b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);
}

fn main() {
    logic(true, false);
}
```
In the 'main' function, we can call our 'logic' function with some boolean arguments. You may replace `(true, false)` with your own values for testing. This code will print out the results of performing "and" and "or" operations on 'a' and 'b', as well as performing the "not" operation on 'a'.
