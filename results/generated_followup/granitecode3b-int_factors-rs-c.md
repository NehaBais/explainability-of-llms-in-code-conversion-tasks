The error in the provided C code is that it tries to compare two objects of different types, which is not allowed by the C standard. The first error occurs on lines 6 and 12, where `assert` and `factor` are called with incompatible data types. The second error occurs on line 6, where `memcpy` is called with incompatible data types.
To fix this, we need to make sure that all objects being passed to `assert`, `factor`, and `Memcpy` are of the same type. One way to do this is to declare the function's return type as a pointer to an array of integers (`int *`) and pass it by reference to `assert` and `factor`. The data type of the arguments can be specified using the `sizeof` operator in C.
Here's the corrected code:
```c
int *factor(int num) {
  int i, sqrt_num = (int)sqrt((float)num);
  int *factors = malloc(
      sizeof(int) * (1 + num)); // Add one more element for the null terminator

  // Rest of the function...

  return factors;
}
```
