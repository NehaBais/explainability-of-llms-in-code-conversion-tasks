The error occurred because the `DirBuilder` import was unused in the script, which is why it gave a warning. The absence of the `main` function caused Rust to throw an error as the entry point for a binary crate is required.

To fix this, remove the unused import and define the `main` function to call our `mkdirp` function with a sample path. This way we provide an entry point to the program:

```rust
fn main() {
    let result = mkdirp("./path/to/dir");
    match result {
        Ok(_) => println!("Directory created successfully"),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error creating directory: {}", e),
    }
}
```

This corrected code defines the `main` function to call `mkdirp` with a sample path, and handle any potential errors that might occur.
