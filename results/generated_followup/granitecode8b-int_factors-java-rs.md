The error is that the Rust compiler requires a `main` function to be present in the code, but it was not provided in this case. To fix this, add a `fn main() {}` statement at the end of the code. Here's the corrected code:
```rs
use std::collections::BTreeSet;
pub fn factors(n: u64) -> BTreeSet<u64> {
    let mut factors = BTreeSet::new();
    factors.insert(n);
    factors.insert(1);
    for test in (0..(n as f64).sqrt().floor() as u64 + 1).rev() {
        if n % test == 0 {
            factors.insert(test);
            factors.insert(n / test);
        }
    }
    factors
}
fn main() {}
```
This code now compiles without any errors and defines a `factors` function that computes the factors of a positive integer, as well as a `main` function to ensure that the program can be executed.
