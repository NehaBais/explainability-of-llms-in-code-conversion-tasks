The error in the C code is that it tries to call an undeclared function `printf`. To fix this, you need to include the header file `<stdio.h>` or provide a declaration for `printf` explicitly.
Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include 
int main() {
  unsigned char a = 105;
  unsigned char b = 91;
  printf("a      = %08b n", a);
  printf("b      = %08b n", b);
  printf("a | b  = %08b n", a | b);
  printf("a & b  = %08b n", a & b);
  printf("a ^ b  = %08b n", a ^ b);
  printf("!a     = %08b n", !a);
  printf("a << 3 = %08b n", a << 3);
  printf("a >> 3 = %08b n", a >> 3);
}
```
The error is that the compiler cannot find the function `printf`, so it must be declared or provided elsewhere. The fix is to include the header file `<stdio.h>` and declare `printf` explicitly with the correct type signature.
