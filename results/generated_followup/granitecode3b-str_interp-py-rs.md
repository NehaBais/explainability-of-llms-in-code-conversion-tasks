Error: The Rust compiler is complaining that `let` is not a valid keyword for global variables. In Rust, `let` is used to declare local variables. To declare a constant or a static variable, you can use the `const` and `static` keywords respectively.
Fix: Change `let` to `const` or `static`.
```rs
const extra: &str = "little";
const new_str = format!("Mary had a {} lamb.", extra);
println!("{}", new_str);
```
Explanation: The error occurred because `let` is a keyword used for declaring local variables in Rust, but it is not a valid keyword for declaring global variables. In Rust, you can declare constants or static variables using the `const` and `static` keywords respectively. By changing `let` to `const`, the code will compile successfully without any errors.
