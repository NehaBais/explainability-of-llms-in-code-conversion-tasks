The error is caused by using `os.path<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>()` which seems to be an invalid syntax. The proper way to check if the directory already exists is with `os.path.isdir(path)`. 

The fix is replacing `os.path<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>()` with `os.path.isdir(path)` in the code block.

Here's the corrected Python function:
```python
import os
import errno

def mkdirp(path):
    try:
        os.makedirs(path)
    except OSError as e:
        # If the error was because the last folder didn't exist, return. 
        if e.errno == errno.EEXIST and os.path.isdir(path):
            pass
        else:
            raise
```
