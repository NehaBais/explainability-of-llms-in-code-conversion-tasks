The error message is indicating that the `os` package is undefined, meaning it cannot be found by the Go compiler. This is likely due to the fact that the code is not importing the `os` package, which is necessary for using file system operations in Go.

To fix the issue, you can import the `os` package at the top of your file like this:
```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"
)
```
This will allow the code to compile and run successfully.
