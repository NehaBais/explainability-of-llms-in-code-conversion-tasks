The error occurs because there is no main function in the given JavaScript code that is being converted to C++. To solve this issue, add the main function at the beginning of your program.

This way, the linker will be able to find and link with the necessary main function from the standard library. 

The corrected code is shown below:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  void logic(bool a, bool b); // Declaration of the logic function
  return 0;
}
void logic(bool a, bool b) {
  std::cout << "a AND b:   " << (a && b);
  std::cout << "\na OR b:    " << (a || b);
  std::cout << "\nNOT a:    " << (!a);
}
```
This will work when you compile the code in an environment that supports C++.
