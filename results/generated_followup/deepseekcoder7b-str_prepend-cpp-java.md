The error occurs because of incorrect usage of backticks ``, which were used to denote multi-line code. In Java, this does not apply here as we cannot use them for multiline string representation in Java. Instead, the whole program is enclosed inside double quotes `"` in one line and processed by Java compiler.

The fix is to remove the backticks (``) around the entire block of code:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)  {
        ArrayList<String> myStrings = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("prepended to", "my string"));
        
        StringBuilder prepended = new StringBuilder();
        for (String str : myStrings) {
            prepended.insert(0, str);   // This line is equivalent to your C++ std::accumulate function
        }
      
        System.out.println(prepended.toString());
    }
}
``` 

This corrected code should work as expected without any syntax error. It concatenates all strings in the array list `myStrings` and prepends them to a new string builder, which is then printed out.
