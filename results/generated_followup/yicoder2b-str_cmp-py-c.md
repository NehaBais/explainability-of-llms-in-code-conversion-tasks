This problem seems to be related to C language and Python language respectively. Since we do not have the actual code we are supposed to convert or provide exact solutions, it would be difficult for us to solve this. However, I can suggest a general approach for each of them:

1. For Python:
Python has built-in functions like `type()` which gives information about variable types in python. But C language does not have such function to determine the type of a variable directly. We have to use functions like `__typeof__(x)` to get the type of a variable dynamically, but this only works in C11 and later.

2. For C:
In C language, we directly compare numeric strings using their numerical values if they are not treated lexically by the C language. However, for non-numeric strings like 'YUP' and 'BELL', we need to use the `strcmp` function provided in the library which is used for string comparisons in C language. 

For example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
    char *a = "24"; // Numeric string
    char *b = "123"; // Numeric string
    if (strcmp(a, b) < 0) printf("%s is strictly less than  %s\n", a, b);
    else if (strcmp(a, b) == 0) printf("%s is less than or equal to %s\n", a, b);
    // The similar lines of codes can be written for all the cases.
}
```
Note that the `strcmp` function returns a negative value if the first string is smaller than the second string (lexical comparison), 0 if they are equal and a positive value otherwise.
