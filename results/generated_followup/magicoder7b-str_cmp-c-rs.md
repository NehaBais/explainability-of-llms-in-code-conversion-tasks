 The error is because Rust does not have methods like `ge_ignore_ascii_case`, `le_ignore_ascii_case` or `lt_ignore_ascii_case` for string comparison in the standard library. There are only few comparison methods available, as stated above.

The fix would be to use the correct method for string comparison: 
```rs
fn compare(a: &str, b: &str) {
    println!(
        "{} {} {} {} {} {} {}",
        a,
        a == b,
        a != b,
        a > b,
        a < b,
        a >= b,
        a <= b,
    );
}
```

This correctly compares the strings and provides boolean results for the different comparison scenarios.
