Your request cannot be completed because the Rust programming language does not allow renaming files or directories at filesystem root level. The `rename()` function in Rust takes two paths as arguments: a source and a destination, not paths to directories in different filesystem roots.

Additionally, Rust does not have a concept of "current working directory" like Bash or Windows command prompt. If you attempt to use `set_current_dir` on the root directory (which is usually '/'), it will fail because there are no more directories to switch into at this point.

To solve your problem in Rust, you would need to move your current working directory to the root filesystem before attempting to rename any file or directory there.

Here's an example of how you might do that:
```rust
extern crate super::fs; // This will be able to call the filesystem methods on fs crate (or standard library)
use std::env;
fn main() {
    let err = "File move error";
    if let Some(root_path) = env::var("HOME"){
        if let Ok(_) = std::fs::set_current_dir(root_path) {
            match (std::fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt"), 
                   std::fs::rename("docs", "mydocs")){
                Ok((src1, dst1)) => println!("Successfully renamed {} to {}", src1, dst1),
                Err(_e) => (),
            }?;
        } else {
            println!("Cannot change directories.");
        }
    }else{
        println!("Cannot find HOME environment variable. Cannot proceed to the root directory.");
    }
}
``` 
Please note that if your operating system doesn't support this kind of operations, the Rust program may fail or print an error message.
