The error occurs because `factors` is defined as a pointer to `long`, but it's being used here as if it were a function that returns a pointer to `long`. The fix is to pass the address of `size` to the function, which makes `size` an lvalue, and can thus be assigned. Here is the corrected code:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void factors(long n, long **factors, int *size) {
  long sqrt_n = (long)sqrt(n);
  *size =
      2 + (sqrt_n -
           1); // Initialize the size of the array with a reasonable estimate.
  *factors = malloc(sizeof(long) * (*size));
  if (!*factors)
    return; // Check for allocation failure.

  (*factors)[0] = n;
  (*factors)[1] = 1L;
  int i, j;

  for (i = n - 1; i >= sqrt_n; i--) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
      (*factors)[j++] = i;
      (*factors)[j++] = n / i;
    }
  }

  *size = j; // Update the size of array to the actual number of factors found.
}

int main() {
  int size;
  long *factors;
  factors(n, &factors, &size);

  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    printf("%ld ", factors[i]);
  }

  free(factors); // Don't forget to free the allocated memory.

  return 0;
}
```

In this version of the code, the function `factors` now takes three arguments: a long integer `n`, a pointer to a pointer to a long (`long **factors`), and an int pointer (`int *size`). The function allocates memory for the factors array and assigns it to the location pointed by `factors`. It then fills up this array with all of the factors of `n`, updating `*size` as it goes.
