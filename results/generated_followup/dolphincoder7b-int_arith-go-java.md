The error occurs because Golang requires a class, interface, or enum at the beginning of the file to define what type of program it is. This requirement does not apply to Java, which can start with comments or whitespace.

To fix this, we need to add a comment to explain that this is a placeholder for a real Java program. Here's the corrected code:
```java
// GET A AND B AS INTEGERS FROM THE USER
// DISPLAY "enter two integers:"
// READ IN A AND B
// DISPLAY (A  + B) AS INTEGER
// DISPLAY (A  - B) AS INTEGER
// DISPLAY (A  * B) AS INTEGER
// DISPLAY (A  / B) AS INTEGER
// DISPLAY (A  % B) AS INTEGER
```
