The error is that the compiler cannot find the `iostream` header file or the `cout` object. The fix is to include the header file `iostream` at the beginning of the program and declare the `cout` object before using it.
```c++
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::string s1 = "Hello";
    std::string s2 = "World";
    std::cout << (s1 == s2) << std::endl; // Output: 0
    return 0;
}
```
