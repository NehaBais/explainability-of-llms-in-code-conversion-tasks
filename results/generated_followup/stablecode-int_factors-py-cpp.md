The error is caused by an extraneous closing brace (`}`)) on line 34, which does not match any opening brace (`{`))) on lines 27-29.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the extraneous closing brace from line 34.

Here is the corrected code block:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
int main() 
{
    for (const auto& i: {45, 53, 64}}) 
    {
        factor(i);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
