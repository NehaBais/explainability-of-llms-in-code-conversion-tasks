 The error occurred because `fmt.Sprint()` expects a variadic argument of type `any`, but `[]string` is passed instead. To fix this, we need to convert each string in the slice to an interface using type assertion or conversion (`interface{}`), which can be done with `...` operator after converting the slice to an array.

Here's the corrected code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	s1 := "hello"
	fmt.Println(s1 + " world")

	s2 := s1 + " world"
	fmt.Println(s2)

	// Correcting the join operation by converting each string in the slice to interface{}
	parts := []string{s1, "world", "mom"}
	result := fmt.Sprint([]interface{}(parts)...)
	fmt.Println(result)

	s2 = s1 + ", " + "world" + ", " + "mom"
	fmt.Println(s2)
}
```

This code correctly converts the slice to an array of interfaces and passes it as a variadic argument to `fmt.Sprint()`, allowing for proper string concatenation.
