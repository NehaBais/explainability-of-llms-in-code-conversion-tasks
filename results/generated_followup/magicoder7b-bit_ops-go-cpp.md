 The error message indicates that there is an issue with the way C++ compiler interprets the cast from int to short. In C++, for casting like this, we usually use static_cast or dynamic_cast. 

Here's how you can fix the problem:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void bitwise(int a, int b) {
  cout << "a:   " << bitset<16>(static_cast<unsigned short>(a)) << endl;
  cout << "b:   " << bitset<16>(static_cast<unsigned short>(b)) << endl;

  // Bitwise logical operations
  unsigned short result = static_cast<unsigned short>(a) & b;
  cout << "and: " << bitset<16>(result) << endl;
  
  ... 

}
```

In this fix, I have used `static_cast` to cast an integer to a short. The issue was that the original code was treating 'a' as an int and trying to do a conversion in one go, whereas C++ requires that you first convert 'a' to an unsigned short before doing the bitwise operation with it.
