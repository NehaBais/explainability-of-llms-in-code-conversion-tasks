The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the `<experimental/filesystem>` header file, which is part of C++'s Standard Library for filesystem-related operations. 

This typically happens when you try to compile a program using the experimental C++17 feature in an environment where itâ€™s not supported or enabled by default (like some online compilers). In these cases, you would need to enable the `std=c++17` flag while compiling your code.

The corrected single-codeblock solution is:

```cpp
#include <experimental/filesystem>
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
int main() { 
    for(auto& p : std::vector<std::string>{"input.txt", "docs"}){
        if (fs::exists(p)) {
            if (fs::is_directory(p)) 
                printf("\"%s\" is a directory\n", p.c_str());
            else 
                printf("\"%s\" is a file\n", p.c_str());
        }
        else 
            printf("\"%s\" does not exist\n", p.c_str());
    }
}
```

This code will verify if files named "input.txt" and "docs" (without slashes indicating absolute path) exist in the current working directory, printing out whether they are directories or files respectively, or stating that they don't exist if they do not. 

Please note to compile this C++17 code with a C++ compiler which supports C++17 standards using `-std=c++17` flag while compiling the file (like g++ for example).

If you are still having issues with your compiler setup, kindly provide more information about what kind of compiler and version you're using so that I could give a better help.
