Error: Expected item, found keyword `let`.
Fix: Remove `let` keyword from the beginning of the first line.
```rust
mut s = String::from("world!");
s = "Hello, ".to_string() + &s;
```
Explanation: 
The error occurs because the Rust compiler is expecting an item to be defined on the first line of a module or function, but it finds a keyword instead. In this case, `let` is a keyword and not a valid item name, so the Rust compiler throws an error. 
To fix this, we simply remove the `let` keyword from the beginning of the first line. This tells the Rust compiler to expect the next item on the same line.
