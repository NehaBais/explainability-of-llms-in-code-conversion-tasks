Fix explanation:
The error is caused by the incorrect usage of the double equal (`==`) operator in the code block at line 43. The double equal operator was used incorrectly, resulting in an extraneous `)` after condition error.
To fix this issue, we need to replace the incorrect usage of the double equal operator with a single equal (`==`) operator. This will ensure that both strings are compared for equality before the comparison is made within the `if` statement block at line 43.
Corrected code:
```cpp
std::string str1 = "Hello";
std::string str2 = "World";
// The corrected code uses a single equal (`==`) operator to compare both strings for equality before the comparison is made within the if statement block at line 43.
if (str1 == str2) {
    std::cout << "The strings are equal." << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "The strings are not equal." << std::endl;
}
```
