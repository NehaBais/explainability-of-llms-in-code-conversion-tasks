The error message indicates that `DirBuilder` does not implement trait `Try`, which is required for handling errors with the `?` operator. The fix can be to use `unwrap()` instead of `set_permisions(0o755)` which simply ignores any error and returns an `Err` value if it occurs.

Corrected code:
```rs
use std::fs;
use std::io::Result;

fn create(directory: &str) -> Result<()> {
    fs::File::create(format!("{}/output.txt", directory))?;
    fs::DirBuilder::new().build(format!("{}/docs", directory))?;
    Ok(())
}

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    create(".")?;  // current directory
  
    /* The root directory is not universally supported on all systems due to security reasons.
       Thus, it's recommended to avoid using the root directory in general use cases and handle this edge case manually */
    
    Ok(())
}
```
