The error message indicates that Rust expects an identifier (a variable, function or constant name) after `fn` instead of a keyword. However, keywords are not allowed to be used as identifiers in Rust. 

To fix this issue, we need to escape the reserved keyword `fn`. We do this by adding an `#` symbol before the keyword, which tells the compiler to treat the keyword as a literal string and not as a keyword. This means that `fn` will no longer be treated as a keyword in Rust but instead will appear as the literal string "fn".

Additionally, we also need to escape the reserved keyword `Ok`, as it is also used as an identifier in Rust. We use `#Ok` to indicate that this should be treated as a literal string.

Here's how you'd fix and rewrite the code:
```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn main()  {
    create_file("input.txt");
    create_file("/input.txt");
    create_dir("docs");
    create_dir("/docs");
}

fn create_file(r#fn: &str) {
    match fs::File::create(&Path::new(r#fn))  {
        Ok(_) => println!("file {} created!", r#fn),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("{}", e),
     }
}

fn create_dir(dn: &str)  {
    match fs::create_dir(&Path::new(dn))  {
        Ok(_) => println!("directory {} created!", dn),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("{}", e),
     }
}
```
