**Error:** The error occurs because the variable declaration `s1 := "Hello"` is outside the package declaration.

**Fix:** Move the variable declaration inside the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.

**Corrected Code:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s1 := "Hello"
	s1 += ", World!"
	fmt.Println(s1)
}
```
