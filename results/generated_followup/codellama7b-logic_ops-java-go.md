The error occurred because the Go compiler expected to see a `package` statement at the beginning of the file, but instead found a `func` declaration. This is because in Go, functions must be declared within a package.

To fix the error, we need to add a `package` statement at the beginning of the file, like this:
```go
package main

func logic(a, b bool) {
	fmt.Println("a AND b:", a && b)
	fmt.Println("a OR b:", a || b)
	fmt.Println("NOT a:", !a)
}
```
This will tell the Go compiler that we are declaring a function within the `main` package, and it can then proceed to compile the code successfully.
