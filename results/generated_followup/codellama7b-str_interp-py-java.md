Error: The error is due to the use of an implicitly declared class, which is a preview feature that is disabled by default in Java.

Fix: To fix this issue, you need to enable the implicit declaration of classes using the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling your code.

Rewritten Code:
```java
String extra = "little";
String newStr = String.format("Mary had a %s lamb.", extra);
System.out.println(newStr);
```
