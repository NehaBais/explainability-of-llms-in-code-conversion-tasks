This error arises due to incorrect usage of built-in operations, such as division or exponentiation. Rust does not have built-in subtraction, addition, multiplication, division, modulus, or power operators. So, you cannot perform arithmetic operations like subtraction (`-`) and addition (`+`) in this context.

Here is the corrected code:

```rust
let input1 = 4;
let input2 = -3; // if `input2` should be positive
let mut quotient: f64 = ((*input1 as f64 / *input2 as f64).abs() - (input1 as i32 - input2 as i32)).into() as f64;
```
This code first calculates the absolute difference between `input1` and `input2`. Then it performs subtraction on the result and `input2`, while converting the integer types to a floating-point type (f64 in this case). It will give you an error when `input2` is negative as Rust doesn't allow negative arithmetic with floating point numbers.

If you want to perform basic operations like addition or multiplication, you should import the corresponding functions from the standard library or provide your own implementations.
