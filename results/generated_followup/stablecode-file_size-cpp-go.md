The error in the provided code is related to syntax errors in multiple places of the code. 

To fix these syntax errors, we can make the following changes:

1. Replace `#include` with `package main`.
2. Replace `std::exception` with `errors.New("")`, where you provide a meaningful error message.
3. Change `try {...} catch (const std::exception& ex) {...}}` to `err := ...`.
4. Update the line `fmt.Printf(...)` to `fmt.Printf(...)`, where you provide the desired format and values for printing.
5. Replace `print_file_size` with a meaningful name, such as `getFileSize`.
6. Update `print_file_size("input.txt")` to `printFileSize("input.txt")`, where you replace the filename "input.txt" with the desired file path and/or filename.
7. Update `printFileSize("/input.txt")` to `printFileSize("/input.txt")`, where you provide the file path "/input.txt", which represents the directory of the root file system.
8. Remove unnecessary lines or code blocks that are not required for the desired functionality.
9. Ensure that all variables and function names used in the code are unique within the context of the code.
10. Add necessary import statements to ensure that all required packages, functions, and types are available for use in the code.
11. Ensure that the entire code is properly indented and formatted according to Golang's style guidelines.
12. Ensure that the code does not contain any potential security risks or vulnerabilities.
13. Verify that the code compiles without errors and produces the desired output, if applicable.
14. If necessary, modify the code further to address specific requirements or constraints.
15. Finally, ensure that you provide meaningful error messages and explanations for any issues or errors encountered during the testing of the Golang code.

Here's the fixed Golang code:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
)

func printFileSize(filename string) {
	fileInfo, err := os.Stat(filename)

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error occurred:", err)
		return
	}

	size := fileInfo.Size()

	fmt.Printf("Size of file %s is %d bytes.\n", filename, size))
}

func main() {
	printFileSize("input.txt")

	if _, err := os.Stat("/input.txt"); !os.IsNotExist(err) {
		fmt.Println("Error occurred:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("Size of file /input.txt is %d bytes.\n", size))
}
```

The fixed code includes the necessary import statements, proper indentation and formatting according to Golang's style guidelines, and meaningful error messages for any issues or errors encountered during the testing of the code.
