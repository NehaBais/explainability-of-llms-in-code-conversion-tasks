The error message indicates that there are several issues with the code, including invalid use of keywords as identifiers, no method named `is` found for reference `&str`, and expected identifier, found keyword `type`.

To fix these errors, we need to:

1. Use escape characters to avoid treating keywords as identifiers in the `println!` statements. For example, use `r#type` instead of just `type` to refer to the `type` method on a reference to a string.
2. Replace `is` with `eq` or `ne` methods to compare references to strings for equality or inequality.
3. Use the `type_id` method on references to strings to get their type IDs, instead of using the `is` method.
4. Remove the parentheses around the `a.type_id()` and `b.type_id()` in the `println!` statement.
5. Replace the parentheses around `a.is(b)` and `!a.is(b)` with square brackets to compare references for equality or inequality using the `eq` or `ne` methods, respectively.

Corrected code:
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = "hello";
    let b = "world";
    
    println!("{} is of type {} and {} is of type {}", a, a.type_id(), b, b.type_id());
    if a.eq(b) {
        println!("{} and {} are equal", a, b);
    } else {
        println!("{} and {} are not equal", a, b);
    }
}
```
