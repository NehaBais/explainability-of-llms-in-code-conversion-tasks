Error: `String s = "hello";` is an implicitly declared class, which is a preview feature in Java 17 and later versions. To fix this error, you need to enable the preview feature by adding `--enable-preview` as a compiler argument.
Fix: Add `--enable-preview` as a compiler argument to enable the implicitly declared classes feature.
Rewritten code:
```java
--enable-preview
String s = "hello";
String t = s + " there!";
System.out.println(t);
```
