The error message indicates that there are some unrecognized characters present in your return statement, which is causing issues for the compiler. The expected syntax for returning an integer (0) from a main function in C++ is `return 0;` without any special symbols or characters around it. So the corrected code will be:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::string original = "Mary had a X lamb";
  std::string little = "little";
  size_t pos = 0;
  
  while ((pos = original.find("X", pos)) != std::string::npos) {
    original.replace(pos, 1, little);
    pos += little.length();
  }

  std::cout << "Original: " << original << "\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```
This code works identically to the JavaScript one you provided and will output `Mary had a little lamb` when executed. It finds each occurrence of 'X' in the string `original`, replaces it with the value of `little`, and then outputs the modified string. The return statement is fixed as well to be valid C++ syntax.
