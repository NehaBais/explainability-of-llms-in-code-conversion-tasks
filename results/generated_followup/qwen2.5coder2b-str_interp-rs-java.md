The error is that `System.out.println` method does not have any applicable methods for the arguments passed to it in this case. The Java version of String.format() accepts an array of objects, not multiple parameters.

To fix the error, we need to pass the argument values as an array.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Define variables or values
    String adjective = "little";

    // Print using variable and format method
    System.out.println("Mary had a %s lamb".formatted(adjective));
    System.out.printf("%s had a %s lamb%n", adjective, "Mary");
  }
}
```
