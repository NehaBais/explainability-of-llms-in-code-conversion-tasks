The error in the provided C code is that there is an extraneous `)` before the semicolon (`;`) on line 9. 

To fix this error, we need to remove the extraneous `)`. The corrected code is as follows:

```c
#include 
#include 
int main() 
{
    char s[100];

    strcpy(s, "World");
    strcat(s, "Hello ");
    printf("%s\n", s);

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected code will compile and run successfully. It creates a string variable `s` and initializes it with the text "World". Then, it concatenates the string literal "Hello " to the beginning of `s`. Finally, it prints the resulting string using the `printf` function.
