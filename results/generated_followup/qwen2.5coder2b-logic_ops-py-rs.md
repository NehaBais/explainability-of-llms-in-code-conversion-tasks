The error is caused by Rust's syntax for crate names. Rust requires each crate to have a unique name, including the dot (.) that was present in the Python example.

To fix this, we need to change the `crate_name` attribute in the `main` function to match the new name of the crate, which is `qwen2_5coder2b_logic_ops_rs`.

The corrected code block is as follows:

```rust
#[crate_name = "qwen2_5coder2b_logic_ops_rs"]
fn main() {
    logic(true, true);
}

fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a || b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);
}
```
