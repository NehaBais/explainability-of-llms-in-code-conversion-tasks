The error is a `SyntaxError` caused by an unmatched closing parenthesis ')' on line 7 of the code.

The fix involves correcting the syntax error by adding a matching opening parenthesis '(' before the string "input.txt" in line 7 of the code. This will ensure that the `File` object is correctly initialized with the correct file path.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os

# Get current working directory
current_directory = os.getcwd()

# File paths for different files
fileA_path = os.path.join(current_directory, 'input.txt'))
fileB_path = '/file.txt'

# Get the size of fileA and print it in a formatted way 
fileA_size = os.path.getsize(fileA_path))
print("File A: {} bytes".format(fileA_size))))

# Get the size of fileB and print it in a formatted way 
fileB_size = os.path.getsize(fileB_path))
print("File B: {} bytes".format(fileB_size))))
```

This code ensures that the `File` object is correctly initialized with the correct file paths for files in the current working directory and file system root. It also retrieves and prints the size of both files in a formatted way using the `os.path.getsize()` method to retrieve the size of each file, and the `print()` function to print the size of each file in a formatted way.
