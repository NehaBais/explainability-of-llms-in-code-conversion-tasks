The error is because the Rust compiler requires a `main` function to be present in the crate, but the given code does not have a `main` function. The fix is to add a `fn main() { ... }` function at the end of the code, which will serve as the entry point for the program.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
fn main() {}
```
