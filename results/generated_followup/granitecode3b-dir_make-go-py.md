The issue with the provided Python function is that it does not handle the case where the directory already exists but is not a directory. This is because `os.makedirs()` raises an `OSError` exception when the path already exists, even if it's not a directory. The fix for this issue is to check whether the path already exists and is a directory before attempting to create it, and if so, do nothing.
Here's the corrected Python code:
```py
import os
def mkdir_p(path):
 if os.path.isdir(path):
 pass
 else:
 try:
 os.makedirs(path)
 except OSError as exc:
 if exc.errno == os.errno.EEXIST:
 pass
 else:
 raise
``` 
The entire code is enclosed in a single fenced code block to make it easier to read and understand.
