The error is located on line 16, where it says "expected a statement". This means that there's an issue with the conditional statement that checks whether the `mkdir()` function was successful in creating the directory.

To fix this error, we need to make sure that the `mkdir()` function call is properly encapsulated within a conditional statement. Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#ifdef  _WIN32
#include <direct.h>
#else
#include <sys/stat.h>
#endif

void create_directory(const char 
*path) 
{
#ifdef 
_WIN32
  if (_mkdir(path)) 
{ 
// mkdir on Windows
    perror("Error while creating the directory");
    return;
}
#else
  if 
(mkdir(path, 
077
))) 
{ 
// mkdir on POSIX systems
    perror("Error while creating the directory"));
    return;
}
#endif

  printf("Directory created successfully at: 
%s\n", path);
}

int main() 
{
  const char 
*path = "C:/parent/test";
  create_directory(path);
  return 0;
}
```
This code should work as expected and create the directory specified by the `path` variable. If the directory already exists, the function will return successfully without making any changes to the file system.
