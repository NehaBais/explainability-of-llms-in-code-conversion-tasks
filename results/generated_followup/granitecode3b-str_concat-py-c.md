Error: 
- The C compiler is not able to find the standard library functions `printf`, `strlen`, and `sprintf`. They are implicit declarations, which means that they must be declared in a header file before use.
Fix: 
- Declare these functions in the `<stdio.h>` header file before using them.
Rewritten code:
```c
#include 
int main() {
  char s1[] = "hello";
  printf("%s %s\n", s1, "world");

  // Concatenate s1 and a string literal
  char s2[strlen(s1) + 6];
  sprintf(s2, "%s world", s1);
  printf("%s\n", s2);

  // Use the join function to concatenate an array of strings into a single string
  char *arr[] = {"hello", "world", "mom"};
  char *s3 = ", ".join(arr, 3);
  printf("%s\n", s3);

  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: 
The error occurred because the C compiler was unable to find the standard library functions `printf`, `strlen`, and `sprintf`. These functions are implicit declarations, which means that they must be declared in a header file before use. The fix is to declare these functions in the `<stdio.h>` header file before using them. The corrected code includes these function declarations at the beginning of the program, and uses them to print the output as requested.
