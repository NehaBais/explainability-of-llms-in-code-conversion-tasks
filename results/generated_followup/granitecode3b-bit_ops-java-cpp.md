The error is that the C++ compiler cannot find the `cout` header file, which contains the `cout` object used to print the output of the program. To fix this, you need to include the `iostream` header file at the beginning of your C++ code. The corrected code would look like this:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;
 
void foo() {
    cout << "bar";
}
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```
