The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the header files `os` and `iostream`. The `os` header file is part of the C++ Standard Library, while the `iostream` header file is part of the C++ I/OStreams library. To fix this, you can add the include paths for these libraries to your compiler options.
The corrected code in a single code block:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 if (rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0) {
  std::cerr << "Error renaming file in current working directory" << std::endl;
  return 1;
 }
 if (rename("docs", "mydocs") != 0) {
  std::cerr << "Error renaming directory in current working directory" << std::endl;
  return 1;
 }
 if (rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt") != 0) {
  std::cerr << "Error renaming file in root filesystem" << std::endl;
  return 1;
 }
 if (rename("/docs", "/mydocs") != 0) {
  std::cerr << "Error renaming directory in root filesystem" << std::endl;
  return 1;
 }
 return 0;
}
```
