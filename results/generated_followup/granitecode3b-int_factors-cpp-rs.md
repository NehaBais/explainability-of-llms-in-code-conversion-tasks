The error occurs because of the type mismatch between `i32` and `u32`. The `Rem` trait is not implemented for `i32`, so the expression `n % i` cannot be evaluated. The same error occurs with the `Div` trait when dividing an `i32` by a `u32`.
The fix involves converting `n` from `i32` to `u32` and then performing the calculation. The corrected code is as follows:
```rs
fn generate_factors(n: u32) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut factors = vec![1, n as i32];

    for i in 2..=(n as f64).sqrt().ceil() as u32 {
        if n % i == 0 {
            factors.push(i);

            if i * i != n {
                factors.push(n / i);
            }
        }
    }

    factors.sort();
    factors
}
```
The type of `n` is changed from `i32` to `u32`. The calculation in the loop remains the same, but the cast from `u32` to `i32` is added before pushing it into the vector.
