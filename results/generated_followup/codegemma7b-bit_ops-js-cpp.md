**Error:** The error occurs because the `>>>` operator requires an integral expression on both sides. In this case, `a` and `b` are integers, but `b` is used as an expression on the right side of the operator.

**Fix:** To fix the error, use `a >> b` instead of `a >>> b`. The latter operator performs logical right shift, which is not what is required in this case.

**Corrected Code:**

```cpp
void bitwise(int a, int b) {
  std::cout << "a & b: " << (a & b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a | b: " << (a | b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a ^ b: " << (a ^ b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "~a: " << (~a) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a << b: " << (a << b) << std::endl;   // left shift
  std::cout << "a >> b: " << (a >> b) << std::endl;   // arithmetic right shift
  std::cout << "a >>> b: " << (a >> b) << std::endl; // logical right shift
}
```
