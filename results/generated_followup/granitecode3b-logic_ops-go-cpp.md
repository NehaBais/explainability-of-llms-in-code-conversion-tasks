The error message indicates that there are several errors in the Golang code. Here's how to fix them:
1. The first two lines use backticks, which is not a valid way to include headers in C++. To fix this, remove the backticks and replace `include` with `"iostream"`.
2. The third line uses the `using namespace std;` directive, which conflicts with the standard library header file. To fix this, change it to `#include `.
3. All four lines use undeclared identifiers for functions like `cout`, so they need to be replaced with their actual function names.
Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
  bool a = true;
  bool b = false;
  cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << endl;
  cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << endl;
  cout << "not a is " << (!a) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
The corrected code uses standard C++ syntax and does not contain any errors.
