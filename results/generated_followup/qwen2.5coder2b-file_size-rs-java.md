The error is that `IOException` is never thrown in body of corresponding try statement, which means that there is an exception that can be caught but is not being handled within the catch block.

To fix this issue, we need to add a catch block for `IOException` and handle it appropriately.

Rewritten code:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    if (args.length < 1) {
      System.err.println("No file name supplied");
      System.exit(1);
    }

    File inputTxtFile = new File(args[0]);
    File rootDir = new File("/");

    try {
      long sizeOfInputTxt = inputTxtFile.length();
      long sizeOfRootDir = rootDir.length();

      System.out.println("Size of file.txt is " + sizeOfInputTxt + " bytes");
      System.out.println("Size of root directory is " + sizeOfRootDir + " bytes");
    } catch (IOException e) {
      System.err.println("Error reading the file(s): " + e.getMessage());
      System.exit(2);
    }
  }
}
```
