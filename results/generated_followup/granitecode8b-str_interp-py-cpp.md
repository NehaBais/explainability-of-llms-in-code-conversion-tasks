The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the header file "string" which contains the definition of the `std::string` class. This means that the code needs to include the necessary header files in order for the code to compile successfully. The fix is to add the line `#include` at the top of the file, before any other code.
Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include
int main() {
 std::string extra = "little";
 std::string new_str = "Mary had a " + extra + " lamb.";
 std::cout << new_str << std::endl;
 return 0;
}
```
