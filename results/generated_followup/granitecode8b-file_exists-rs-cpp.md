The error is that the C++ compiler cannot find the `std` header file, which contains the definition of the `stat` function used in the code. The fix is to add `#include  to the top of the code. The corrected code is as follows:
```c++
#include 
int main() {
 std::string files[] = {"input.txt", "docs"};
 for (const auto &file : files) {
 struct stat file_info;
 if (stat(file.c_str(), &file_info) == 0) {
 std::cout << file << " is a directory" << std::endl;
 } else if (errno == ENOENT) {
 std::cerr << file << " does not exist" << std::endl;
 } else {
 std::cerr << file << " is neither a file nor a directory" << std::endl;
 }
 }
 return 0;
}
```
