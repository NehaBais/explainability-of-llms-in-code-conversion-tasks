The first error is that the C++ code includes the header `<iostream>` but the C version does not. This causes a compilation error. The second error is that both the C++ and C versions use `printf()` and `scanf()` functions, which are not part of the C standard library. To fix these errors, you can include the necessary headers in the C code.
