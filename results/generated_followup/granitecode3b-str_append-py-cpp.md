The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the "std" header file, which contains the std namespace. To fix this issue, we need to include the necessary header files before using any standard library functions or classes.
The corrected code block is as follows:
```cpp
#include 
int main() {
  std::string str = "12345678";
  str += "9!";
  std::cout << str;
  return 0;
}
```
