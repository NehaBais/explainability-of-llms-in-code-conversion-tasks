The error message is indicating that Rust expects an item (such as a function, variable, type, etc) but found a keyword `let` instead. In Rust let bindings are not considered items in the same way they are in Python or JavaScript where they can be re-used across scopes and form part of expressions.

In Rust, you should declare an item with the keyword `let` only when it is the top level item (this applies to functions, variables, types etc). If you want to use let bindings inside a function/method body for temporary storage or in loop bodies, then you need to use the `let` statement without declaring a new item.

Here's how this code block should be rewritten:
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut string = String::from("def");
    string.insert_str(0, "abc");
}
```
