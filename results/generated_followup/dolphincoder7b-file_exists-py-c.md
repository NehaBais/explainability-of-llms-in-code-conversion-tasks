The error occurs because `printf` is not a standard library function in C, but it's part of the Standard I/O (POSIX) functions that are available through the `<stdio.h>` header file. To fix this issue, we need to include the `stdio.h` library by adding `#include  <stdio.h>`.

Here is the corrected code:

```c
#include  <unistd.h>
#include  <sys/stat.h>
#include  <sys/types.h>
#include  <stdio.h>
#include  <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  struct stat file_info, dir_info;

  if (stat("input.txt", &file_info) != 0 ||
      stat("/input.txt", &file_info) != 0) {
    printf("File does not exist!\n");
    return -1;
  }

  if ((file_info.st_mode  & S_IFMT) == S_IFREG &&
      file_info.st_uid  == geteuid()) {
     // File exists and can be accessed by the current user
     // Additional checks can be performed here based on other attributes in
     // `file_info`
   }

  if (stat("docs", &dir_info) != 0 || stat("/docs", &dir_info) != 0) {
    printf("Directory does not exist!\n");
    return -2;
  }

  if ((dir_info.st_mode  & S_IFMT) == S_IFDIR && dir_info.st_uid  == geteuid()) {
     // Directory exists and can be accessed by the current user
     // Additional checks can be performed here based on other attributes in
     // `dir_info`
   }
}
```

Note that we also included `<stdlib.h>` to include the function `exit`, which is used to exit the program after printing an error message if necessary.
