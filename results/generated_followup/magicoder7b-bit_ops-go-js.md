 The error occurs because JavaScript does not support multiple declarations on the same line when declaring variables. 

The correct fix is to separate variable declaration with comma:

```js
let a = -460, b = 6;
```
In this corrected version, two different variables `a` and `b` are declared each with its own value `-460` and `6`, respectively.
