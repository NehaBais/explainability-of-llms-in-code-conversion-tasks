Your request can be understood as a conversion from Python to C which involves moving files or directories from one location to another, specifically the current directory (here) and filesystem root respectively. 

However, note that in C there is no built-in way to directly rename a file or folder with its path as we do in Python's `os.rename()` function. You can use file redirection operations to achieve this task.

Consider the following C code snippet:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // Rename here file from input.txt to output.txt
  if (rename("input.txt", "output.txt") == -1) {
    printf("Failed to rename input.txt\n");
    return 1; // Exit with error
  }

  // Redirect here the current directory's docs to mydocs
  if (rename("docs", "mydocs") == -1) {
    printf("Failed to redirect the current directory's docs\n");
    return 1; // Exit with error
  }

  // Redirect filesystem root's docs to mydocs
  if (rename("/docs", "/mydocs") == -1) {
    printf("Failed to redirect the filesystem root's docs\n");
    return 1; // Exit with error
  }

  printf("Successfully renamed files and directories\n");
  return 0; // Successful exit
}
```

This C program does not use Python `os.rename()` as it is used for renaming a file or directory in the current working directory, which you have already done. The code redirects the existing "docs" directory to "mydocs" under both the current and filesystem roots. 

Again, be aware that filesystem root usually requires administrative privileges due to security reasons and note that `rename()` has a return value of -1 when an error occurs. You need to handle such errors appropriately.
