The error occurs because Rust does not allow crate names to have a dot `.` character. To fix this, replace `qwen2.5coder2b_str_interp_cpp_rs` with `qwen2_5coder2b_str_interp_cpp_rs`. 

Rust is case-sensitive. Hence the `QWEN2_5CODER2B_STR_INTERP_CXX_RS` and `qwen2_5coder2b_str_interp_cpp_rs` are different.
