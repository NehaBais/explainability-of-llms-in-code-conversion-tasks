Here is an explanation of the error:

1) Assignment Operator Error: The assignment operator (=) isn't recognized here as it would require a variable defined first. It's trying to assign a value to a raw pointer which is invalid in Rust programming language.

This kind of errors often come from the misuse of the programming language or incorrect usage of the syntax or language features provided by the language. The problem lies in the line number and character position where it occurs.

The error can be fixed as follows:

1) Replace all the raw pointer with a variable name (let's say `a`), this will allow the assignment to work correctly.
2) Ensure there is not any syntax error in your code before trying to fix the error, this usually involves proper ordering of operations or making sure that all parentheses are closed properly.
3) If you know what the 'raw pointer' represents and what it should represent after correcting the mistake, comment on that, so I (the AI) can understand better.
4) Try running your code again.

Your corrected code would look like this:
```rust
// Incorrect usage of raw pointer
let a: i32 = *b; 

// Corrected version
let mut a = b.clone();
```
