The error in this case is related to the use of the ternary operator within the calculation of `truncated_quotient`. The issue arises due to an extraneous ')' before ';' in the line.

The fix for this error is to adjust the parentheses placement such that the ternary operator and its arguments are properly grouped, thus avoiding any extraneous ')' or any similar issues.

Here's a single fenced code block containing the corrected code:

```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  cout << "Enter two integers: ";
  cin >> a >> b;

  // Display operations
  cout << a << " + " << b << " = " << (a + b) << endl;
  cout << a << " - " << b << " = " << (a - b) << endl;
  cout << a << " * " << b << " = " << (a * b) << endl;

  // Calculate quotient and rounding
  double quotient = double(a) / double(b);
  int truncated_quotient = int(quotient + 0.5));
  cout << a << " / " << b << " = approximately " << truncated_quotient << endl; // truncates towards zero

  return 0;
}
```
