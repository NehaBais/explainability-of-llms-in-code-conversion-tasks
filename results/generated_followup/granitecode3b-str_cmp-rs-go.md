The error message indicates that the variables `a2` and `b2` are declared but not used in the code. This is likely due to a typo or an incorrect import statement. To fix this, simply remove the unused variable declarations and run the code again. The corrected code should now compile without errors. Here's the rewritten code:
```go
package main
import (
 "fmt"
 "strings"
)
func main() {
 a := "abc"
 b := "Bac"
 // only same types can be compared
 // String and String or &str and &str
 // exception: strict equality and inequality also work on &str and String
 if a == b {
  fmt.Println("The strings are equal")
 }
 if a != b {
  fmt.Println("The strings are not equal")
 }
 if a > b {
  fmt.Println("The first string is lexically after the second")
 }
 if a < b {
  fmt.Println("The first string is lexically before the second")
 }
 if a >= b {
  fmt.Println("The first string is not lexically before the second")
 }
 if a <= b {
  fmt.Println("The first string is not lexically after the second")
 }
 // case-insensitives:

 // equality
 // this avoids new allocations
 if strings.EqualFold(a, b) {
  fmt.Println("Both strings are equal when ignoring case")
 }
}
```
