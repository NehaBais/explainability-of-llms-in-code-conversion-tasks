 The error is due to the fact that `std::filesystem` is not included in the code, which is required for file system operations.

The fix is to include `<filesystem>` at the beginning of the code.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

void create_directory(const std::string &path) {
  try {
    if (!fs::exists(path)) {
      fs::create_directories(path);
      std::cout << "Directory created successfully." << std::endl;
    } else {
      std::cout << "Directory already exists." << std::endl;
    }
  } catch (const fs::filesystem_error &e) {
    std::cerr << "An error occurred: " << e.what() << std::endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  std::string path = "./path/to/dir";
  create_directory(path);
  return 0;
}
```
