Error: The `main` function is not found in the crate. 
Fix: Add a `main` function to the code enclosed in backticks. 
Corrected Code:
```rust
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}

fn main() {
    logic(true, false);
}
``` 
Explanation of the error and fix: The `main` function is not found in the crate because it is not explicitly defined. To fix this, we need to define the `main` function that calls the `logic` function with sample input values. The `main` function serves as the entry point for the program, and without a `main` function, the compiler will not be able to compile the code successfully.
