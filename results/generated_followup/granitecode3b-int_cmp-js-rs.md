The first error is caused by the fact that `read_line()` returns a string, but we are trying to assign it to an integer variable. The solution is to use the `trim()` method on the string before parsing it as an integer. The second error is caused by the fact that `trim()` returns a String, not an integer, so we need to parse it using `parse()`. The third error is the same as the first one.
The corrected code is:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut a = 0;
    let mut b = 0;

    println!("Enter first integer:");
    let _ = std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut a).expect("Failed to read line");
    a = a.trim().parse::<i32>().unwrap();

    println!("Enter second integer:");
    let _ = std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut b).expect("Failed to read line");
    b = b.trim().parse::<i32>().unwrap();

    if a < b {
        println!("{} is less than {}", a, b);
    } else if a == b {
        println!("{} equals {}", a, b);
    } else {
        println!("{} is greater than {}", a, b);
    }
}
```
The corrected code uses the `let` keyword to bind the result of `read_line()` to `_`, which prevents name conflicts. The error caused by using the same variable for both inputs and outputs is also fixed in this implementation.
