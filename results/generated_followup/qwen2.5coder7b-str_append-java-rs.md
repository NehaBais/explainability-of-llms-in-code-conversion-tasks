**Error Explanation:** The error occurs because Rust does not allow dots (`.`) in crate names, which is typically used in file paths for Rust modules or crates.

**Fix Explanation:** Rename the file to remove any invalid characters such as dots from the crate name.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut string = String::from("abc");
    println!("{}", string);
    string.push_str("def");
    println!("{}", string);
}
```
