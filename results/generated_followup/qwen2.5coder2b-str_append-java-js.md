The error message indicates that there is an issue with the class definition syntax, which is not valid JavaScript. In ES6 (and later), classes are defined using the `class` keyword. To fix this issue, we need to replace the `public static void main(String[] args)` method body with a function expression. Here's the corrected code:

```js
(function() {
    class strAppend {
        main() {
            let string = "abc";
            console.log(string);
            string += "def";
            console.log(string);
        }
    }

    new strAppend().main();
})();
```

The `new strAppend().main()` part is used to create an instance of the `strAppend` class and call its `main` method, which will print out the modified string.
