The error message indicates that there are multiple issues with the code. The first two errors indicate that the compiler cannot find the `std` library, which is required for using C++ features such as strings and input/output streams. The next four errors indicate that the compiler does not recognize the syntax of some of the code statements. Finally, the last error indicates that the variable `chars` is used without being declared.
To fix these issues, we need to include the necessary header files for the standard library, declare the variables `char` and `chars`, and use the correct syntax for function calls and string indexing. Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 std::string s = "abcdefgh";
 int n = 2, m = 3;
 char char = 'd';
 char chars[] = "cd";
 // starting from n=2 characters in and m=3 in length;
 std::cout << s.substr(n - 1, m) << std::endl;
 // starting from n characters in, up to the end of the string;
 std::cout << s.substr(n - 1) << std::endl;
 // whole string except last character
 std::cout << s.substr(0, s.length() - 1) << std::endl;
 int indx = s.find(char);
 std::cout << s.substr(indx, m) << std::endl;
 indx = s.find(chars);
 std::cout << s.substr(indx, m) << std::endl;
 return 0;
}
```
In this corrected code, we have included the necessary header files for the standard library and declared the variables `char` and `chars`. We have also used the correct syntax for function calls and string indexing. Additionally, we have fixed the error in the variable declaration by using a single character as the array size instead of an array expression. Finally, we have returned 0 to indicate that the program has executed successfully.
