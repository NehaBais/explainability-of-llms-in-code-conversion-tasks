Error: The code is missing the header file `stdio.h` that declares the `printf` function, which is used to display the substrings.
Fix: Add the following line at the top of the code to include the `stdio.h` file: `#include stdio.h`.
```c
#include stdio.h
int main() {
  char const *s = "0123456789";
  int const n = 3;
  int const m = 4;
  char const c = '2';
  std::string const sub = "456";

 printf("%.*s
", m, s + n);
 printf("%s
", s + n);
 printf("%.*s
", (int)strlen(s) - 1, s);
 printf("%.*s
", m, strstr(s, c));
 printf("%.*s
", m, strstr(s, sub));
 return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the `printf` function is used to display the substrings, but it was not included in the header file that was included at the beginning of the code. By adding the `#include stdio.h` line, the compiler will be able to find the declaration of the `printf` function and resolve the error.
The fix simply adds the necessary include statement to include the `stdio.h` file. After making this change, the code should compile without any errors or warnings.
