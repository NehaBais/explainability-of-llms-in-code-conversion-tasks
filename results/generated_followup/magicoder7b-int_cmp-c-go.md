 The error is caused by the variables 'a' and 'b' being undefined. In Go, unlike C/C++, you canâ€™t just declare variables anywhere, they must be declared at the top of a function or before the main function. The correct way to do this in Go is by declaring them as local variables inside the `main` function.

The fixed code will look like this:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	var a, b int
	_, err := fmt.Scan(&a, &b)
	if err != nil {
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	if a < b {
		fmt.Printf("%d is less than %d\n", a, b)
	}

	if a == b {
		fmt.Printf("%d is equal to %d\n", a, b)
	}

	if a > b {
		fmt.Printf("%d is greater than %d\n", a, b)
	}
}
```
In this fixed code, the `var` keyword is used to declare the variables 'a' and 'b'. The type of these variables is also specified (int). The `_, err := fmt.Scan(&a, &b)` line reads two integers from the command-line arguments and stores them in 'a' and 'b', respectively.
