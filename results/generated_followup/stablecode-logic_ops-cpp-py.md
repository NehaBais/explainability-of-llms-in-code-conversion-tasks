Error: The function contains unmatched parentheses.

Fix: Close all open parentheses in the function.

Corrected code: 

```py
def print_logic(a, b):
    print("a and b is ", a and b)
    print("a or b is ", a or b)
    print("not a is ", not a)
```

This corrected function now properly matches all parentheses, resolving the syntax error.
