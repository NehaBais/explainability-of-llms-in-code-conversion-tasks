The error message indicates that there are several issues with the code. The first error is that the file name is not enclosed in double quotes, which is required by C. The second error is that the `atoi` function is not declared, which means that it is not recognized as a valid function by the compiler. The third error is that the `printf` function is not declared, which is also not recognized as a valid function by the compiler. The fourth error is that there are missing or mismatched quotation marks around string literals in some of the `printf` statements. The fifth error is that there is an extra semicolon at the end of the code block.
The fix for these errors involves adding missing quotation marks, declaring the `atoi` and `printf` functions, and removing the extra semicolon. Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include 
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int a = atoi(argv[1]);
  int b = atoi(argv[2]);

  int sum = a + b;
  int difference = a - b;
  int product = a * b;
  float division = (float)a / b; // Casting to float to avoid integer division and get decimal result
  int remainder = a % b;

  printf("a + b = %d
", sum);
  printf("a - b = %d
", difference);
  printf("a * b = %d
", product);
  printf("a / b = %.2f (rounded)
", division); //%.2f is used to print only 2 decimal places
  printf("a %% b = %d (remainder matches sign of first operand)
", remainder);

  return 0;
}
```
