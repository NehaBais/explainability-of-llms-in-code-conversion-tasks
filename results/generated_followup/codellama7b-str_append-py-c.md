The error message is indicating that the `strcat` function is undeclared, which means it's not included in the current C compilation unit. You need to include the `<string.h>` header file to use this function.

Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char *str = "12345678";
  strcat(str, "9!");
  printf("%s\n", str);
  return 0;
}
```
