The error in this case is - 

```error: expected item, found keyword `let`
 --> /tmp/stablecode-file_size-js-rs.rs:3:1
  |
3 | let metadata = fs::metadata("input.txt")?;
  | ^^ consider using `const` or `static` instead of `let` for global variables
```

The fix to this problem is to replace the `let` keyword with a `const` keyword, as explained below: 

- The `let` keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned later. 
- In contrast, the `const` keyword is used to declare a constant variable, which means its value cannot be changed after it has been initialized. 

Therefore, to fix this problem, you should replace the `let` keyword with a `const` keyword in your Rust code. Here's an example of how you might do that:
```rs
use std::fs;

const METADATA: fs::Metadata = fs::metadata("input.txt")?;
println!("Size of input.txt is {}", METADATA.len());
```
In this corrected code, the `let` keyword has been replaced with a `const` keyword for the `metadata` variable. This ensures that the value of `metadata` cannot be changed later on in the code, which is consistent with the behavior of `const` variables in other programming languages.
