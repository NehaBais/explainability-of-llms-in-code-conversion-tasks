The error occurs because the `andThen` method is not a part of the File class in Java.

The fix is to replace it with `thenAccept`. It is used for handling the result of the previous operation, here it's used for calling createRoot() after create(".").

Here is the corrected code:
```java
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
  private static final String FILE_NAME = "output.txt";
  private static final String DIR_NAME = "docs";

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    create(".").thenAccept(Main::createRoot);
  }

  // ... existing code ...
}
```
