Error: The Rust compiler is unable to find the value `toBeReplaced` in the current scope. This occurs because the variable name is different between the C++ code and the Rust code.
Fix: Rename the variable `toBeReplaced` in the Rust code to match the variable name used in the C++ code.
Corrected Code:
```rs
fn main() {
    let original = "Mary had a X lamb.";
    let to_be_replaced = "X";
    let replacement = "little";
    let new_string = original.replace(&to_be_replaced, &replacement);
    println!("String after replacement: {}", new_string);
}
``` 
Explanation: The error occurs because the Rust compiler is unable to find the variable `toBeReplaced` in the current scope, even though it exists in the C++ code. This is because Rust has its own way of naming variables and uses a different syntax for variable declarations compared to C++. By renaming the variable name in Rust, we can make it match the one used in the C++ code, making the error go away.
