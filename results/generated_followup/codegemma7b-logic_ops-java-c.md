The error is that the C code uses the `bool` data type without including the necessary header file. The fix is to include the `stdbool.h` header file.

```c
#include <stdbool.h>

void logic(bool a, bool b) {
  cout << "a AND b: " << (a && b) << endl;
  cout << "a OR b: " << (a || b) << endl;
  cout << "NOT a: " << !a << endl;
}
```
