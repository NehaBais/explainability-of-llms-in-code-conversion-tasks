The error message indicates that there is no method named `readline` for struct `Stdin`. This is because Rust's standard library has replaced Java's `Scanner` with the `std::io` module, which provides a more flexible and safer way to read input from the user.
The fix is to import the `std::io::stdin()` function and use it instead of `java.io.BufferedReader`. The `stdin()` function returns an instance of `std::io::Stdin`, which has a `read_line()` method that can be used to read a line of input from the user.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
use std::io;
fn main() {
    let mut stdin = io::stdin();

    println!("Enter first integer:");
    let nbr1: i32 = match stdin.read_line() {
        Ok(val) => val.trim().parse().unwrap(),
        Err(_) => panic!("Failed to read line"),
    };

    println!("Enter second integer:");
    let nbr2: i32 = match stdin.read_line() {
        Ok(val) => val.trim().parse().unwrap(),
        Err(_) => panic!("Failed to read line"),
    };

    if nbr1 < nbr2 {
        println!("{} is less than {}", nbr1, nbr2);
    } else if nbr1 > nbr2 {
        println!("{} is greater than {}", nbr1, nbr2);
    } else {
        println!("{} is equal to {}", nbr1, nbr2);
    }
}
```
Note that the code now uses `read_line()` instead of `readline()`, and that it returns a `Result` indicating whether the read was successful or not. The `unwrap()` method is used to extract the value from the `Ok` variant of the result, and a panic is triggered if the read fails.
