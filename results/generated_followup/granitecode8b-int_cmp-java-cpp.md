The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the `std` namespace, which is part of the C++ Standard Library. This means that the code needs to be linked with the C++ Standard Library in order to compile successfully. The fix is to add the `-lstdc++` flag when compiling the code. The corrected code is shown below:
```cpp
#include
#include
int main() {
  int nbr1, nbr2;
  std::cin >> nbr1 >> nbr2;
  if (nbr1 < nbr2) {
    std::cout << nbr1 << " is less than " << nbr2 << std::endl;
  } else if (nbr1 > nbr2) {
    std::cout << nbr1 << " is greater than " << nbr2 << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << nbr1 << " is equal to " << nbr2 << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
