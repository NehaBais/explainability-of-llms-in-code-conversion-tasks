The error in the code is due to the fact that Java's "implicitly declared classes" feature is still in preview, which are disabled by default. This feature allows you to declare a variable without explicitly specifying its type, and it's designed for when you have variables that aren’t assigned explicit types—for example, if you don’t know what the user will give you. Unfortunately, this feature isn't available in Java’s current version.

The fix is simply to remove `String s = "hello";` from your code and replace it with just `String s = "hello";` because String literals are implicitly declared as a String type in Java.

Here is the corrected code:
```java
// Declare and assign the variable 's' as a String value
String s = "hello";

// Create another string variable with the concatenated result of 's' and another string literal 
String t = s + " there!";

// Print out the contents of 't' to confirm the operation
System.out.println(t);
```
