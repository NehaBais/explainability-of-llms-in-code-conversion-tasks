Error: `String extra = "little";` is an implicitly declared class, which is a preview feature in Java 17 and later versions. To fix this error, you can use the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling the code.
Fix: Use the `--enable-preview` flag to enable implicitly declared classes in Java.
Corrected code:
```java
String extra = "little";
String newStr = String.format("Mary had a %s lamb.", extra);
System.out.println(newStr);
```
Explanation:
The error occurred because the `extra` variable is an implicitly declared class in Java 17 and later versions, which are not enabled by default. To fix this error, you need to enable the preview feature during compilation using the `--enable-preview` flag. The corrected code uses the `String.format()` method to perform string interpolation and prints the output "Mary had a little lamb."
