Error: The compiler is unable to find the header file "string". 
Fix: Add the following line of code at the beginning of the file: `#include `
Rewritten code:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
  string original = "Mary had a X lamb";
  string little = "little";

  // String interpolation using the replace function in C++
  string replaced = original.replace(original.find("X"), 1, little);

  cout << "Original string: " << original << endl;
  cout << "Replaced string: " << replaced << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
Explanation of error: The compiler is unable to find the header file "string". This is because the code includes a using namespace directive, which changes the default namespace in C++. Since the code uses the string class from the std namespace, it needs the header file for the string class.
Explanation of fix: The line `using namespace std;` adds the std namespace to the list of implicitly-used namespaces. This tells the compiler that it should look for the "string" class and other standard library classes in the std namespace when compiling the code.
Rewritten explanation: The corrected code includes the necessary header file for the string class, which resolves the error caused by the missing header file. The code uses the string interpolation feature of C++ to replace the character sequence "X" with the value of "little". Finally, it prints out both the original and replaced strings using the cout statement.
