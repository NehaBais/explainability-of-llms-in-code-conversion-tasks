Error: 
- The C code includes an incorrect header file for the `stat` function, which is not standard and needs to be included separately.
- There are two errors related to incomplete type definitions for the `struct stat`.
- There are two more errors related to undeclared library functions.
- Finally, there is a warning about the use of the non-standard `printf` function.
Fix: 
- Include the necessary header file for the `stat` function by adding `#include <sys/stat.h>` before any other includes.
- Remove the incomplete type definition errors by declaring the `struct stat` type before using it.
- Fix the undeclared library function errors by either providing a declaration for `perror` or including the appropriate header file with the definition.
- Fix the non-standard `printf` function error by adding `#include <stdio.h>` and modifying the `printf` call to use the correct function name (`printf`).
Rewritten Code:
```c
#include 
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include 
int main(void) {
  struct stat st1, st2;
  if (stat("input.txt", &st1) == -1) {
    perror("stat");
    return 1;
  }
  if (stat("/input.txt", &st2) == -1) {
    perror("stat");
    return 1;
  }
  printf("%zu %zun", st1.st_size, st2.st_size);
  return 0;
}
``` 
Explanation: 
The error in the original code was related to incorrect header files and incomplete type definitions for the `struct stat`. The fix involved adding the necessary header file for the `stat` function, removing the incomplete type definition errors by declaring the `struct stat` type before using it, and fixing the undeclared library function errors by either providing a declaration for `perror` or including the appropriate header file with the definition. Finally, the non-standard `printf` function error was fixed by adding `#include <stdio.h>` and modifying the `printf` call to use the correct function name (`printf`).
