 The errors you are encountering are due to mismatched types with the methods used for bitwise operations. In particular, `wrapping_shr` method operates on unsigned integers but takes an unsigned integer as its argument, while the `a & b as i32` statement tries to perform a binary AND operation between two signed integers which is not allowed in Rust and thus fails with the error E0601.

Here's how you can fix it: 

```rs
fn bitwise(mut a: i32, b: u8) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", (a & b as i32));
    println!("a OR b: {}", (a | b as i32));
    println!("a XOR b: {}", (a ^ b as i32));
    println!("NOT a: {}", ~a);
    println!("a << b: {}", (a << b) as i32); // left shift
    println!("a >> b: {}", ((a & 0xffff_ffff) as u32).wrapping_shr(b)); // arithmetic right shift, Rust's `shr` doesn't support signed numbers
    println!("a >>> b: {}", (a.wrapping_shl(b) & 0xffff_ffff) as i32); // logical right shift with sign extension
}
```

Note that the `& 0xffff_ffff` operation is used to ensure that the bitwise shift operations do not overflow for signed integers `i32`. Also, in the rotation section of code, `a.wrapping_shl(b)` is used instead of `a << b` to prevent the overflow issue because Rust does not support left-rotation operation on negative numbers.
