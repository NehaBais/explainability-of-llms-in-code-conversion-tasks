The error occurs because Rust does not have direct support for comparing numbers with string representations, as JavaScript does. To handle this, we need to convert both sides of the comparison to the same type before comparing them. In this case, we can use `String::from()` or `to_string()`. 

Note: If you want to compare floating-point numbers with each other in Rust, they need to be converted into strings and then compared. This involves a manual conversion from f64 to String because Rust doesn't have built-in functionality for this conversion. The corrected code is as follows:

```rust
use std::fmt;

fn main() {
    println!("{:?}", "abcd" == "abcd");  // true
    println!("{:?}", "abcd" != "dcba");  // false
    println!("{:?}", String::from("123") == "123".to_string());  // true
    println!("{:?}", format!("{:?}", 123f64) != "123".to_string());  // false
    println!("{:?}", "ABCD".to_lowercase()  == "abcd".to_lowercase());  // true (case insensitive)
}
```

In this modified version, we use the `format!` macro to convert f64 into string and then compare it with other strings. The `fmt` library is used for formatting floating-point numbers as strings.
