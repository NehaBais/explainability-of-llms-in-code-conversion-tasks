The error indicates that the `access` function is not declared. This issue can be resolved by including the `<unistd.h>` header file.

Here is the corrected code with the fix:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  // Check for input.txt in current working directory
  if (access("docs/input.txt", F_OK) == 0) {
    printf("Input file 'docs/input.txt' exists.\n");
  } else {
    printf("Input file 'docs/input.txt' does not exist.\n");
  }

  // Check for input.txt in the root directory
  if (access("/docs/input.txt", F_OK) == 0) {
    printf("Input file '/docs/input.txt' exists.\n");
  } else {
    printf("Input file '/docs/input.txt' does not exist.\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. The `#include <unistd.h>` line is added to the header section of the code. This includes the necessary function declaration for `access`.
2. The compiler now correctly recognizes the `access` function and its parameters.
3. The corrected code snippet is enclosed in backticks, as requested.
