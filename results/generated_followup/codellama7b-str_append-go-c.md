The error is caused by the fact that C does not have a native string type, so the `<string>` header file is not included in the C standard library. The fix is to include the `<stdio.h>` header file, which provides functions for printing strings to the console. The corrected code should look like this:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  std::string s = "foo";
  s += "bar";
  printf("%s\n", s.c_str());
  return 0;
}
```
