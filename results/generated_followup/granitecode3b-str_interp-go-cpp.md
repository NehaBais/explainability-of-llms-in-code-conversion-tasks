Error: The Golang code is trying to include two different headers, `#include` and `<FILENAME>`, which conflict with each other. 
Fix: Remove the `#include` line from the Golang code and use the correct header for including the `string` class in C++.
```cpp
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
  string str = "Mary had a %s lamb";
  string txt = "little";
  string out = str.replace("%s", txt);
  cout << out << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the Golang code was trying to include two different headers for including the `string` class, which caused a conflict. By removing the `#include` line from the Golang code and using the correct header for including the `string` class in C++, we were able to resolve this error.
