The error occurs due to unexpected parentheses at the end of statements, which violate the syntax rules of Go programming language.

To fix this issue, remove the extra closing parentheses from the code. Additionally, make sure that each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the same statement or block.

Corrected code:
```go
package main

import (
		"fmt"
	)

func main() {
    s := "abc文字化けdef"
    n := 2
    m := 3

    // Print 
}
```
