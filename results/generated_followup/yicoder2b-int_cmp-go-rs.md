There are indeed some errors in your code. The first thing I would want to see is the original code, followed by the error message from rustc, then a explanation of the error. Here's what you can do:

```rust
fn main() {
    let n1 = 5; // replace with your integer
    let n2 = 3; // replace with your integer
    // comparing n1 and n2 without any operation
}
```
Then, you can run rustc on it to get more detailed error messages. You can run `rustc src/main.rs` in the `src` directory of your project. This will give you an output indicating what kind of errors were found and where they occurred.

If the error `E0614: type '{integer}' cannot be dereferenced` occurs, it means that you tried to use some sort of type without dereferencing (i.e., not taking a pointer value or reference), probably in an operation involving them like equality (`==`), inequality (`!=`), addition(`+`, `-` etc), etc. 

To fix the error, you should replace `{integer}` with the actual type of your variables such as `i32` (for integers), `f64` (for floating point numbers like `3.14`), etc. Make sure that the type used in the for example an equality operation is consistent with the types being compared and also replace `5` and `3` with your actual values.

If you need more detailed error messages, you can use them with `rustc src/main.rs -e ERRORTYPE` where ERRORTYPE should be one of: E0111, E0246, E0387, E0538, E0639, E0648, E0658, E0673, E0678. Each error code corresponds to an error category with its own explanation. For example, `E0614` is about type-related errors.

I hope this helps you locate the problem in a more detailed way. Happy coding!
