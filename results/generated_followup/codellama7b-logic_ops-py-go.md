The error occurred because the Go compiler expected to see a "package" statement at the beginning of the file, but instead found a "func" declaration. This is because in Go, functions must be declared within a package.

To fix the error, we need to add a package declaration at the top of the file:
```go
package main

func logic(a bool, b bool) {
    fmt.Println("a and b:", a && b)
    fmt.Println("a or b:", a || b)
    fmt.Println("not a:", !a)
}
```
This code declares the package "main" and includes the function definition within it.
