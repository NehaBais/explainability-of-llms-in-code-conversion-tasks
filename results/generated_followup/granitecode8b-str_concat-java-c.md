The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the `printf` and `sprintf` functions, which are part of the C standard library. To fix this error, we need to include the `<stdio.h>` header file at the beginning of the program to declare these functions. Additionally, we need to modify the code to use the correct format specifier for printing strings in C. Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include
int main() {
  char s[] = "hello";
  printf("%s literaln", s);
  char s2[50];
  sprintf(s2, "%s literal", s);
  printf("%sn", s2);
  return 0;
}
```
This code includes the `<stdio.h>` header file and uses the correct format specifier for printing strings (`%s` instead of `n`).
