The error occurs because the "path/filepath" package is imported but not used. To fix this, remove the import statement for "path/filepath".

Additionally, there are two issues with the Go code:
1. The line "err := os.MkdirAll("docs", os.ModePerm)" has a typo in it. It should be "err  := os.MkdirAll("/docs", os.ModePerm)".
2. The line "defer f.Close()" is missing the call to Close(). This will cause an error if a panic occurs before calling Close(), as the file handle is not properly closed.

The corrected code should look like this:
```go
package main

import  (
	 "os"
)

func main()  {
	err  := os.MkdirAll("/docs", os.ModePerm)
	if err != nil  {
		panic(err)
	}
	f, err  := os.Create("/output.txt")
	if err  != nil  {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer f.Close()
}
```
