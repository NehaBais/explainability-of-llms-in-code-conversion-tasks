 The error "/tmp/magicoder7b-str_prepend-c-go.go:6:2: "syscall" imported and not used" occurs because the `syscall` package is imported in the Go file but never used. Removing this unnecessary import should solve the problem. The correct code would be as follows:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	str := "my String"
	cstr := "Changed "
	dup := strings.TrimSpace(str) + "\x00" // to append null character at end of string, for strdup function in Go
	newStr := fmt.Sprintf("%s%s", cstr, dup)
	fmt.Println(newStr)
}
```

In this corrected code, only the `fmt`, `strings` packages are used. The `syscall` package is not necessary and its import statement is removed.
