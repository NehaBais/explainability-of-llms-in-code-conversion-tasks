The error in this case is related to the use of the `let` keyword to declare a variable named `extra`. In Rust, to define a global variable like in Python, we typically use the `const` or `static` keywords instead of `let`. 

To fix this error, you can replace the usage of `let` with either `const` or `static`. Here is an example of how you can modify the code:

```rs
const extra: &str = "little";
let new_str = format!("Mary had a {} lamb.", extra);
println!("{}", new_str);
```

In this modified code, we have replaced the `let` keyword with `const`, which declares a constant variable named `extra`. We have also declared the `new_str` variable as a regular mutable `String` object. Finally, we have added a `format!` macro invocation to interpolate the string and variable value into a single string. This is similar to how it was done in the original Python code.
