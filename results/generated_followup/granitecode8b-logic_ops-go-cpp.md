The error message indicates that there is an issue with the inclusion of the `` header file, which is required for using the `cout` statement. To fix this, the `#include` directive needs to be changed to `#include`. The corrected code is as follows:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
void printLogic(bool a, bool b) {
 cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << endl;
 cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << endl;
 cout << "not a is " << (!a) << endl;
}
```
