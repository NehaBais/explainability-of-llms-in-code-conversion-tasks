The error is that the C++ compiler cannot find the header file `vector`. To fix this, you need to include the header file containing the `vector` class by adding the following line at the beginning of your C++ file:

The corrected code in a single fenced code block:
```cpp
#include
#include
using namespace std;
vector factor(int num) {
  vector factors;
  for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(num); i++) {
    if (num % i == 0) {
      factors.push_back(i);
      factors.push_back(num / i);
    }
  }
  sort(factors.begin(), factors.end());
  return factors;
}
int main() {
  assert(factor(100) == vector({1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100}));
  assert(factor(101) == vector({1, 101}));
  return 0;
}
```
