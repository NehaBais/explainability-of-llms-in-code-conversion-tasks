 The error `E0601` means that the crate, or main function, was not found within the Rust file compiled. 

To fix this issue, we need to add a `main` function to our Rust code. In other words, you need a point of entry for your program. This is typically done by having a `main()` function and calling all the functions from there. Here's how you would rewrite your code:

```rs
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", (a && b));
    println!("a OR b: {}", (a || b));
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}

fn main() {
    // Call the logic function with some arguments.
    logic(true, false);
}
```
Here `main()` is the starting point of our Rust program, where you can call your other functions, in this case `logic()`.
