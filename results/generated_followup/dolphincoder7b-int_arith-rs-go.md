The error occurs because there is no package declaration in the Go program. Rust has its own package management system, Golang does not. As a result, the Rust to Golang conversion requires adding the `package main` statement at the beginning of the code. Here is how you can rewrite and correct this code:
1. Add the missing package declaration.
2. The `main` function should contain the code that calls the other functions, as well as any necessary imports.

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    // add necessary imports here
)
func main() {
    x, y := GET_INTEGERS()
    DISPLAY_OPERATIONS(x, y)
}

GET_INTEGERS():
    var x, y int
    fmt.Scanf("%d %d", &x, &y)

    return (x, y)

DISPLAY_OPERATIONS(x, y):
    sum := x + y
    difference := x - y
    product := x * y
    quotient := x / y   // truncates towards zero
    remainder := x % y   // same sign as first operand

    if  (exponentiation operator exists){
        exponentiation := x ^ y
    }

    fmt.Println("sum:", sum)
    fmt.Println("difference:", difference)
    fmt.Println("product:", product)
    fmt.Println("quotient:", quotient)
    fmt.Println("remainder:", remainder)
    if  (exponentiation operator exists){
        fmt.Println("exponentiation:", exponentiation)
    }
```

In the corrected code, we added an import for `fmt` which is the standard package in Golang for input/output operations. The main function calls `GET_INTEGERS()` and then `DISPLAY_OPERATIONS()`. In both functions, user inputs are read using `Scanf`, while the result of mathematical operations is printed using `Println`.
