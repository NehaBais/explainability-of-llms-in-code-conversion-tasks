The error occurs because Rust does not have an equivalent to C's `sys/stat.h` header file that provides the necessary functions, macros or types for working with file system metadata. Therefore, we need to use a different approach in Rust to access file information like size and other details. The error message suggests that we should import the `stat` function from the `os` module instead of directly using it.

To fix this issue and print the file sizes correctly, we can modify our code as follows:

```rs
use std::fs;
use std::os::macos::raw::stat;

fn main() {
    let file_info1 = stat("input.txt").unwrap();
    println!("{}", file_info1.st_size);

    let file_info2  = fs::metadata("/input.txt").unwrap();
    println!("{}", file_info2.len());
}
```

In this modified version, we have re-imported the `stat` function from the `os` module and used it to obtain the file size information for "input.txt". Additionally, we made a minor change to access the file size within the returned struct using `st_size` instead of `len()`. The `metadata` function in Rust returns an instance of the `Metadata` struct, which provides methods like `len()` to retrieve the file length in bytes.

By making these changes, we ensure that the code will work correctly and display the size of both "input.txt" and "/input.txt".
