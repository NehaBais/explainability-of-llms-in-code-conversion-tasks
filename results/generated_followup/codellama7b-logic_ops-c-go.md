The error message is indicating that the Go compiler expected to find the "package" keyword at the beginning of the file, but instead it found the "func" keyword, which indicates a function definition. This is because in Go, functions must be defined within a package, and the package declaration must come first in the file.

To fix this error, we need to add a package declaration at the top of the file. Here's an example of how the corrected code would look:
```go
package main

func printLogic(a, b bool) {
  fmt.Printf("a and b is %t\n", a && b)
  fmt.Printf("a or b is %t\n", a || b)
  fmt.Printf("not a is %t\n", !a)
}
```
In this code, the package declaration is `package main`, which indicates that this file defines the functions for the "main" package. The function definition starts with the keyword "func" followed by the name of the function (`printLogic`), then a list of input parameters in parentheses, and finally a semicolon at the end of the line.
