The error message indicates that there is an invalid character `'.'` in the crate name `qwen2.5coder7b_str_append_c_rs`. In Rust, crate names cannot contain special characters like `.`, `-`, or `_`.

To fix this, you can rename the file to remove any invalid characters from the crate name.

Here's the corrected code:

```rs
fn main() {
    let mut str = String::from("Good Morning");
    let cstr1 = " to all";
    let cstr2 = " !!!";

    // Append the strings using the `push_str` method
    str.push_str(cstr1);
    str.push_str(cstr2);

    println!("{}", str);  // Show the contents of the variable after the append operation
}
```

By renaming the file to a valid Rust crate name, this code will compile and run without any errors.
