The error is because Rust does not allow dots in crate names.

To correct this, we need to change the `crate_name` attribute of the Rust file from `qwen2.5coder2b_int_factors_java_rs` to something else that doesn't have dots in it. For example:

```rust
#[allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    let number = 18;
    let result = factors(number);
    println!("Factors of {}: {:?}", number, result);
}
```

This will resolve the error and compile your Rust code correctly.
