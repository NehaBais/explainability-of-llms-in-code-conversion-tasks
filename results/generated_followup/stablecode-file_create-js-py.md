The error is due to an unmatched parenthesis in the rename function. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that any open parentheses have matching closing parentheses. In this case, there is a missing closing parenthesis after `"/docs/output.txt"`. We can add it and fix the syntax error.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os

def fct(err):
    if err: 
        print(err)

try:
    os.makedirs("docs")

    with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
        pass

    os.rename("output.txt", "docs/output.txt"))

    os.makedirs("/docs"))

except Exception as e:
    fct(str(e)))
```

In the corrected code, we added a closing parenthesis `)` after `"/docs/output.txt"` to match the opening parenthesis `(` in the try block. This ensures that any open parentheses have matching closing parentheses and helps fix the syntax error.
