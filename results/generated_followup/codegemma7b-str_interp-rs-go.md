The error occurs because the named argument syntax in Golang requires the use of the `%` operator, not the `:=` operator. The fix is to replace the `:=` operator with `%` in the `fmt.Printf` call.

```go
func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Mary had a %s lamb\n", "little")
	fmt.Printf("%s had a %s lamb\n", "Mary", "little")
	fmt.Printf("%s had a %s lamb\n", name:="Mary", adj:="little")
}
```
