The error reported by the compiler is related to template instantiation errors when C++ standard library algorithms (like `std::get`) are called with arguments of a type which doesn't match the type used in the template definition. 

This generally happens when a type is not fully-defined or incomplete at that moment, and the compiler cannot decide whether it should instantiate the function template using a specific type or a base class of this type, or something else.

The solution to fix this error is to ensure all types that are used as arguments in `std::get` calls are fully-defined before the code runs. One way to achieve this is by defining these types at compile time and then include these in your code. Another approach could be to use a combination of templates, using a function or method which accepts different types and select them based on specific conditions. 

Here's how you could rewrite the problematic piece of code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream> // For stringstream
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::string str = "Mary had a %s lamb";
  std::string val = "little";

  // Create a stream from input string
  std::stringstream ss(str);

  // Replace %s with actual value and print to stdout
  ss << val;
  std::cout << ss.str() << std::endl;

  // Specify order
  std::string str2 = "{1} had a {0} lamb";
  std::swap(val, str);
  std::stringstream ss2(str2);
  ss2 << val << " " << str.substr(str.find_first_of(' ') + 1); // Extract the name
  std::cout << ss2.str() << std::endl;

  // Named arguments if you prefer
  const char *name = "Mary";
  const char *adj = "little";
  std::string str3 = "{name} had a {adj} lamb";
  std::stringstream ss3(str3);
  ss3 << name << " " << adj << " " // Extract the name and adj
      << str.substr(str.find_last_of(' ') + 1); // Extract the rest of string
  std::cout << ss3.str() << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Now, when this code runs successfully, it prints: "Mary little lamb".
