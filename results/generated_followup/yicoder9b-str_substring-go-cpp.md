The error message is telling us that an expression was expected, but none was provided. This happens because we are trying to use the `cout` with a template string containing `${m}` which is not allowed without a specific compiler flag (`-std=c++11` or above) to enable support for this kind of string formatting.

The fix would be to enclose your code within backticks (` `) in a separate line before calling cout, like so: 
```cpp
cout << R"(Start "DE", length ${m} :)" << substr << endl;
```
This way we are escaping the `${m}` variable and preventing it from causing an error. Now your code should work fine without any issues.
