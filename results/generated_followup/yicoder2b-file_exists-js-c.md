The error you have is related to C programming language, not directly related to any specific software or library. The `fopen()` function and its variations (`fopen()`, `fclose()`, `free()`) are standard functions in the C library which do not exist in the standard system libraries. 

You can solve this problem by including the correct header files (in this case: `stdio.h` for `fopen()/fclose()/free()`) and properly using the right syntax for these functions and variables, in a proper context where they are being used.

Here's how you could fix it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>  /* Include the correct header file */

int main() {
    FILE *file;                   /* Create pointer to file (standard C for file I/O) */
    if ((file = fopen("C:\\input.txt", "r")) == NULL) /* Check if file could be opened */
        printf("Error opening file\n");       /* Output error message if not successful */
    else { 
        /* Process file contents here */     /* Process the file */
        fclose(file);                      /* Close file once done */
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This code will open an input text file named "input.txt" if it exists and is readable, then continue to process its contents, closing the file when finished.

Please note that for the above code to work, you need to replace `C:\\input.txt` with your actual file path as this is just a placeholder. The system has not been tested to ensure it works in any environment or context where the C language and its standard library are being used.
