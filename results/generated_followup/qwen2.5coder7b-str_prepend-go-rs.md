**Error Explanation:** The error occurred because Rust's `let` keyword should not be used to declare mutable variables directly inside a function or at the module level without an appropriate context.

**Fix Explanation:** To fix this, you need to wrap the variable declaration inside a main function or any other suitable code block.

Here's the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("world!");
    s.push_str(", Hello");
    println!("{}", s);
}
```

This code defines a `main` function, which is the entry point of a Rust program. Inside this function, the mutable string variable `s` is declared and initialized with "world!". The `push_str` method appends ", Hello" to the end of `s`, and finally, it prints the updated string.
