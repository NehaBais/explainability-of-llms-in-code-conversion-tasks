The error in the code is that it is missing an indentation for the nested `if` statement after the `for` loop. The error message is indicating that there is an indentation problem on line 3 of the code.
To fix this issue, you need to add an indentation of 4 spaces before the line `if i != num // i:`. This will make the `if` statement part of the `for` loop and ensure that it is properly indented.
Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```py
def factor(num):
 factors = []
 for i in range(1, int(num**0.5) + 1):
 if num % i == 0:
 factors.append(i)
 if i != num // i:
 factors.append(num//i)
 return factors
nums2factor = [2059, 223092870, 3135, 45]
for num in nums2factor:
 print("Factors of", num, "are:", ", ".join(map(str, factor(num))))
```
By adding the indentation for the nested `if` statement, you have fixed the syntax error and made sure that the code is properly formatted. The corrected code will now run without any issues and compute the factors of each integer in the `nums2factor` list correctly.
