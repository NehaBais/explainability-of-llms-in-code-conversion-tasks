The error message indicates that there is an issue with the inclusion of the header file "iostream" in the C++ code. The correct include statement for input/output operations is "#include 
 cin". Additionally, the variables `a` and `b` are declared inside the main function, so they need to be initialized before being used in the if-else statements. Finally, there are a few missing semicolons at the end of some lines.
The fix involves correcting the include statement, initializing the variables `a` and `b`, and adding the missing semicolons. Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a = 0, b = 0;

  cout << "Enter value of a: ";
  cin >> a;

  cout << "Enter value of b: ";
  cin >> b;

  if (a < b) {
    cout << "a is less than b" << endl;
  } else if (a > b) {
    cout << "a is greater than b" << endl;
  } else if (a == b) {
    cout << "a is equal to b" << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
