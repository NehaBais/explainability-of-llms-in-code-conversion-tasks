The error occurs because the Rust code doesn't have a `main` function, which is required for the program to run. The fix is to add a `main` function that calls the `logic` function.

```rust
fn main() {
    logic(true, false);
}

fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
```
