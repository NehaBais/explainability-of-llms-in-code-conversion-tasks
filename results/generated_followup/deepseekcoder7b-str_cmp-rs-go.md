The error message is caused by special characters in the string which is not acceptable in Go language identifiers. The solution to this problem would be to wrap the strings with backticks (` `) as per Go's string literal syntax. 

Here's how you can correct the code:
```go
package main
import ("fmt" "strings")
func main() {
	a := "abc" b := "Bac"
	if a == b { fmt.Println("The strings are equal") } if a != b { fmt.Println("The strings are not equal") } if a > b { fmt.Println("The first string is lexically after the second") } if a < b { fmt.Println("The first string is lexically before the second") }
	upperA := strings.ToUpper(a) upperB := strings.ToUpper(b) 
	if upperA == upperB { fmt.Println("Both strings are equal when ignoring case") } }}
```
