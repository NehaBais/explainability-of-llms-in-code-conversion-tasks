The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the declarations of some functions (`assert_equal`, `computeFactors`, `factor`) and also does not support implicit function declarations. This is because the functions are defined in Rust, which is a language with a compilation model that separates function definition from function use (like C).

To fix this issue, we need to import these function declarations into our C code using the appropriate header files (for example, `assert_equal` can be found in `assert.h`). However, we do not have access to the Rust code and cannot modify it directly.

Alternatively, we can define the functions ourselves in the C code. Here's how I would restructure the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Define an assert_equal function that takes three arguments: a test function, the tested function, and the expected output array
int  assert_equal(int  *(*testFunction)(int), int  *(*testedFunction)(int), int  *expectedOutput) {
  // Call the test function with the tested function as an argument
  int  *computedFactors = (*testFunction)(*testedFunction);

  // Compare the computed factors to the expected output array using a loop
  for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(expectedOutput)/sizeof(expectedOutput[0]); ++i) {
    if (computedFactors[i] != expectedOutput[i]) {
      printf("Expected %d, got %d\n", expectedOutput[i], computedFactors[i]);
      return -1; // Return -1 to indicate a test failure
    }
  }

  printf("All tests passed!\n");
  return 0; // Return 0 to indicate a successful test
}

// Define the sortArray function as an example of how it would be used in C
int  *sortArray(int  *array, int size) {
  // Sort the array using a bubble-sort algorithm (not implemented in this example)

  // Return the sorted array
  return array;
}

// Define the computeFactors function as an example of how it would be used in C
int  *computeFactors(int num) {
  int factorsSize = 0; // Initialize the size of the factors array

  // Compute the factors using a loop (not implemented in this example)
  int  *factors = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*factorsSize);

  // Return the computed factors array
  return factors;
}

// Define the factor function as an example of how it would be used in C
int  *factor(int num) {
  int factorsSize = 0; // Initialize the size of the factors array

  // Compute the factors using a loop (not implemented in this example)
  int  *factors = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*factorsSize);

  // Return the computed factors array
  return factors;
}

// Define the main function as an example of how it would be used in C
int  main() {
  // Call the assert_equal function with the computeFactors and factor functions as test functions and expected output arrays
  int arr1[] = {3, 2};
  int arr2[] = {6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1};

  assert_equal(computeFactors, factor, arr1); // Test case for the computeFactors function
  assert_equal(computeFactors, factor, arr2); // Test case for the factor function

  return 0;
}
```

This is a basic implementation of the `assert_equal` function and how it can be used to test other functions. The `sortArray`, `computeFactors`, `factor`, and `main` functions are examples of how they could be implemented in C using similar logic as the original Rust code.
