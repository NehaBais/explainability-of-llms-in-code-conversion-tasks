 The error is caused by using `let` to declare a global variable that can't be reassigned but it's not expected in this context because Rust doesn't allow mutable global variables without explicitly declaring them with the keyword `mut`.

So, you should use either `const` or `static` instead of `let` for global variables. 

Corrected code:
```rs
const str = "abcdefgh";

// ... rest of your code goes here ...
```
The corrected code is now valid in Rust as it declares the variable with a constant value, which can't be changed after initialization.
