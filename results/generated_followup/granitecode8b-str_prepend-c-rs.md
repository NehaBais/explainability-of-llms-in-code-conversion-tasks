The error message indicates that there are two issues with the code. The first issue is that the type of `c_string_mut` does not match what is expected by the `free` function from the `libc` crate. The second issue is that the `libc` crate is not declared at the top of the file, so it cannot be used in the code.
To fix these issues, we need to declare the `libc` crate and ensure that the type of `c_string_mut` matches what is expected by the `free` function. We can do this by using the `libc::free` function instead of the `std::ptr::null_mut` function.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
use std::ffi::{CStr, CString};
use libc::free;
fn main() {
 let c_string = CString::new("my String").unwrap();
 let mut c_string_mut = unsafe { c_string.as_ptr() as *mut i8 };
 let cstr = CString::new("Changed ").unwrap();
 let new_string = format!("{}{}", cstr.to_str().unwrap(), unsafe {
     CStr::from_ptr(c_string_mut).to_str().unwrap()
 });
 let c_string_new = CString::new(new_string).unwrap();
 unsafe {
     libc::free(c_string_mut as *mut libc::c_void);
 }
 println!("{}", c_string_new.to_str().unwrap());
}
```
In this corrected code, we declare the `libc` crate at the top of the file using the `use libc::free` statement. We also use the `libc::free` function instead of the `std::ptr::null_mut` function to free the memory allocated for `c_string`. The rest of the code remains the same as the original code.
