The error lies on the line `else{console.log("The first string is not lexically before/after the second when ignoring case and it's greater than or equal to the second");};` because there are two consecutive else tokens which is syntactically incorrect in JavaScript. 

One way to fix this would be to remove one of the else tokens. However, if you want to keep both conditions for clarity, use a switch-case structure like so:
```js
  switch (true) {
    case a2 < b2:
      console.log("The first string is lexically before the second when ignoring case");
      break;
    case a2 > b2:
      console.log("The first string is not lexically before/after the second when ignoring case and it's greater than or equal to the second");
      break;
    default: 
      console.log("Both strings are equal when ignoring case"); 
  }
```
