Error: 
The C compiler is unable to find the required header file `<stdio.h>` for the `printf` function, as well as the `stat` function.
Fix: 
Add the following line at the beginning of the program: `#include "stdio.h"`
Corrected code block:
```c
#include "stdio.h"
#include
int main(void) {
  struct stat st;

  if (stat("input.txt", &st) == 0 && S_ISREG(st.st_mode)) {
    printf("File exists and is a regular file.\n");
  } else {
    printf("File does not exist or is not a regular file.\n");
  }

  if (stat("/docs/input.txt", &st) == 0 && S_ISREG(st.st_mode)) {
    printf("File exists and is a regular file in the docs directory.\n");
  } else {
    printf("File does not exist or is not a regular file in the docs "
           "directory.\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: 
The error occurred because the C compiler was unable to find the required header files for the `printf` and `stat` functions. The `#include` directive in the corrected code block ensures that these header files are included in the compilation process, resolving the error.
