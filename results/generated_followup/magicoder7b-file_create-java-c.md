 The error message is indicating that the compiler does not recognize the "mkdir" function, which is used to create directories in C. It's an ISO C99 standard and later versions do not support implicit function declarations like it was done in your code. To fix this issue, we should include the necessary library (stdlib.h) that contains the declaration for the mkdir function. 

Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h> // Include sys types header file to use mkdir() function

int main() {
  FILE *fp;

  // Creating a file "output.txt" in current working directory
  if ((fp = fopen("output.txt", "w")) == NULL) {
    printf("Error opening the file.");
    return 0;
  }
  fclose(fp);

  // Creating a directory "docs" in filesystem root (/)
  int result = mkdir("/docs", 0755);
  if (result != 0) {
    printf("Error creating the directory.");
    return 0;
  }

  // Creating a file "output.txt" in filesystem root (/)
  fp = fopen("/output.txt", "w");
  if (fp == NULL) {
    printf("Error opening the file.");
    return 0;
  }
  fclose(fp);

  // Creating a directory "docs" in current working directory
  result = mkdir("docs", 0755);
  if (result != 0) {
    printf("Error creating the directory.");
    return 0;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
