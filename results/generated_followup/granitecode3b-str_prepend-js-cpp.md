Error:
- The `#include` directive is not valid in C++. To include headers, use the `<header_name>` syntax.
- The `std` namespace is not declared in the global scope. To use its members, prefix them with `std::`.
- The variables `s`, `print`, and `cout` are not defined. To use these functions or objects, prefix them with `std::`.
Fix:
```cpp
#include 
int main() {
  std::string s = "Hello, ";
  s += "World";
  std::cout << s;
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
- The error message indicates that the `#include` directive is not valid in C++. To include headers, use the `<header_name>` syntax. In this case, the header file containing the `string` and `cout` objects is "iostream". Therefore, the correct code should be `#include 
int main() {`.
- The error message also indicates that the `std` namespace is not declared in the global scope. To use its members, prefix them with `std::`. So, instead of using just `string`, use `std::string`. Similarly, replace `print` and `cout` with `std::cout`.
- The error message also indicates that the variables `s`, `print`, and `cout` are not defined. To use these functions or objects, prefix them with `std::`. So, instead of using just `s`, use `std::string s`. Similarly, replace `print` and `cout` with `std::cout`.
