The error mentioned is due to invalid characters U+003F '?' which are not allowed in literals or arguments of printf statements. This could possibly be caused by a syntax error in the C code provided that has been causing the error. 

To fix this error, we can replace `U+003F '?'` with `"yes"` as it is a valid string literal in Go. If the code was written in a language other than C or Golang, you may need to handle these characters differently.

Here is how the corrected code should look:

```c
#include <sys/types.h> 
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/* Check for regular file. */
int check_reg(const char *path) {
	struct stat sb;
	return stat(path, &sb) == 0 && S_ISREG(sb.st_mode);
}

/* Check for directory. */
int check_dir(const char *path) {
	struct stat sb;
	return stat(path, &sb) == 0 && S_ISDIR(sb.st_mode);
}

int main() {
	printf("input.txt is a regular file? %s\n", check_reg("input.txt") ? "yes" : "no");
	printf("docs is a directory? %s\n", check_dir("docs") ? "yes" : "no");
	printf("/input.txt is a regular file? %s\n", check_reg("/input.txt") ? "yes" : "no");
	printf("/docs is a directory? %s\n", check_dir("/docs") ? "yes" : "no");
}
```
