The error occurred because Rust's shift operators only accept unsigned integers, but in this case, `a` is of type `i32`. The cast to `u32` was not sufficient to fix the error because the result of the shift operation is still an `i32`, and `i32` does not have a `try_into()` method. To fix this, we can simply remove the `try_into()` calls and replace them with `.into()` which converts the `i32` to a `u32`. The corrected code looks like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 42;
    let b = 3;

    let left_shift: u32 = (a << b as u32).into();
    let right_shift: u32 = (a >> b as u32).into();
    let arith_right_shift: u32 = (a.wrapping_shr(b as u32)).into();
    let left_rotate: u32 = a.rotate_left((b & 31) as u32);
    let right_rotate: u32 = a.rotate_right((b & 31) as u32);
}
```
