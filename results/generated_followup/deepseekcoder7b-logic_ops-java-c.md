The error message indicates that there are undefined symbols for architecture arm64 - "_main", referenced from initial-undefines. This issue typically happens when we try to compile a C program without defining main function, which is required by the C runtime system. 

To fix this problem, we need to define our own main function:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void logic(bool a, bool b) {
    printf("a AND b: %d\n", (int)a && (int)b);  // cast boolean to int for printing
    printf("a OR b: %d\n", (int)a || (int)b);
    printf("NOT a: %d\n", !(int)a);
}

int main() {
    logic(true, false);  // Call the function with sample inputs.
    return 0;
}
```
