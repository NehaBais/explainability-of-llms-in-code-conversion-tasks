Error: The `#include` directive is used to include header files that define functions or constants needed by the program, but it cannot be used to include external libraries like `sprintf`. To fix this error, simply remove the `#include` directive and replace it with a line that includes the necessary library headers.
Fix: Remove the `#include` directive and add the following lines at the top of your code:
```c
#include
#include
int main() {
  char *extra = "little";
  char new_str[100];
  sprintf(new_str, "Mary had a %s lamb.", extra);
  printf("%s", new_str);
  return 0;
}
```
