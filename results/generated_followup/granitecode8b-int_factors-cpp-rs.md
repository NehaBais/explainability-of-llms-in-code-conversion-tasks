The error message indicates that the `Vec` struct requires generic parameters to be specified when it is defined. In this case, the compiler does not know what type of data the vector will hold, so it throws an error. The fix is to specify the type parameter as `T`, which is a placeholder for any valid Rust type.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
fn generate_factors(n: i32) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut factors = vec![1, n];
    for i in (2..=(n as f64).sqrt().floor() as i32).step_by(1) {
        if n % i == 0 {
            factors.push(i);
            if (i * i) != n {
                factors.push(n / i);
            }
        }
    }
    factors.sort();
    factors
}
```
The corrected code specifies the type parameter for the `Vec` struct as `i32`, indicating that it will hold integers. The function body remains unchanged, and the error should be resolved.
