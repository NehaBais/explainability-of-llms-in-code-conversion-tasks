The error is caused by the use of an implicitly declared class, which is not enabled by default in Java 16. To fix this, we need to add the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling the code.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
// with --enable-preview
String s1 = "Hello";
s1 += ", World!";
System.out.println(s1);
```
This code compiles and runs without any errors, outputting `Hello, World!`.
