The error message indicates that the crate name cannot contain a period (`.`). The solution is to change the crate name from `qwen2.5coder2b_logic_ops_c_rs` to something without periods, such as `qwen2_5coder2b_logic_ops_c_rs`. The corrected code block should look like this:

```rs
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
```
