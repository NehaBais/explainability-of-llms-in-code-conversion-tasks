The error in the JavaScript code is that it tries to use the `` namespace, which is not declared in the global scope. To fix this, we need to include the `` header file before using any of its functions or objects.
The corrected C++ code is shown below:
```cpp
#include
#include
int main() {
  std::filesystem::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
  std::filesystem::rename("c:\\input.txt", "c:\\output.txt");
  std::filesystem::rename("docs", "mydocs");
  std::filesystem::rename("c:\\docs", "c:\\mydocs");
  return 0;
}
```
