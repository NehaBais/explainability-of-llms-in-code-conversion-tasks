The error in the provided Go code is due to an import directive that has been used but not used properly.

In Go, to use a package or module imported by another program, you must import it and then use its contents. If you do not import the "path/filepath" package, it means you are not using any functions from this package. This error occurs when such usage is not present in your code.

To correct this, you should either use or import the required packages (if any) that are needed for your operations. Here, there is no imported package so we cannot use "path/filepath". 

Then you can write your functionality to create files and directories as follows,
```go
func main() {
    /* Create output.txt */
    file, err := os.Create("output.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Failed to create file: %s\n", err)
        return
    }
    defer file.Close()

	/* Create docs/ directory */
	err = os.Mkdir("docs", 0750) // same permissions as in C code
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Failed to create directory: %s\n", err)
		return
	}

    /* Change the mode of created directories */
    _, err = os.Stat("docs/") // stat the file to get its mode
    if err == nil {
        os.Chmod("docs/", 0750) // same permissions as in C code
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("Failed to set directory permissions: %s\n", err)
    }
}
```
