The error message indicates that there are two syntax errors in the given code - 1) an unclosed delimiter on line 3, 2) a missing open bracket for the `find_iter()` method on line 6. The fix is to add the open parenthesis `(`, remove the close parenthesis after `second` in the format string, and enclose the `start()` expression inside parentheses.

The corrected code block is:
```rust
use regex::Regex;

fn match(first: &str, second: &str) {
    println!("1.  {} starts with  {}:  {}", first, second, first.starts_with(second));

    let re = Regex::new(&format!("(?<={}", second)).as_str()).unwrap();
    for cap in re.find_iter(&first).map(|c| c.start() + 1) {
        println!("2.  {} contains  {} at location  {}.", &first, &second, cap);
    }
    
    println!("3.  {} ends with  {}: {}", first, second, first.ends_with(second));
}

fn main()  {
    match("abracadabra", "abr");
}
```

Note that I used the `map()` function to transform each match's starting index into its location in `first` string. This is because we cannot perform arithmetic operations on string indices, so they must be converted to a numeric type before performing arithmetic operations on them.
