**Error Explanation:** The error is due to an invalid character '.' in the crate name `qwen2.5coder7b_logic_ops_c_rs`.

**Fix:** Remove or replace the invalid character in the crate name.

Here's the corrected code:

```rust
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
```
