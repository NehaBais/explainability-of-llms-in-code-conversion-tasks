The error is that the C++ compiler cannot find the "std" header file, which contains the std::rename function. The fix is to include the necessary header file at the beginning of the program using the #include directive.
Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```cpp
#include
#include
int main() {
  std::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
  std::rename("docs", "mydocs");
  std::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
  std::rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
  return 0;
}
```
