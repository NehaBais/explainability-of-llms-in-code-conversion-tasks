The error `/tmp/yicoder2b-int_cmp-java-go.go:10:28: undefined: os` is because you are trying to use the `os` package in Go which is not defined or imported anywhere. Similarly, for the error `/tmp/yicoder2b-int_cmp-java-go.go:14:6: assignment mismatch: 1 variable but reader.Read returns 2 values` and `/tmp/yicoder2b-int_cmp-java-go.go:17:6: assignment mismatch: 1 variable but reader.Read returns 2 values`, it's due to Golang's strict memory safety model which ensures that every variable gets allocated as soon as you declare it. Hence, when you pass the variables to `reader.Read()` function, only one value (the byte stream from user input) is accepted whereas Golang requires all return values (i.e two in this case) because they are part of a buffer or memory allocation which should be allocated every time the function is called. You need to make sure that no variable gets reused by other parts of the program before calling `reader.Read()` for the second and third times.
