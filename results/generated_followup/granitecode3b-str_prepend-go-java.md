Error: The error message indicates that the implicitly declared classes feature is disabled by default in Java. To enable it, use the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling the code.
Fix: To fix this error, add the `--enable-preview` flag to the compilation command.
Rewritten code:
```java
String s = "Hello, world!";
``` 
Note: The corrected code is the same as the original code since the error was caused by a compiler flag rather than a logical issue with the code itself.
