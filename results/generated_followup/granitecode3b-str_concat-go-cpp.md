Error:
- The Golang code includes a syntax error that causes compilation errors.
- The C++ code includes warnings and errors caused by the use of undeclared identifiers and unknown types.
Fix:
- In Golang, the `import "fmt"` statement is required to import the `fmt` package, which provides functions for input/output operations.
- In C++, we must include the `iostream` header file to use the `cout` and `endl` functions.
- In both languages, we must declare the types of variables before using them.
Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
 s := "hello"
 fmt.Println(s)
 s2 := s + " literal"
 fmt.Println(s2)
}
```
