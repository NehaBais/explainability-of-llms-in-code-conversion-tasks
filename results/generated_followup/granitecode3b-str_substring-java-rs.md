The error message indicates that the `main` function is not defined in the crate `granitecode3b_str_substring_java_rs`. The `main` function is required for a Rust program to run, so it needs to be included in the crate definition.
To fix this issue, you need to add a `main` function to your code. Here's how you can rewrite the corrected code:
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
This is just an example of a simple `main` function that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. You can replace it with your own code to perform the desired substring operations.
