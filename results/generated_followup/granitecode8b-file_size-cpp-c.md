The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the file "sys/stat.h" which contains the definition of the struct stat. 
After adding this line, you can rewrite the corrected code in a single code block as follows:
```c
#include 
#include 
void print_file_size(const char *filename) {
  struct stat file_info;
  if (stat(filename, &file_info) != 0) {
    perror("Error getting file size");
    return;
  }

  printf("Size of file %s is %ld bytes.n", filename, (long)file_info.st_size);
}
int main() {
  print_file_size("input.txt");
  print_file_size("/input.txt");
  return 0;
}
```
Note that the code uses the sys/stat.h header file to define the struct stat, so this header needs to be included in order for the code to compile and run correctly. Additionally, the code uses the perror() function from the errno.h header file to print an error message if there is an error getting the file size, so this header also needs to be included.
