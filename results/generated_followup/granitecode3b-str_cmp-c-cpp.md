Error: "error: expected 'FILENAME' or <FILENAME>" - The error message indicates that there is an issue with the file name that is being included in the C++ code. To fix this, the correct file name should be enclosed in either single quotes ('') or double quotes ("). In this case, the file name is "granitecode3b-str_cmp-c-cpp.cpp", so it should be corrected to include quotation marks around the file name.
Fix: Replace " granitecode3b-str_cmp-c-cpp.cpp" with "".
Corrected code:
```
#include ""
using namespace std;
int main() {
  string a = "ball", b = "bell";
  cout << left << setw(20) << "a" << setw(10) << "STREQ(a,b)" << setw(10) << STREQ(a, b);
  cout << left << setw(20) << a << setw(10) << STREQ(a, b) << setw(10) << STRLT(a, b);
  cout << left << setw(20) << a << setw(10) << STREQ(a, b) << setw(10) << STRLE(a, b) << endl;
}
``` 
Note: The corrected code includes the necessary #include statements and uses the correct syntax for including files in C++.
