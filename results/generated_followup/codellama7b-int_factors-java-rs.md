Error: The `main` function is not found in the crate, which means that it was not properly defined or linked.

Fix: Add the `main` function to the code, which will serve as the entry point for the program. This can be done by defining a new function with the same name and signature as the original function, but without any parameters or return types.

Corrected code:
```rs
use std::collections::TreeSet;

fn factors(n: u64) -> TreeSet<u64> {
    let mut factors = TreeSet::new();
    factors.insert(n);
    factors.insert(1);

    for test in (2..=((n as f64).sqrt() as u64)).rev() {
        if n % test == 0 {
            factors.insert(test);
            factors.insert(n / test);
        }
    }

    return factors;
}

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
