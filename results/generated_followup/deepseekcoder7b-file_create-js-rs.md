The error occurs because `fs::File::create()` does not return a File object, but rather returns either an instance of Result or an enumeration variant indicating whether the operation was successful (Ok) or failed (Err). Therefore, you cannot call unwrap_or_else directly on it. The fix involves calling .unwrap_or_else() on the result of fs::File::create().
The s in unwrap_or_else is a typo and should be removed to make the corrected code block valid Rust syntax. The correct version of the corrected code block would look like this:
```rs
use std::env;
use std::fs;
use std::io::Error;

fn handle_error(e: &Error) 
{
    println!("{}", e);
}

fn main() 
{
    let dir = match env::current_dir() 
    {
        // Get current directory
        Ok(path) => path,
        Err(e) => 
        {
            handle_error(&e);
            return;
         }
     };

    // Create "output.txt" in the current working directory and docs folder
    fs::File::create(&dir.join("output.txt")).unwrap_or_else(|e| handle_error(&e));
    fs::File::create(&dir.join("docs/file.txt")).unwrap_or_else(|e| handle_error(&e));
}
```
This code creates a file named "output.txt" in the current working directory and "file.txt" inside a folder called "docs". Rust does not directly allow to specify root ("/") for file operations like Javascript does with its fs module, so instead we use `env::current_dir()` which gives us the path of the current working directory.
