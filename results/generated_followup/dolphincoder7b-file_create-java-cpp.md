The error message is: "no member named 'filesystem' in namespace  'std'"

This error arises because the C++ standard library does not have any support for file system operations like creating a new directory or deleting a file. To address this, you can use the Boost libraries that provide these functionalities. 

The fix is to include the necessary headers from the "filesystem" and "fstream" libraries of the Boost library. 

Below is the corrected C++ code:
```cpp
#include  <iostream>
#include  <boost/filesystem.hpp>
namespace fs = boost::filesystem;
int main() {
  try  {
    // create new empty file "output.txt" of size 0 bytes in CWD
    std::ofstream("output.txt").close();

    // create new empty file "output.txt" of size 0 bytes in FSR
    std::ofstream("/output.txt").close();

    // create an empty directory called "docs" in CWD
    fs::create_directory("docs");

    // create an empty directory called "docs" in FSR
    fs::create_directory("/docs");
   } catch  (std::exception &e)  {
    std::cerr << e.what()  << '\n';
   }
}
```
