The error message indicates that there are some syntax issues with the `return` statement, specifically undeclared identifiers 'begin▁of▁sentence｜' and 'i'. These symbols don't seem to be valid in a return statement according to C++ syntax rules. The corrected code can simply return 0 as it is the standard way of indicating successful termination of program execution in main function.

Here is the correct code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int a, b;
  std::cin >> a >> b;

  if(a < b)
    std::cout << a << " is less than " << b << std::endl;

  if(a == b)
    std::cout << a << " is equal to " << b << std::endl;

  if(a > b)
    std::cout << a << " is greater than " << b << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
