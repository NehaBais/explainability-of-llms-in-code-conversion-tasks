The error occurs because the first line of the code is missing the `package` declaration, which specifies the name of the package that contains the code. In Go, every source file must be part of a package, and the package name must match the directory name where the file is located. Since the file is in a temporary directory, it does not have a valid package name.
To fix this error, you need to add a `package main` declaration at the top of the file to specify that the code belongs to the `main` package. This will allow the code to be compiled and run correctly.
Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main
func Substring(str string, n, m int) string {
 return str[n : n+m]
}
func Substring(str string, n int) string {
 return str[n:]
}
func Substring(str string) string {
 return str[:len(str)-1]
}
func Substring(str string, c byte, m int) string {
 i := strings.IndexByte(str, c)
 if i == -1 {
 return ""
 }
 return str[i : i+m+1]
}
func Substring(str string, sub string, m int) string {
 i := strings.Index(str, sub)
 if i == -1 {
 return ""
 }
 return str[i : i+m+1]
}
```
Note that the `package main` declaration is required only when compiling the code outside of a package. If you are running the code from within a package, you can omit this declaration.
