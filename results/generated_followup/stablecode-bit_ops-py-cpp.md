Error explanation:
The error occurred because there were multiple errors, each breaking one of the syntax rules of C++, resulting in a total of 20 errors generated.

Fix explanation:
To fix this issue, we need to address all the errors generated individually and resolve them properly. However, based on the provided code snippet, it seems that the intention was to perform bitwise operations, but there were multiple syntax errors encountered during compilation. To provide you with a corrected version of the code, I will first analyze the given code snippet and fix the syntax errors individually before providing the corrected code block.

Corrected code block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

int main() {
    unsigned int a = 10;
    unsigned int b = 15;
    unsigned int width = 3;
    const unsigned int mask = 0b11111; // Mask with bit values up to the specified width

    std::cout << "and(" 
                        << bitset<32>(a)).to_string() 
                      << ", " 
                      << bitset<32>(b)).to_string() 
                      << ") = 0b" 
                      << bitset<32>((a & b) & mask)).to_string() << std::endl;

    std::cout << "or(" 
                        << bitset<32>(a)).to_string() 
                      << ", " 
                      << bitset<32>(b)).to_string() 
                      << ") = 0b" 
                      << bitset<32>((a | b) & mask)).to_string() << std::endl;

    std::cout << "xor(" 
                        << bitset<32>(a)).to_string() 
                      << ", " 
                      << bitset<32>(b)).to_string() 
                      << ") = 0b" 
                      << bitset<32>((a ^ b) & mask)).to_string() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
