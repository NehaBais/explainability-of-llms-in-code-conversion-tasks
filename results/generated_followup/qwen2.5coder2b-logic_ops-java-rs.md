The error is caused by Rust's syntax for crate names. It must begin with a letter, followed by any alphanumeric characters or underscores. "qwen2.5coder2b_logic_ops_java_rs" is not a valid crate name because it contains periods which are invalid in Rust.

To fix the issue, we simply need to change the crate name to something that follows Rust's naming convention. We can use "logic_ops" as the new crate name:

```rs
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}

fn main() {
    logic(true, false); // Outputs: a AND b: false, a OR b: true, NOT a: true
}
```
