Error: The code contains several errors related to syntax, undefined identifiers, missing function declarations, and extraneous parentheses.

Fix: 
To fix these errors, we need to make the following changes in the code:
Remove the line `#include <filename>math.h>`. This line is already included by default when compiling C code.

This fixed code block ensures that the undefined identifiers and extraneous parentheses have been resolved. Additionally, the code is now easier to read and understand.
