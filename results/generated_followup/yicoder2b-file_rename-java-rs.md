Sure, let's convert this Java code to Rust:

Here is the equivalent Rust code:
```rust
use std::io;
use std::process;

fn main() {
    let oldname = "input.txt".to_string();
    let newname = "output.txt".to_string();

    if rename_file(&oldname, &newname) {
        println!("The file {} was renamed as {}", oldname, newname);
    } else {
        println!("The file {} could not be renamed into {}", oldname, newname);
    }

    let oldname = "docs".to_string();
    let newname = "mydocs".to_string();
    if rename_file(&oldname, &newname) {
        println!("The directory {} was renamed as {}", oldname, newname);
    } else {
        println!("The directory {} could not be renamed into {}", oldname, newname);
    }
}

fn rename_file(oldname: &str, newname: &str) -> bool {
    let file = std::fs::File::new(oldname)?;
    let file2 = std::fs::File::new(newname)?;
    if let Err(_e) = file.rename(&mut file2) {
        println!("The file could not be renamed into {}", newname);
        return false;
    }
    true
}
```

Note: In Rust, it's generally better to handle errors explicitly with `?` operator which returns the value wrapped in Option type. Also, `println!()` does not return a value and if any error is thrown, it will be caught by the `Option::unwrap()` method. This way we ensure that our code does not proceed to other operations if an error occurred during renaming.

The first line of the Rust program prints out messages indicating whether or not the file was renamed successfully. If there's a problem with either renaming operation, it will print an error message to standard output. The second and third lines of the program rename `docs` into `mydocs`. This time, if any errors occur during the renaming operation, it is caught and printed out to standard output for clarity.
