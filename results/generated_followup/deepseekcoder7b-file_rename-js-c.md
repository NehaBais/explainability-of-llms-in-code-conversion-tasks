The error message indicates that there are some syntax errors in the program. These seem to be related to Unicode characters not being allowed as part of an identifier, which would likely cause a compilation error. The line `return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜ 0;` is causing issues because it's using Unicode character identifiers rather than C language syntax.

The fix for this problem could involve removing the Unicode characters and replacing them with valid C code, such as returning an integer value.

Here is the corrected single-line code block:
```c
return 0;
```
