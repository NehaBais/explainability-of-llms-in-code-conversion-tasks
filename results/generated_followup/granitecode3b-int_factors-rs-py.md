The error message indicates that there is an indentation issue with the Python code enclosed in backticks. The `range` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to the square root of the number, and the `//` operator is used to calculate the floor division of the number by each factor. However, the error message suggests that there may be an issue with indentation when using these functions.
To fix this issue, you need to indent the code inside the `for` loop correctly. Here's the corrected code in a single fenced code block:
```python
def factor(num):
 factors = []
 for i in range(1, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
 if num % i == 0:
 factors.append(i)
 factors.append(num // i)
 factors.sort()
 return factors
```
By indenting the code inside the `for` loop correctly, you ensure that the code is executed properly and the error is resolved.
