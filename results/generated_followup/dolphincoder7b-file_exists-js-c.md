The error message is: "fatal error: 'io.h' file not found". This means that the system cannot find the io.h library to compile the C code. The fix is to add `#include <stdio.h>` at the top of the C program, which will tell the compiler to look for stdio.h instead.

Here's the corrected code block:
```c
#include  <stdio.h>
#include  <io.h>
#include  <iostream>

int main() {
  int file1 = _access("input.txt", 0);
  int file2 = _access("c:/input.txt", 0);
  int dir1 = _access("docs", 0);
  int dir2 = _access("c:/docs", 0);

  std::cout << "File exists: " << (file1 != -1) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "File exists: " << (file2 != -1) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Directory exists: " << (dir1 != -1) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Directory exists: " << (dir2 != -1) << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
