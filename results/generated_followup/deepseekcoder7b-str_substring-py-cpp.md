The error message is indicating that there are some special characters not allowed in identifier names, which is causing syntax errors during compilation. The code snippet has to return the size of string `s` which can be done using `size()` function provided by `std::string`. Here's how it should look:

```cpp
return s.size();
``` 

This line of C++ code will return the number of characters in the string `s`. The original error message had some special unicode characters, which were not allowed in identifier names and hence causing a syntax error during compilation.
