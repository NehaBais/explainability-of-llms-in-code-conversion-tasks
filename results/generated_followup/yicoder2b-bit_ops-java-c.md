The error "expected expression" suggests that there is no expression present after 'a >>> b'. This line of code does not appear to have any operation performed in it, so a syntax error would occur if this line were part of the program. 

In C, you generally do not need to include specific libraries for bitwise operations like Java. However, the standard library provides functionality to perform these operations on integers using the '&', '|', '^', and '~' operators. You can then print the result of each operation as required. 

Here is how the equivalent C code would look:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
  
void bitwise(int a, int b) {
    // Bitwise AND of two integers
    printf("a AND b: %d\n", a & b);
  
    // Bitwise OR of two integers
    printf("a OR b: %d\n", a | b);
  
    // Bitwise XOR of two integers
    printf("a XOR b: %d\n", a ^ b);

    // Bitwise NOT of first integer
    printf("NOT a: %d\n", ~a);

    // Left shift of the first integer with respect to the second integer
    printf("a << b: %d\n", a << b);

    // Arithmetic right shift of the first integer with respect to the second
    // integer
    printf("a >> b: %d\n", a >> b);
  
    // Logical right shift of the first integer with respect to the second integer
    printf("a >>> b: %d\n", a >>> b);
}
```
