The error message indicates that the Rust compiler is looking for a `main` function in the code, but it does not find one. The `main` function is used to specify the entry point of a Rust program, so it is required for the code to compile and run successfully. To fix this issue, you need to add a `main` function to the code that calls the `print_logic` function with appropriate arguments.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
fn main() {
    print_logic(true, false);
}

fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
```
This code defines the `main` function that calls the `print_logic` function with logical values `true` and `false`.
