**Error Explanation:** The error indicates that there is an invalid character `'.'` in the crate name, which violates Rust's naming conventions.

**Fix Explanation:** Remove any non-alphanumeric characters from the crate name to ensure it adheres to Rust's requirements.

Here is the corrected code:

```rs
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
```

This function takes two boolean arguments (`a` and `b`) and prints out whether their "and", "or" result, and negation are true or false.
