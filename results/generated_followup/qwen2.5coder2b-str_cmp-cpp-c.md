The error message indicates that the compiler is expecting two arguments to the `stricmp` function, but it received only one. This is due to incorrect usage of the `strcasecmp` function in the `demo_compare` function.

To fix this, we need to pass three arguments to `strcmp`. However, since `stricmp` does not support this format, we can use the `strcoll` function instead, which returns a negative value if the first string is less than the second, a positive value if it is greater, and zero if they are equal.

Here's the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

void demo_compare(const char *a, const char *b, const char *semantically) {
    int result = strcoll(a, b);
    printf("%s\n", result == 0 ? "Equal" : (result < 0 ? "A before B" : "B before A"));
}

int main() {
    double numA = strtod("1.2", NULL);
    double numB = strtod("1.3", NULL);
    demo_compare(numA, numB, "numerically");
    return 0;
}
```

This code now uses the `strcoll` function to compare two strings and prints whether they are equal, A before B, or B before A.
