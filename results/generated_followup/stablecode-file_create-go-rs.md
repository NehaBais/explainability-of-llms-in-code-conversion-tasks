The error in a single line is: `error: mismatched closing delimiter: `)``.
Fix: To fix this, we need to ensure that each opening delimiter has its corresponding closing delimiter. In the Rust code above, there are two mistakes:
1. There's an extra closing brace `}` in the create_file function call at line 15. We just remove it and everything will work fine.
2. Similar issue is present on line 16 where we are trying to close a parenthesis that isn't open yet. We need to ensure that all opening delimiters have their corresponding closing delimiters. In this case, we need to add an opening parenthesis `(` before the format!() string interpolation expression at line 16.
Here's the corrected code:
```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn create_file(file_path: &str) {
    let mut file = fs::File::create(file_path).expect("Failed to create file");
}

fn create_dir(dir_path: &str) {
    fs::create_dir_all(dir_path).expect("Failed to create directory");
}

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let root_path = std::env::var("ROOT").unwrap();

    create_file(&format!("{}/input.txt", root_path)));
    create_file(&format!("{}/input.txt", "/")));
    create_dir(&format!("{}/docs", root_path)));
    create_dir(&format!("{}/docs", "/")));

    Ok(())
}
```
