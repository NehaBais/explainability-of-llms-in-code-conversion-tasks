 The error is saying that we cannot move out of `*factors`, because it's behind a mutable reference, which means we cannot take ownership of it. It also suggests to implement Clone for Factors struct if needed. 

Here is the corrected version:
```rs
use std::vec::Vec;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Factors {
    list: Vec<i32>,
}

impl Factors {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Factors { list: vec![] }
    }

    fn transfer(&mut self, flist: &Vec<i32>) {
        for &value in flist.iter() {
            self.list.push(value);
        }
    }
}

fn factor(num: i32, factors: &mut Factors) -> &Factors {
    let mut flist = vec![];
    let mut dvsr = 1;
    while dvsr * dvsr < num {
        if num % dvsr != 0 {
            dvsr += 1;
            continue;
        }
        flist.push(dvsr);
        flist.push(num / dvsr);
    }
    if dvsr * dvsr == num {
        flist.push(dvsr);
    }
    factors.transfer(&flist);
    &factors
}

fn main() {
    let mut nums2factor = vec![2059, 223092870, 3135, 45];
    let mut ftors = Factors::new();
    for i in 0..nums2factor.len() {
        factor(nums2factor[i], &mut ftors);
        println!("factors of {} are: {:?}", nums2factor[i], ftors.list);
        ftors.list.clear();
    }
}
```
The fix was to use `&factors` instead of `*factors`, which allows us to return a reference to the Factors object without trying to take ownership of it.
