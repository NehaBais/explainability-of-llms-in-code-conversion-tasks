The error is `can't call method 'rev' on type 'i64'`. This occurs because Rust cannot determine the upper bound for the loop due to the condition being dependent on the variable `n`.

To fix this, we can provide an upper bound for the loop by directly using the square root of `n` as the upper bound. Additionally, we should remove the unnecessary parsing and conversion operations.

Here is the corrected code:
```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;

fn factors(n: i64) -> HashSet<i64> {
    let mut factors = HashSet::new();
    factors.insert(1);

    let sqrt_n = (n as f64).sqrt() as i64;

    for test in 2..=sqrt_n {
        if n % test == 0 {
            factors.insert(test);
            factors.insert(n / test);
        }
    }
    return factors;
}
```
In this corrected code, we have removed the unnecessary conversion operations and directly used `f64` to calculate the square root of `n`. Then, we iterated from 2 up to the calculated square root of `n`, checking if `n` is divisible by the current test value. If it is divisible, we added both the test value and its corresponding quotient to the set of factors.
