The error occurs because C++ does not have built-in support for handling file operations like renaming files or directories using `std::filesystem` namespace, which is part of the C++17 standard library. To fix this issue, we can use the `<filesystem>` header from the C++ standard library to provide compatibility with the `rename` and `filesystem::rename` functions in Java. 

Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include  <cstdlib>
#include  <filesystem>
#include  <iostream>

int main() {
  try  {
    // rename a file
    std::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");

    // rename a directory
    std::filesystem::rename("docs", "mydocs");
  } catch (const std::exception &e)  {
    std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << '\n';
  }
}
```

In this revised version of the code, we include the `<filesystem>` header and use `std::rename` and `std::filesystem::rename` functions to perform file operations in C++.
