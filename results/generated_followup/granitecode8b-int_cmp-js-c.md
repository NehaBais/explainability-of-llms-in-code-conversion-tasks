The error in the code is that it does not include the necessary header files for `printf` and `scanf`, as well as the main function. The fix is to add these missing elements to the code, and rewrite the code in a single code block. Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include 
int main() {
 int a, b;
 printf("Enter two integers:");
 scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

 if (a == b) {
 printf("%d equals %d
");
 } else if (a < b) {
 printf("%d is less than %d
");
 } else {
 printf("%d is greater than %d
");
 }

 return 0;
}
```
In this corrected code, we have added the necessary header files for `printf` and `scanf`, as well as the main function. We also used the correct comparison operators `<`, `==`, and `>` instead of `<=`, `>=`, and `===`. Finally, we have rewritten the code in a single code block, making it easier to read and understand.
