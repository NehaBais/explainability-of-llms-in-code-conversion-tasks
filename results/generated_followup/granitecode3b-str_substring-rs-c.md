The error occurred because the `#include` directive is not supported in C. To fix this, you can use `<iostream>` instead of `"iostream"`.
The other errors occurred because the `std::` prefix was not used for the `string`, `cout`, and `substr` functions, which are part of the standard library in C++. To fix these, you need to use the appropriate namespaces.
Here's the corrected code:
```c++
#include 
#include 
int main() {
  std::string s = "abcletters";
  std::cout << s.substr(0, 3) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This code creates a string `s` with the value `"abcletters"` and outputs the first three characters of `s` using `cout`.
