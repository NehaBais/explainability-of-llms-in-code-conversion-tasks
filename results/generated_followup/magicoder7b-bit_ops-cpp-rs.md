 The errors occur because Rust does not implicitly convert between different numerical types - `i32` (signed int) and `u32` (unsigned int). When you try to perform an operation with these two types, the compiler complains about it. In the C++ code provided, all operations are well-defined because of implicit type conversion.

The fix is straightforward: Instead of trying to print a signed integer (`i32`) and an unsigned integer (`u32`), you should ensure that both operands are of the same type. You can do this by converting `a` to `u32`, like so:

```rs
fn bitwise(a: i32, b: u32) {
    print!("a and b: ");
    println!("{}", a as u32 & b);

    print!("a or b:  ");
    println!("{}", a as u32 | b);

    print!("a xor b: ");
    println!("{}", a as u32 ^ b);

    print!("not a:   ");
    println!("{}", !a);

    let shift_amount = b; // b is already unsigned, so no need for conversion here.

    print!("a shl b: ");
    println!("{}", (a as u32 << shift_amount) & 0xffffffff);

    print!("a shr b: ");
    println!("{}", a as u32 >> shift_amount); // right-shift (arithmetic)

    let mut ua = a as u32; // convert signed int to unsigned int

    print!("a lsr b: ");
    println!("{}", (ua >> shift_amount) & 0xffffffff); // logical right-shift and mask to 32 bits

    ua = a as u32; // reset to original value for right rotate

    print!("a ror b: ");
    println!("{}", ua.rotate_right(b)); // Rust's built-in rotate function
}
```
This code should compile and run fine. It performs the operations in the same way as your C++ code, but it takes into account that Rust doesn't implicitly convert between different numerical types.
