 The error is occurring because Rust does not support negative step values. The `step_by` function cannot take a negative value and thus leads to an error, since we are trying to use it to iterate in reverse from the maximum possible unsigned integer (`usize::MAX`). 

To fix this error, you can simply change the loop to iterate in reverse order by setting step to `-1`. Here is how your corrected code would look:

```rs
use std::collections::HashSet;

fn factors(n: i64) -> HashSet<i64> {
    let mut factors = HashSet::new();
    factors.insert(n);
    factors.insert(1);
    for test in (2..n).step_by(-1) {
        if n % test == 0 {
            factors.insert(test);
            factors.insert(n / test);
        }
    }
    return factors;
}
```
