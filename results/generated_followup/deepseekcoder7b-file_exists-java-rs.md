The error message is indicating that `path` cannot be borrowed as mutable because it's not declared as such. This occurs due to the immutability rules of Rust. 

The fix for this issue would be to declare `path` as mutable with `let mut path = PathBuf::from("/");` and then push the filename onto that path in a subsequent line. The corrected code is:

```rs
use std::fs;
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

fn exists_in_current_dir(filename: &str) -> bool {
    let path = Path::new(filename);
    path.exists() && path.is_file() // or .is_dir() for directory check
}

fn exists_in_root(filename: &str) -> bool {
    let mut path = PathBuf::from("/"); 
    path.push(filename);  
    
    match fs::metadata(path) {
        Ok(_) => true,  
        Err(_) => false, 
    }
}

fn main() {
    assert!(exists_in_current_dir("input.txt"));
    assert!(exists_in_current_dir("docs"));
    assert!(exists_in_root("input.txt"));
    assert!(exists_in_root("docs"));
}
```
