Error: The `main` function is not found in the crate, which means that it was not declared or defined anywhere in the code.

Fix: Add a `main` function to the code, for example by adding the following line at the end of the file: `fn main() {}`. This will tell Rust that there is a top-level entry point to the program and allow it to compile successfully.

Corrected code:
```rs
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("{}", a && b); // prints the result of "and" operation on both args
    println!("{}", a || b); // prints the result of "or" operation on both args
    println!("{}", !a); // prints the result of "not" operation on first arg
}

fn main() {}
```
