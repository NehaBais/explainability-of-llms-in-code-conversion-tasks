The error message indicates that there is no `main` function declared in your Rust program, which is required by Rust's standard executable entry point convention. To fix this issue, we need to add a `main` function as follows:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 10;  // For example
    let b = 2;   // and so on...
    bitwise(a, b);
    println!("a rol b: {}", rotate_left(a, b));
    println!("a ror b: {}", rotate_right(a, b));
}
```

And the corrected function definitions with `bitwise` and `rotate_left/right` are in the question.
