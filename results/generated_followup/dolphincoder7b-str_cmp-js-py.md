The error occurred because the `===` operator was used incorrectly inside the fenced code block. In JavaScript, strict equality is represented by two equals signs (`==`), whereas in Python, it's represented by three equals signs (`===`). The corrected code now uses the correct comparison operator (`===`) for case sensitive comparisons between strings.

Here is the corrected code:
```py
# Case sensitive comparison
print('abcd' == 'abcd')  # True
print('abcd' === 'abcd')  # True
print(123 == '123')   # True
print(123 === '123')   # False
print('ABCD' == 'abcd')   # False
```
