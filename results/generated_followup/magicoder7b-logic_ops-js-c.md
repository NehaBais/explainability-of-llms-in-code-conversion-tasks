The error occurs because the linker cannot find the entry point to your program which is named "main". In C language, every application must have a function named main() (or equivalent) that acts as an entry point for the execution of the program.

In your case, you haven't defined a main function which is why linker is not able to find it and resulting in the error. The fix would be defining the main function as described above. Here is the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void logic(int a, int b) {
  printf("a AND b: %d\n", a && b);
  printf("a OR b: %d\n", a || b);
  printf("NOT a: %d\n", !a);
}

int main(void) {
  logic(1, 0); // Call your function with example arguments.
  return 0;
}
```
Now this should compile and run correctly.
