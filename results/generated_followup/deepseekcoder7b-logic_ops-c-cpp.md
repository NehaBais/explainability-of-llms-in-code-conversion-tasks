The error occurs because there is no `main` function declared as per standard C++ program structure, which is essential for executing any C++ program. The linker (ld) cannot find a definition of '_main' during linking phase. 

The fix for the error would be to declare a main function where you can call your print_logic function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void print_logic(bool a, bool b) {
    cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << endl;
    cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << endl;
    cout << "not a is " << !a << endl;
}

int main() {
    bool a = true, b = false; // Test values
    print_logic(a, b); 
    return 0;
}
```
