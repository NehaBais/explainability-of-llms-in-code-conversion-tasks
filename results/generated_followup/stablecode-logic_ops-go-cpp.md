The error "Undefined symbols for architecture arm64" occurs when there are missing symbols or libraries required by the linker to create an executable.

To fix this error, we need to ensure that all necessary libraries and headers are included in the compilation command.

Here is the corrected C++ code:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;

void printLogic(bool a, bool b) {
  cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << endl;
  cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << endl;
  cout << "not a is " << !a << endl;
}

int main() {
  bool a = true;
  bool b = false;
  printLogic(a, b);
  return 0;
}
```
In this code block, the `main` function initializes two boolean variables `a` and `b`. The `printLogic` function is then called with these variables as arguments.

The corrected code should compile without any linker errors or undefined symbol warnings.
