The error is because Java does not support implicitly declared classes. The `String` class is a built-in class provided by the Java language. Therefore, it does not require to be explicitly declared.

Here's the corrected code in a single code block:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "world!";
        s = "Hello, " + s;
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```

This code will output `"Hello, world!"` when run.
