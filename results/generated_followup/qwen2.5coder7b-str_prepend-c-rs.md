**Error Explanation:** The error is due to an invalid character in the crate name. Rust crate names cannot contain version numbers or periods.

**Fix:** Remove the version number from the crate name.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut str = String::from("my String");
    let cstr = "Changed ";
    
    str = format!("{}{}", cstr, &str);
    
    println!("{}", str);
}
```
