The error is caused by the fact that `sprintf` expects the first argument to be of type `char*`, but `std::string` is not implicitly convertible to `char*` in C++. The fix is to use the `c_str()` method of the `std::string` class to get a null-terminated character array that can be passed to `sprintf`.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::string str = "Mary had a %s lamb";
  std::string txt = "little";
  std::cout << sprintf(str.c_str(), txt) << std::endl;
}
```
