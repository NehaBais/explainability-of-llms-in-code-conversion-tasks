The error occurs because C++ requires parentheses around lambda function as it's not considered as an operator() by default. Also, C++ doesn't have a built-in case insensitive string comparison like Golang `strings.EqualFold` does. The issue is fixed when we include the parentheses and change the lambda to `(char a, char b) { return std::tolower(static_cast<unsigned char>(a)) == std::tolower(static_cast<unsigned char>(b)); }`.

Corrected code:
```cpp
#include <algorithm> 
#include <iostream> 
#include <string> 

int main() { 
    // Case sensitive comparison of strings
    std::string c = "cat";
    std::string d = "dog";

    if(c == d) {
        std::cout << c << " is equal to " << d << '\n';
    } else {
        std::cout << c << " is not equal to " << d << '\n';
    } 
    
    // Case insensitive comparison of strings.  
    if(std::equal(c.begin(), c.end(), d.begin(), [](char a, char b) { return std::tolower(static_cast<unsigned char>(a)) == std::tolower(static_cast<unsigned char>(b)); })){
        std::cout << "Case-insensitive: strings are equal" << '\n'; 
    } else {
        std::cout << "Case-insensitive: strings are not equal" << '\n';  
    } 
    
    return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>0; // C++20 allows to write return 0 instead of return 0; in main function. Both works the same. It's just a personal preference on who writes what. You can choose one based upon your comfort level!
}
