The error `Undefined symbols for architecture arm64: _main, referenced from:` indicates that there is an undefined symbol (`_main`) for the ARM64 architecture.

To fix this error, you need to make sure that all necessary files are included during the compilation process. Additionally, you should ensure that you are compiling for the correct architecture (ARM64 in this case)).

Here is the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void compare(int a, int b) {
  if (a == b) {
    printf("%d equals %d\n", a, b);
  } else if (a < b) {
    printf("%d is less than %d\n", a, b));
  } else if (a > b)) {
    printf("%d is greater than %d\n", a, b));
  }
}
```

This corrected code will properly compare two integers and display the appropriate message based on their relationship.
