Error: The `main` function is not found in the crate. 
Fix: Add a `main` function to the code and call it with the appropriate arguments.
Rewritten Code:
```rust
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}

fn main() {
    print_logic(true, true); // Example usage
}
```
Explanation: The error was caused because the `main` function was not defined in the crate. To fix this, we added a new `main` function to the code and called it with the appropriate arguments. This caused the program to compile successfully and produce the expected output.
