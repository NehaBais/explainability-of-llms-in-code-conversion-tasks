Error: The code is trying to use the `strcat` function, which is not supported by C. It requires the `<string.h>` header file to be included.
Fix: Add `#include <string.h>` at the beginning of the code to include the necessary header file with the `strcat` function declaration.
Corrected Code:
```c
#include <string.h>
int main() {
  char s[] = "Hello";
  strcat(s, ", World");
  printf("%s", s);
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the `strcat` function is not supported by C. To fix this issue, we included the `<string.h>` header file at the beginning of the code to provide the necessary function declaration and implementation. This ensures that the program compiles without any errors.
