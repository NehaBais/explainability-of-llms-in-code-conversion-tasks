The error message indicates that the C++ compiler does not recognize the `std::filesystem` namespace, which provides file system access. It is an optional part of C++17 standard library and it needs to be enabled while compiling the program. 

To fix this issue you should use either a feature-test macro (like __has_include) or enable support for c++17 filesystem in your compiler flags.
In this case, it's necessary to check if your compiler supports c++17 filesystem or not. If it does, the #define HAS_STD_FILESYSTEM 1 allows you to compile and run the code that uses `std::filesystem`. Otherwise, an error is thrown indicating that the system doesn’t support the C++17 filesystem library.
Please note that this will work for gcc and clang versions from 4.8 onwards as they have supported c++17 filesystem since then. For other compilers (like Microsoft Visual Studio) you need to define VC_EXTRALEAN before including <filesystem> and undefine it afterwards, because the standard library headers may cause conflicts with other libraries.

Note: Replace `<s` with your compiler version number (e.g., 4800 for gcc 4.8). Also, if you’re on MSVC and it doesn't support C++17 filesystem as mentioned above, you might have to use Boost Filesystem library instead of `std::filesystem`.
