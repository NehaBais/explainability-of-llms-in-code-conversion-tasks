This error message suggests that there is no main function defined for a Rust project, which is required when compiling Rust code. 

Rust doesn't require main functions in every program. Instead, the entry point of the program is often specified using the `run` or `main` function at the top-level of your program. Here's how you could write the given Golang function in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = true;
    let b = false;

    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
```
