Error: The code contains an unmatched parenthesis. 

Fix: To fix this error, we need to ensure that all parentheses are properly matched. In this case, we have a missing closing parenthesis in the input statement. To fix this issue, we can add a closing parenthesis after "Enter the second integer: ".

Corrected code:
```python
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: ")))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: ")))))
print(f"{a} + {b} = {a+b}")
print(f"{a} - {b} = {a-b}")
print(f"{a} * {b} = {a*b}")
print(f"{a} // {b} = {a//b}")  # truncates towards negative infinity
print(f"{a} %% {b} = {a%b}")  # same sign as first operand
```
