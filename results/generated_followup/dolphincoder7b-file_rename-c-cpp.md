The error occurs because C++ does not have the `rename` function available as a built-in function. Therefore, we need to import the `iostream` library by adding `#include <iostream>` at the beginning of the program. Additionally, we can use `std::rename` instead of `rename`, which is part of the `std` namespace in C++. The corrected code looks like this:

```cpp
#include 
#include 

using namespace std;

int main() {
  rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
  rename("docs", "mydocs");
  rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
  rename("/docs", "/mydocs");

  return 0;
}
```

The error occurred because of the `rename` function being called without importing the library first, resulting in a compile-time error. The fix is to include the appropriate `#include <iostream>` statement at the beginning of the program and use `std::rename` instead of `rename`. This ensures that the program can successfully compile and execute the required rename operations.
