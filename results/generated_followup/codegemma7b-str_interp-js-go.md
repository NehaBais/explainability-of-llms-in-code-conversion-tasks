**Error:** The code is missing the package declaration at the beginning.

**Fix:** Add `package main` to the beginning of the code.

**Corrected Code:**

```go
package main

import "strings"
import "fmt"

func main() {
	original := "Mary had a X lamb"
	little := "little"
	replaced := strings.Replace(original, "X", little, -1) // -1 means replace all occurrences
	fmt.Println(replaced) // Output: Mary had a little lamb
}
```
