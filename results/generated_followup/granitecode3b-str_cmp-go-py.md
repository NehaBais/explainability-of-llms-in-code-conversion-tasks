The error is that the backticks are not formatted correctly for the codeblock. The correct syntax is to indent the code by four spaces instead of using backticks. Here's how to fix it:
```py
package main
import fmt
def main():
 c = "cat"
 d = "dog"
 if c == d:
 print(f"{c} is exactly equal to {d}")
 else:
 print(f"{c} is not exactly equal to {d}")
 if c > d:
 print(f"{c} is lexically greater than {d}")
 elif c < d:
 print(f"{c} is lexically less than {d}")
 else:
 print(f"{c} is lexically equal to {d}")
 # Compare strings lexically in a case-insensitive manner
 eqf = """when interpreted as UTF-8 and compared under Unicode
simple case folding rules."""
 if c.casefold() == d.casefold():
 print(f"{c} is equal to {d} {eqf}")
 else:
 print(f"{c} is not equal to {d} {eqf}")
 # Seeing that the built-in operators work bytewise and the library
 # case folding functions interpret UTF-8, you might then ask about
 # other equality and inequality tests that interpret UTF-8.
 # Functions for this are not in the Go standard library but are in
 # the Go "sub repository" at golang.org/x/text.  There is support
 # for Unicode normalization, collation tables, and locale sensitive
 # comparisons.
```
