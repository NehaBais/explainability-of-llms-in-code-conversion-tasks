The error is that the `for` loop is not properly indented in Python. The correct indentation for a Python `for` loop is to have four spaces at the beginning of each line, instead of just two as in the Java code.
Here's the fix:
```py
import math
def factors(n):
 factors = set([n, 1])
 for i in range(int(math.sqrt(n))-1, 0, -1):
 if n % i == 0:
 factors.add(i)
 factors.add(n//i)
 return sorted(factors)
```
