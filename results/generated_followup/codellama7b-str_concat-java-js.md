The error message "SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'" indicates that the JavaScript parser expected a different token, which is not the case in the code provided. In this case, the `<script>` tag is unexpected because it is not a valid JavaScript syntax. To fix this issue, remove the `<script>` and `</script>` tags from the code as they are only used to embed JavaScript in an HTML file.

Here's the corrected code:
```js
var s = "hello"; console.log(s + " literal"); var s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```
