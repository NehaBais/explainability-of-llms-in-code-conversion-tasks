The error arises because `IOException` is an unreported exception; it was not caught or declared to be thrown, which is a common programming mistake in Java. The solution to this problem would be to either handle the exception (`try-catch`) or declare that the exception will be thrown by including it in the throws declaration of the method's signature.

Here's how to fix this in your Java code:

```java
private static void printFileSize(String filename) throws IOException {
    Path path = Paths.get(filename);
    long size;
    try {
        size = Files.size(path);
        System.out.println("Size of file " + filename + " is " + size + " bytes.");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException(e.getMessage() + ": " + path, e); // throw the original exception with an added message and its own traceback
    }
}
```
This fixed code will print the file size if it can be accurately determined; any errors while reading the file's size will be logged and caught in a way that retains the original error details.
