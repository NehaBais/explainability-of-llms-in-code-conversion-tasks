The error occurs because Go treats numbers as untyped constants by default, so they need to be explicitly converted to the desired type (in this case string) before being used as arguments to the `compare` function.

To fix the error, we can simply convert the integer literals to strings using string conversion functions or literal value assignment. Here is the corrected code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func compare(a, b string) {
	fmt.Printf("%q is of type %T and %q is of type %T\n",
		a, a, b, b)
	if a < b {
		fmt.Printf("%q is strictly less than %q\n", a, b)
	}
	if a <= b {
		fmt.Printf("%q is less than or equal to %q\n", a, b)
	}
	if a > b {
		fmt.Printf("%q is strictly greater than %q\n", a, b)
	}
	if a >= b {
		fmt.Printf("%q is greater than or equal to %q\n", a, b)
	}
	if a == b {
		fmt.Printf("%q is equal to %q\n", a, b)
	}
	if a != b {
		fmt.Printf("%q is not equal to %q\n", a, b)
	}
}

func compareInsensitive(a, b string) {
	fmt.Printf("%q is of type %T and %q is of type %T\n",
		a, a, b, b)
	if strings.ToLower(a) < strings.ToLower(b) {
		fmt.Printf("%q is strictly less than %q\n", a, b)
	}
}

func main() {
	compare("YUP", "YUP")
	compare("BALL", "BELL")
	compare("24", "123")

	// Go doesn't compare numbers as strings
	compare("5.0", "5") // This will not work, you need to convert them to float64

	compare(string(24), string(123)) // Fix: Convert int constants to strings explicitly.
}
```

The Go language is strongly typed and does not perform implicit type conversion, hence we have to manually convert the integer constants to strings.
