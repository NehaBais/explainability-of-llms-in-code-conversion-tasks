The error is caused by the fact that the `+` operator cannot be used to concatenate two character arrays in C. The `+` operator is only valid for pointers, not for character arrays. To fix this error, you can use the `strcat()` function to concatenate the two strings together. Here's the corrected code:
```c
char *string = "def";
char *new_string = (char *)malloc(strlen("abc") + strlen(string) + 1);
strcat(new_string, "abc");
strcat(new_string, string);
```
This code allocates a new character array to hold the concatenated string, and then uses `strcat()` twice to add the two strings together. The final result will be stored in the `new_string` variable.
