Error: `E0599` - No method named `get_type` found for reference `&str` in the current scope. This error occurs because `get_type()` is a method defined in the `std::any::Any` trait, but it is not available on all types. To fix this error, you can use the built-in `type` keyword to get the type of a variable instead of calling a method on it.
Fix: Replace `a.get_type()` and `b.get_type()` with `type(a)` and `type(b)`.
Rewritten code:
```rust
fn compare(a: &str, b: &str) {
    println!(
        "{} is of type {:?} and {} is of type {:?}",
        a,
        type(a),
        b,
        type(b)
    );
    if a < b {
        println!("{} is strictly less than {}", a, b);
    }
    if a <= b {
        println!("{} is less than or equal to {}", a, b);
    }
    if a > b {
        println!("{} is strictly greater than {}", a, b);
    }
    if a >= b {
        println!("{} is greater than or equal to {}", a, b);
    }
    if a == b {
        println!("{} is equal to {}", a, b);
    }
    if a != b {
        println!("{} is not equal to {}", a, b);
    }
    if a as *const str == b as *const str {
        println!("{} has object identity with {}", a, b);
    }
    if a as *const str != b as *const str {
        println!("{} has negated object identity with {}", a, b);
    }
}
fn main() {
    compare("YUP", "YUP");
    compare("BALL", "BELL");
    compare("24", "123");
    compare(24, 123);
    compare(5.0, 5);
}
```
