The error message indicates that there are undefined identifiers in the code. The specific errors are as follows:
- "error: use of undeclared identifier 'cout'" on lines 6, 9, and 12.
- "error: use of undeclared identifier 'cin' on line 7"
- "error: use of undeclared identifier 'endl' on lines 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13"
The fix for these errors is to include the `iostream` header file at the beginning of the C++ code. Here's the corrected code in a single fenced code block:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
  int a, b;
  cout << "Enter two integers: ";
  cin >> a >> b;
  cout << a << " + " << b << " = " << a + b << endl;
  cout << a << " - " << b << " = " << a - b << endl;
  cout << a << " * " << b << " = " << a * b << endl;
  cout << a << " / " << b << " = " << a / b << endl; // truncates towards 0
  cout << a << " %% " << b << " = " << (a % b)
       << endl; // same sign as first operand

  return 0;
}
```
Explanation of the error and fix:
- The error messages indicate that there are undefined identifiers in the code. Specifically, `cout`, `cin`, `endl`, and other variables are not declared. To resolve this, we need to include the necessary header files and declare these variables at the beginning of the C++ code.
- The `iostream` header file provides input/output stream objects (`cin` and `cout`) for reading and writing data.
- The `using namespace std;` statement makes all the names in the `std` namespace available without a prefix.
