The error is because we are not using any function from "unicode" package which leads to an unused import "unicode" error. 

In this specific code, there's no need of the unicode package as we don't have any unicode related operation like checking if a character is part of a certain range or counting characters in terms of Unicode code points rather than byte counts.

Therefore, to fix it all you need to do is removing the "unicode" import at line 3:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// rest of your code here
```
