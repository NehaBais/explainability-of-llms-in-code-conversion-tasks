The error can be explained as follows: extraneous ')' after condition, expected a statement

The fix is to remove the unnecessary parentheses around the `strcmp` function call inside the `if` statement. The corrected code block can be written as follows:
```c
#include 
#include 
int main() 
{
  char a[100] = "abc";
  char b[100] = "Bac";

  // comparing two strings for exact equality
  if (strcmp(a, b)) 
  {
    printf("The strings are equal\n");
  }

  // comparing two strings for inequality 
}
```
