The error is that the compiler cannot find the necessary header files, which are required for the functions used in the code. The fix is to add the appropriate include statements at the beginning of the file. Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include 
#include 
void mkdirp(const char *path) {
 size_t len;
 const char *p = strchr(path, '/');
 char dir[PATH_MAX];
 while (p != NULL) {
 len = p - path + 1;
 memcpy(dir, path, len);
 dir[len] = '\\0';
 mkdir(dir);
 path += len;
 p = strchr(path, '/');
 }
}
```
