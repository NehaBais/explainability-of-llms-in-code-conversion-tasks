The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the `std` namespace, which is part of the C++ Standard Library. This means that the code needs to include the necessary header files to access the library functions. The fix is to add `#include` at the top of the file to import the `std` namespace and its associated functions.
Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
int main() {
  std::string name = "Mary";
  std::string adj = "little";
  std::cout << name << " had a " << adj << " lamb" << std::endl;
  // You can specify order
  std::cout << adj << " had a " << name << " lamb" << std::endl;
  // Or named arguments if you prefer
  std::cout << "{name} had a {adj} lamb" << std::endl;
  std::cout.setf(std::ios::left);
  std::cout.width(10);
  std::cout << adj;
  std::cout << " had a ";
  std::cout.width(10);
  std::cout << name;
  std::cout << " lamb" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
