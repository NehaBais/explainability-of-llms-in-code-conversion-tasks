The error message indicates that the Java compiler is complaining about the use of an implicitly declared class, which is not enabled by default. This means that the `List` class must be imported from the `java.util` package in order to use it.
The fix for this error is to import the `List` class from the `java.util` package at the beginning of the file using the `import` statement.

This tells the compiler that we want to use the `List` class from the `java.util` package, which will resolve the import error.
The corrected code in a single fenced code block is:
```java
import java.util.*;
public static List getFactors(int num) {
 List factors = new ArrayList<>();
 for (int i = 1; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
 if (num % i == 0) {
 factors.add(i);
 if (i != num / i) {
 factors.add(num / i);
 }
 }
 }
 Collections.sort(factors);
 return factors;
}
```
This code defines a method `getFactors` that takes an integer `num` as input and returns a list of its factors. The code iterates over all possible divisors of the number up to its square root, checking if each divisor evenly divides it. If a divisor is found, it's added to the `factors` list along with its corresponding quotient (if applicable). Finally, the factors are sorted in ascending order and returned as a list.
