The error is caused by an unclosed delimiter at the end of the Rust code block. The fix involves correcting this issue by adding appropriate closing brackets or delimiters to complete the function definition. Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```rs
pub fn substring(s: &str, n: usize, m: usize) -> String {
    let end = if n + m > s.len() {
        s.len()
    } else {
        n + m
    };

    String::from_utf8_lossy(&s.bytes()[n..end].to_vec()))
}
```
