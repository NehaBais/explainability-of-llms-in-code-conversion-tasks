The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the necessary header files for `strdup` and `mkdir`, as well as the symbols `S_IRWXU`, `S_IRWXG`, `S_IROTH`, and `S_IXOTH`. To fix these issues, you need to include the appropriate header files and declare any missing symbols. Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include 
#include 
#include 
void mkdirp(const char *path) {
 char *copy = strdup(path);
 char *p = copy;
 int mode = S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH;
 for (; *p; p++) {
 if (*p == '/') {
 *p = 0;
 mkdir(copy, mode);
 *p = '/';
 }
 }
 free(copy);
}
```
The error messages indicate that the compiler was unable to find the necessary header files and symbols. To fix this, you need to include the appropriate header files and declare any missing symbols. In this case, you need to include `<string.h>` for `strdup` and `<stdlib.h>` for `free`, as well as declare the symbols `S_IRWXU`, `S_IRWXG`, `S_IROTH`, and `S_IXOTH`. The corrected code includes these header files and declares the necessary symbols to resolve the errors.
