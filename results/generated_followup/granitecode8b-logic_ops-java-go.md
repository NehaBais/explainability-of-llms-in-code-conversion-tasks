The error message indicates that the code is not being compiled as expected because the first line of the code does not begin with the keyword `package`, which is required for every Go program. 
This tells the Go compiler that the code is part of a package named "main". Once we've added this line, the code should compile without errors. Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func logic(a, b bool) {
 fmt.Println("a AND b:", a && b)
 fmt.Println("a OR b:", a || b)
 fmt.Println("NOT a:", !a)
}
```
In this corrected code, we've added the `import` statement to import the `fmt` package, which is used for formatted printing in Go. We've also renamed the function from `logic` to `main` to match the convention for the main entry point of a Go program. Finally, we've used the `&&`, `||`, and `!` operators for logical AND, OR, and NOT respectively, as well as `fmt.Println()` to print to the console.
