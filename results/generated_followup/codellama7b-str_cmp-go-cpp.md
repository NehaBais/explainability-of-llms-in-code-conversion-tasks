Error: The code contains undeclared identifiers `strings::EqualFold` which are not defined anywhere in the code. It seems that the code is using a library called `strings` but it's not imported or included properly.

Fix: To fix this issue, we need to add an `#include <string>` statement at the top of the file before using the `strings::EqualFold` function. This will import the necessary header files for the `strings` library and make the function available for use.
