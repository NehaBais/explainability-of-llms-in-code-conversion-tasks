Error:
- The `strlen()` function is not declared, so the compiler cannot find it.
- We are trying to declare an array with variable length, which is not allowed at file scope.
- The `sprintf()` function is a C library function that overwrites the contents of `s2`, so we need to pass it by reference.
Fix:
1. Declare `strlen()` as a library function using `extern` keyword in header file.
2. Use pointer arithmetic to calculate the length of the string literals.
3. Pass `s2` by reference to `sprintf()`.
```c
#include 
char s[] = "world!";
int main() {
 char *s2;
 unsigned long s2_len = strlen("Hello, ") + strlen(s);
 s2 = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char) * (s2_len + 1));
 sprintf(s2, "Hello, %s", s);
 printf("%s", s2);
 free(s2);
 return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
- Declare `strlen()` as a library function using the `extern` keyword in header file.
- Use pointer arithmetic to calculate the length of the string literals and store it in the variable `s2_len`.
- Allocate memory for `s2` using `malloc()`, and pass it by reference to `sprintf()`.
- Call `printf()` to print the contents of `s2`, and free the allocated memory using `free()`.
