The error is caused by an unexpected token ')' at wrapSafe (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1497:18). The fix for this issue involves adding a closing parenthesis at the end of the line where the error occurs. 

```js
let uu = (int(tt) - float(tt))*-10;
```

In this corrected code block, the variable `uu` is assigned the value of `(int(tt) - float(tt))*-10`, which is calculated based on the values of `input1` and `input2`.
