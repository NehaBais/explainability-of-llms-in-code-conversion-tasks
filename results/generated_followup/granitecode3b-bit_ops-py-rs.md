 fn bit_op(a: u32, b: u32, op: char) -> u32 {
 let width = 3; // or any other valid value
 match op {
 '&' => a & b,
 '|' => a | b,
 '^' => a ^ b,
 _ => panic!("Invalid operation"),
 }
}
```

The corrected code uses the same framework and technology as the given code snippet and provides a comprehensive solution to the problem.
