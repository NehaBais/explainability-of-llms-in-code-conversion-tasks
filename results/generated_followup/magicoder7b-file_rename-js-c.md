 The error is caused by the fact that C does not have implicit function declaration support, which means you need to manually declare functions before using them. Also, there are some specific system calls like `rename()` and `perror()` that require a definition of their argument types (which in case of rename() would be char*).

The fix is to include the appropriate header file for `rename()`, which is `<unistd.h>`, and also declare `perror()`. 

Here's the corrected C code:
```c
#include <stdio.h> // For printf
#include <stdlib.h> // For exit()
#include <unistd.h> // For rename()

int main() {
    if(rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0) {
        perror("Failed to rename input.txt");
        exit(1); // Exit with non-zero status for failure.
    }
    
    if(rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt") != 0) {
        perror("Failed to rename /input.txt");
        exit(1);
    }

    if(rename("docs", "mydocs") != 0) {
        perror("Failed to rename docs");
        exit(1);
    }
    
    if(rename("/docs", "/mydocs") != 0) {
        perror("Failed to rename /docs");
        exit(1);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
