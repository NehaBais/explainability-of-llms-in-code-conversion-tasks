Error: The `unsafe.Slice` function requires two arguments, but only one is being passed. This is causing the error message "not enough arguments for unsafe.Slice(str) (expected 2, found 1)".
Fix: To fix this error, we need to pass two arguments to the `unsafe.Slice` function, which are the slice and the length of the slice. We can do this by using the `len` function to get the length of the slice and passing it as an argument.

Corrected Code:
```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "unsafe"

func main() {
	str := []byte("my String")
	cstr := []byte("Changed ")
	dup := unsafe.Slice(str, len(str))
	sprintf(str, "%s%s", cstr, dup)
	free(dup)
	fmt.Println(string(str))
}
```
