The error is caused by the use of implicitly declared classes, which is a preview feature in Java 15. The fix is to enable implicitly declared classes by using the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling the code.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    String hello = "Hello world";
    System.out.println(hello + "!!!!");
}
```
