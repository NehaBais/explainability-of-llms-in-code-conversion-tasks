The error message indicates that the function `printLogic` does not return any value, which is causing the linker error. To fix this issue, you need to add a return statement at the end of the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
bool printLogic(bool a, bool b) {
  std::cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << "\n";
  std::cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << "\n";
  std::cout << "not a is " << (!a) << "\n";
  return true; // Return true to indicate successful execution
}
```

Now, the corrected code correctly returns a value and should compile without errors.
