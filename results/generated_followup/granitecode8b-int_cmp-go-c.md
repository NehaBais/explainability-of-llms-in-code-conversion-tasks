The error in the code is that it does not include the necessary header files for printf, scanf, and perror. The fix is to include the header files <stdio.h> and <stdlib.h> at the beginning of the program.
Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include 
#include 
int main() {
  int n1, n2;
  printf("Enter number: ");
  if (scanf("%d", &n1) != 1) {
    perror("Error reading input");
    return 1;
  }
  printf("Enter number: ");
  if (scanf("%d", &n2) != 1) {
    perror("Error reading input");
    return 1;
  }
  switch (n1 - n2) {
  case -1:
    printf("%d is less than %d", n1, n2);
    break;
  case 0:
    printf("%d is equal to %d", n1, n2);
    break;
  case 1:
    printf("%d is greater than %d", n1, n2);
    break;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code includes the necessary header files and uses explicit function declarations for printf, scanf, and perror. It also checks for errors when reading input from the user and exits with a non-zero status if an error occurs.
