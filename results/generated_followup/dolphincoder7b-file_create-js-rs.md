The error is related to the fact that the JavaScript version of Node.js does not have the `write_all` function available in `fs`. This function is specifically designed for writing large amounts of data in a single operation, which is why it is not present in Node.js. Instead, we can use a combination of `open`, `write`, and `close` to write to the file.

To fix this error, we should update our JavaScript code to make use of these new functions. The corrected Rust code will be as follows:
```rs
use std::fs;
use std::io::{Write};
fn main()  {
    let mut file = fs::File::create("./output.txt").expect("Failed to create file");
    file.write_all(&[]).expect("Failed to write data to file");

    let mut root_file = fs::File::create("/output.txt").expect("Failed to create file");
    root_file.write_all(&[]).expect("Failed to write data to file");

    fs::create_dir("docs").expect("Failed to create directory");
    fs::create_dir("/docs").expect("Failed to create directory");
}
```
This will ensure that the code works as expected by creating the specified files and directories.
