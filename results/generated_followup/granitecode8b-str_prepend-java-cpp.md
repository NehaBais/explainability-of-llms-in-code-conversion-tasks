The error is that the C++ compiler does not recognize `std` as a namespace or anything else, so it cannot find the definition of `string`. The fix is to include the `std` namespace at the beginning of the file or enclose the code in an appropriate scope. Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
int main() {
 std::string string = "def";
 string = "abc" + string;
 return 0;
}
```
This code includes the `std` namespace and defines a `main()` function to contain the code. The rest of the code is the same as the original Java code, which creates a string variable, assigns it a value, and then prepends another string literal to it.
