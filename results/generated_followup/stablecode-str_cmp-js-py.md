Error: `'(' was never closed`

Fix: Wrap the multiple lines of code into a Python function, ensuring proper indentation and parentheses matching. Here's an example of how to achieve this:

```python
def compare_strings():
    print(
        "abcd" == "abcd",  # True
        "ABCD".lower() == "abcd".lower(),  # True (the lower method in Python returns a string where all uppercase characters have been converted to lowercase))
```

This code block demonstrates the comparison of two strings using various operators provided by Python. The `compare_strings` function encapsulates this functionality, making it easy to reuse and test the comparisons.
