The error "`main` function not found in crate `yicoder9b_logic_ops_js_rs`" indicates that Rust is looking for an entry point to run, which is the `main` function. The `main` function is the starting point of any application written with Rust. Here's how you can fix it:

```rust
fn main() {
    logic(true, false);  // replace true and false with your actual values
}

fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
```
