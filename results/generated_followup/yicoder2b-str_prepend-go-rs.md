The error you are seeing is due to the fact that in Rust, string literals cannot be assigned to mutable variables directly like in Golang (you can't do `s = "world!"`). Instead, you need to create an immutable string literal with the text value you want to use, and assign it to a mutable variable.

The Rust code you posted should look like this:
```rs
let mut s = "world!"; 
s = format!("Hello, {}", s); // Prepend the string with the text "Hello, " and assign the result to 's'.
println!("{}", s); // Prints "Hello, world!"
```
Now, when you run this code, it will print "Hello, world!" as expected.
