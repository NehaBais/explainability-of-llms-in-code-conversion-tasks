The error occurs because Golang does not have direct equivalents to C++ I/O functions like `std::rename` or `os.Open`. The `os` package in Go provides functionality for renaming files, directories, and links. However, it lacks the ability to read/write file contents directly through streams.

To fix this issue, we can create a temporary file to perform the rename operation and then replace the original file with the renamed one. This way, we can maintain the integrity of the file contents while performing the renaming process.

Here's how you could do it:

```go
package main

import (
    "io/ioutil"
    "os"
    "path/filepath"
)

func rename(oldname string, newname string) error {
    tempFile, err := ioutil.TempFile("", "")
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer os.Remove(tempFile.Name()) // clean up

    _, err = tempFile.Write([]byte("temporary content"))
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    err = tempFile.Close()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    return os.Rename(tempFile.Name(), newname)
}
func main()  {
    // rename "input.txt" into "output.txt" in the current working directory
    err := rename("input.txt",  "output.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }

    // rename "docs" into "mydocs" in the current working directory
    err = os.Rename("docs",  "mydocs")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }

    // rename "/input.txt" into "/output.txt" in the filesystem root
    err = os.Rename("/input.txt",  "/output.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }

    // rename "/docs" into "/mydocs" in the filesystem root
    err = os.Rename("/docs",  "/mydocs")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }
}
```
In this solution, we first create a temporary file using `ioutil.TempFile` to serve as the destination for the rename operation. Then, we write some content into it and close it, ensuring that its contents are preserved during the renaming process. Finally, we perform the actual rename operation using `os.Rename`, replacing the original file with the renamed one.

By following this approach, we can achieve consistent and secure file renaming operations across different platforms in Golang.
