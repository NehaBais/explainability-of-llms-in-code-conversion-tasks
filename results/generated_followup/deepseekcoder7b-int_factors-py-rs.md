The error message indicates that Rust cannot find the `itertools` crate, which is required for this snippet of code. The fix for this would be to add `itertools = "0.9.0"` under `[dependencies]` in your `Cargo.toml` file.

The second error message indicates that the `factors2` variable cannot be borrowed as mutable, which suggests a logical issue with the way we are using iterators and vectors in Rust. 

Rather than trying to append factors1 with factors2 after it has been drained from its middle, we should have created a new vector that contains both halves of factors1 combined in reverse order. The fix for this would be to use the `concat` function provided by itertools instead of manually merging vectors like so:

```rs
extern crate itertools;
use itertools::Itertools;

fn factor(n: u32) -> Vec<u32> {
    let mut factors1 = (1..((n as f64).sqrt() as u32 + 1)).filter(|x| n % x == 0).collect_vec();
    factors1.append(&mut factors1.iter().map(|&x| n / x).collect_vec());
    factors1.sort_unstable(); 
    factors1 = factors1.into_iter().rev().chain(factors1.into_iter()).skip_while(|&x| x == 0).collect();
    factors1
}

fn main() {
    for i in [45, 53, 64] {
        println!("{}: factors: {:?}", i, factor(i));
    }
}
```
The `concat` function is used to merge two iterators into a new vector. The first half of the numbers are obtained using itertools::itertools::take_while with n divided by every number from 1 up until sqrt(n) as factors, and then the second half in reverse order is created using the remaining numbers.
