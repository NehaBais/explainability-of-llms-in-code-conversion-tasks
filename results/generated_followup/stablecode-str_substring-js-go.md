The error is caused by unexpected characters at the end of statements, specifically ']' at the end of lines 15, 20, 23, 26, 27, 30, and 31. 

To fix this error, we need to remove these unexpected characters. Here's a single-line explanation and code block with the correction:
```go
str = str[:len(str)-1]] 
```
This corrected code removes the unexpected ']' at the end of the statement.
