 The errors in this Rust code are due to type mismatches between int and unsigned int types. In C, bitwise operations can operate on different data types but when it comes to Rust, the operations must be performed on the same data type for which you define your function.
Also, the shifting and rotation operations in Rust are not as straightforward as in C. Bitwise left shift (<<) is supported for any integer type whereas bitwise right shift (>>) works differently on signed vs unsigned integers. The rotate operation is achieved through bitwise OR with a mask that represents the equivalent of a left rotate operation.
Here's how you could correct your code:

```rs
fn bitwise(a: i32, b: u8) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a & (1 << b));
    println!("a or b: {}", a | b as i32);
    println!("a xor b: {}", a ^ b as i32);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);
    // Since the C language allows variable shifts, Rust can't enforce constant shift amounts.
    // As such, we'll just multiply `b` by the size of an integer in bytes to convert it into bit shifts.
    let byte_shift = std::mem::size_of::<i32>() * 8;
    println!("a << n: {}", a << (b as i32 * byte_shift)); // left shift
    println!("a >> n: {}", a >> (b as i32 * byte_shift)); // right shift, no rotate equivalent in C
}
```
In this corrected code, we are taking an unsigned 8-bit integer `b` for rotations and shifts because Rust doesn't support bitwise operations on signed integers. The `& (1 << b)` operation is used to perform a left rotate because Rust lacks specific operators like C++ for it. Please note that the number of bits to shift `b` times has to be multiplied by 8 because we are shifting by bytes.
This code will now compile and run as expected, but keep in mind that it's not equivalent to your original C function which was performing bitwise operations on signed integers with variable shift amounts.
