The error occurs because "path/filepath" is imported but not used anywhere in the program. The file path package is useful for converting relative paths to absolute ones, which isn't needed here. To fix this issue, we can remove the import statement and change all references of "path/filepath". This will eliminate the error.

Here is the corrected code:
```go
package main

import  (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	filename1 := "input.txt" // file in current directory
	size, err := getFileSize(filename1)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error getting size of %s: %v\n", filename1, err)
	} else {
		fmt<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>ize of input.txt is {size} bytes
``` 
And the function getFileSize remains the same. The rest of the program stays the same as well for this conversion.
