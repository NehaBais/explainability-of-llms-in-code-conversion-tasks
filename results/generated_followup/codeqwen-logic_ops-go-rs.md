Error: `A` is not found in this scope, `main` function missing.

Fix: In Rust, you cannot use `A` directly since it's not defined anywhere. We need to pass it as a parameter to the function. The missing `main` function was also added for executing our code.

Corrected Code:
```rs
fn print_logic(A: bool, B: bool) {
    println!("A and B is {}", A && B);
    println!("A or B is {}", A || B);
    println!("not A is {}", !A);
}

fn main() {
   print_logic(true, false);
}
```
