The error is caused by the fact that `os.Getwd()` returns two values: the current working directory as a string, and an error value indicating whether the operation was successful or not. However, in the original JavaScript code, only the first return value is being used, which causes the compiler to report the "multiple-value" error.

To fix the issue, you need to modify the Go code to handle both return values. You can do this by using a tuple assignment statement, like this:
```go
wd, err := os.Getwd()
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println("Error getting current working directory:", err)
} else {
	// Use the first value (wd) as the current working directory
	inputFile = filepath.Join(wd, "input.txt")
	docsFolder = filepath.Join(wd, "docs")
}
```
This code uses a tuple assignment statement to assign both values returned by `os.Getwd()` to separate variables (`wd` and `err`). If there is no error, the first variable (wd) is used as the current working directory in the filepath construction.
