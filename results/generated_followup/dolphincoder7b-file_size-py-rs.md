The error message is indicating that `let` is not allowed in Rust outside of a function or module scope. A solution to this issue involves using the `const` or `static` keyword instead, which allow for global variables. Here's how you can rewrite the code to fix it:


```rust
use std::fs;

const CURRENT_SIZE: u64 = fs::metadata("input.txt").unwrap().len();
const ROOT_SIZE: u64 = fs::metadata("/input.txt").unwrap().len();
```

The updated code uses `const` to define the global variables `CURRENT_SIZE` and `ROOT_SIZE`, which will then be accessed throughout your program. This ensures that you can still access these values even after the execution of this snippet.
