The error message indicates that there are issues with including the necessary headers for outputting text to files and creating directories, as well as with identifying the types of certain variables used in the code. The fix involves including the appropriate header files and declaring the types correctly. Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
  try {
    ofstream file("output.txt");
    file.close();
    ofstream root_file("/output.txt");
    root_file.close();
    mkdir("docs");
    mkdir("/docs");
  } catch (exception &e) {
    cout << e.what() << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Note that the `using namespace std;` statement is not necessary in this case, as it is not needed for using standard library types and functions. Also, it's important to check for any errors or exceptions that may occur when opening or creating files or directories. The corrected code includes error handling using a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may be thrown.
