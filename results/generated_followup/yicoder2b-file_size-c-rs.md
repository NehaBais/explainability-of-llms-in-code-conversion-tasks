Sure, it seems like there are multiple errors in your Rust program. They can be explained as follows:

1. E0023: This error arises from a mismatch between the number of fields in a pattern and the number of fields in a tuple. The pattern `Err(io::Error _e)` has 2 fields, but the tuple variant `Err` (from result module) only contains one field.

2. E0432: This error arises from an unresolved symbol or import. It may be due to not finding the function `process_args` in your scope.

3. E0599: This error arises from a method name mismatch between methods of the same type and across different types. The method `read_line` was not found for struct `File` in the related contexts.

4. E0536: This error comes from an overload conflict, where multiple functions have the same name but have different argument types.

This is a common issue due to incorrect usage of Rust features or libraries. Here's how you can potentially fix these issues:

1. Replace `Err(io::Error _e)` with just `Err` in your pattern matching expression and ensure that the `Err` variant of `Result` has 1 field.

2. Make sure that `process_args` is properly imported (if it's not, you might need to add a statement like `extern crate std::process;`).

3. Ensure that there are no overloads with the same name but different argument types in your code as Rust does not allow this.

Remember, if you get any other error, be sure to check your code for typos or errors that may have been caused by a previous error. Also, ensure that all necessary dependencies of your project (like `std::process` and `fs::File`) are properly imported and included in the Rust's standard library collection.
