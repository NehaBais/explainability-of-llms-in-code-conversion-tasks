The error occurred because the `<filesystem>` library is not recognized, which may be due to missing headers or compiler version issues.

To fix the issue, ensure that you are using a C++17 or later standard and include the correct header file for filesystem operations.

Here is the corrected code in a single code block:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::filesystem::path current_path = std::filesystem::current_path();

  try {
    if (std::filesystem::exists(current_path / "file.txt")) {
      std::cout << "File exists: file.txt" << std::endl;
    } else {
      std::cout << "File does not exist: file.txt" << std::endl;
    }
  } catch (const std::exception& e) {
    std::cerr << "Error accessing file system: " << e.what() << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
