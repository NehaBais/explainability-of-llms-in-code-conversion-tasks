The error message is indicating that it cannot find 'boost/filesystem.hpp' file, which means Boost is not installed or its path is not included in the project.

To fix this issue, you need to properly install and include the necessary libraries for your code to compile successfully:
- Install Boost: If Boost is not installed on your system yet, download it from boost's official website (https://www.boost.org/users/download/) and follow the instructions in their 'Getting Started' section.
  
- Include the path of Boost headers in your project settings or while compiling the code. This can be done with the `-I` flag followed by the directory containing the header files (`-I /usr/local/include`), where you have installed Boost on Linux system for example. 

- Link the necessary libraries during compilation process using the `-l` flag: In this case 'boost_system' and 'boost_filesystem' libraries should be linked when building your project.

Here is a corrected version of C++ code with explanation:

```cpp
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp> // Include boost filesystem header file
#include <iostream>             // Include iostream for input-output stream operations

int main() {
  namespace fs = boost::filesystem;  // Create a namespace alias for simplicity

  fs::path dir_path("./path/to/dir"); // Define the directory path to be created
  try { 
    if (!fs::create_directories(dir_path)) { // Try creating directories, handle any exceptions
      std::cerr << "Failed to create directories: " << dir_path << std::endl;
    }
  } catch (const fs::filesystem_error &e) { 
    // Catch and handle any filesystem related errors
    std::cerr << "Filesystem Exception thrown: " << e.what() << std::endl; // Print error message
  }
  return 0;
}
```
