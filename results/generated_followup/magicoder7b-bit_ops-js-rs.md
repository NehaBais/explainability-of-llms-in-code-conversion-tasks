 The error is occurring because Rust does not implicitly convert `u8` to `i32` while performing bitwise operations and hence requires explicit type casting (either by using a function like `as` or a method like `to_i32()`).

Corrected Code: 
```rs
fn bitwise(a: i32, b: u8) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a & b as i32);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a | b as i32);
    println!("a XOR b: {}", a ^ b as i32);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a); 
    println!("a << b: {}", a << b); // left shift
    println!("a >> b: {}", a >> b); // arithmetic right shift
    println!("a >>> b: {}", (a as u32) >> b as u32); // logical right shift, since Rust's >> operator is an arithmetic shift. Note that we first cast 'a' to 'u32' so that we can perform a 32-bit shift
}
```
In the corrected code, `b` is explicitly converted to `i32` using `as i32` before performing bitwise AND and OR operations. The NOT operation on `i32` type directly gives us ~a. For left rotate and right rotate operations, we need to cast 'a' to a larger data type (either `u32` or `usize`) because Rust does not provide built-in rotate operators for smaller integers (`u8`, `i8`).

In the last line of corrected code, `(a as u32) >> b` is used because `>>` operator performs an arithmetic right shift operation on its first operand. The result is then cast to a `u32`.
