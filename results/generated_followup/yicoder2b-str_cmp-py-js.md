The error message suggests that there is an issue with the syntax of the code enclosed in backticks. The 'SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token' means that this piece of code has a problem in its structure which JavaScript can't understand. This might be caused due to different versions of Node.js or packages used by the developer, so it is hard to diagnose without seeing the specific problematic line of code.

Here are the possible corrections based on the error message:

1) The error might be caused by using non-standard or unsupported characters in the string literals.
Solution: Replace all invalid characters with valid ones.

2) If it's about different versions of Node.js, try to update it. If the error still persists after updating, then maybe there is some change in the JavaScript engine which can solve this problem. 

3) There could be a difference in types between Python and JavaScript.
Solution: Change the types in JavaScript to match those in Python. For example, Python considers '24' and 123 as different numbers while JavaScript treats them as one number.

The equivalent code in JavaScript would be:
```javascript
function compare(a, b) {
    console.log("%r is of type %s and %r is of type %s", a, typeof a, b, typeof b);
    if (a < b) {
        console.log('%r is strictly less than %r', a, b);
    } else if (a <= b) { 
        console.log('%r is less than or equal to %r', a, b);
    } else {
        console.log("No strict comparison for %r and %r", a, b);
    }
    if (a > b) {
        console.log('%r is strictly greater than %r', a, b);
    } else if (a >= b) { 
        console.log('%r is greater than or equal to %r', a, b);
    } else {
        console.log("No strict comparison for %r and %r", a, b);
    }
    if (a == b) {
        console.log('%r is equal to %r', a, b);
    } else {
        console.log('%r is not equal to %r', a, b);
    }
    if (a != b) {
        console.log('%r is not equal to %r', a, b);
    } else {
        console.log("Both %r and %r are equal", a, b);
    }
    if (a === b) {
        console.log('%r has object identity with %r', a, b);
    } else if (a !== b) {
        console.log('%r does not have object identity with %r', a, b);
    } else {
        console.log("No object identity comparison for %r and %r", a, b);
    }
}
compare('YUP', 'YUP');
```
This JavaScript code should run without errors if the types in Python match those in JavaScript.
