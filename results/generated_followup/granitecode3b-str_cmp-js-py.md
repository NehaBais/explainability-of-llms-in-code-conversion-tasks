The error message indicates that there is an issue with the syntax of the Python code enclosed in backticks. Specifically, it seems that the code contains a syntax error when trying to use the `===` operator for string comparison. 
The correct syntax for the `===` operator is to use triple equals (`===`) instead of double equals (`==`). The `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, which is what we need for a strong comparison between two strings. 
To fix the error, simply replace the double equals sign with triple equals signs:
```py
print("abcd" === "abcd") # True
```
The corrected code block should now work as expected. Let me know if you have any other questions!
