The error message indicates that there are some syntax issues with the `return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>` statement, which is not expected in C++. Additionally, 'begin▁of▁sentence｜' is also an unexpected identifier.

The fix for this would be to simply return 0 at the end of main function as it signifies successful execution of the program: `return 0;`

Here is the corrected code snippet:
```cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if (argc < 3) {
        std::exit(1);
    }

    int a = atoi(argv[1]);
    int b = atoi(argv[2]);

    // error check, exit if second conversion resulted in 0
    if (!b) {
        std::exit(2);
    }

    std::cout << "a+b  = " << a + b << '\n';
    std::cout << "a-b  = " << a - b << '\n';
    std::cout << "a*b  = " << a * b << '\n';

    if (b != 0) {                               // prevent division by zero
        std::cout << "a/b  = " << a / b << '\n';  /* truncates towards 0 */
        int remainder = a % b;
        std::cout << "a%b  = " << remainder << '\n';
    }
    
    return 0; // corrected the issue with this line.
}
```
