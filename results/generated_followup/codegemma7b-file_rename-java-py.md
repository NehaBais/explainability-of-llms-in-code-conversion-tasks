**Error:** The error occurs because the f-string formatting expects a valid expression after the opening curly brace. In this case, the expression `rename_file(oldname, newname) ? ' was renamed as ' : ' could not be renamed into '` is invalid.

**Fix:** Replace the conditional expression with a simple string concatenation.

**Corrected Code:**

```python
print(f"The following {type} called {oldname}"
      f"{' was renamed as ' if rename_file(oldname, newname) else ' could not be renamed into '}{newname}.")
```
