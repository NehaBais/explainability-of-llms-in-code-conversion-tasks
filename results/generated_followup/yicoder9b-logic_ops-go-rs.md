The error means that there is no `main` function in Rust, which is required for running the program. To fix this issue, wrap your functions inside a `main` function:

```rs
fn main() {
    print_logic(true, false); // replace with whatever you want to test
}

fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
```
