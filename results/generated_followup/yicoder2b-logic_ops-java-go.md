The error you are encountering is due to Go's use of syntax that doesn't quite match Java, specifically the lack of import statements and package declaration at the top level. In Go, these declarations must be moved to a file named main.go in a specific directory. When running this code with go run, it will fail because there is no such main.go file present at that location.

The equivalent Golang code from the Java code provided would look like:
```go
package main
import "fmt"

func logic(a, b bool) {
    fmt.Printf("a AND b: %v\n", a && b)
    fmt.Printf("a OR b: %v\n", a || b)
    fmt.Printf("NOT a: %v\n", !a)
}

func main(){
    logic(true, true)  // You can call this with different boolean values to see the results
}
```
This will print the logical operations "AND" and "OR" for the provided inputs as well as the NOT of first argument. When you compile and run it using `go run` or `go run filename.go` command, it should work fine.
