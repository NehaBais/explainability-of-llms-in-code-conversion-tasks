The error occurs because the linker cannot find the `main` symbol, which is needed to start execution of the C program. In C language, `main` function serves as the entry point for a program, where it begins its execution.

To fix this, you need to ensure your program has a `main` function.

And here is the complete code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void logic(int a, int b) {
  printf("a AND b: %d\n", (a && b));
  printf("a OR b : %d\n", (a || b));
  printf("NOT a : %d\n", !a);
}

int main() {
  logic(true, false); // Test case
  return 0;
}
```

This code defines the `logic` function that takes two integers as arguments. It then calls this function inside the `main` function with some test values. The `main` function is needed because it's where execution of a C program starts from.
