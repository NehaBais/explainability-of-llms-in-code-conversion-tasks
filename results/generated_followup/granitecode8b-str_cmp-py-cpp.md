The error is that the compiler cannot find the `string` class because it is not included in the code. To fix this, add `#include` before the line where the `string` class is used. The corrected code is as follows:
```cpp
#include
#include
using namespace std;
int main() {
 string a = "YUP";
 string b = "BALL";
 if (a == b) {
 cout << a << " is equal to " << b << endl;
 } else {
 cout << a << " is not equal to " << b << endl;
 }

 if (a != b) {
 cout << a << " is not equal to " << b << endl;
 } else {
 cout << a << " is equal to " << b << endl;
 }

 if (a < b) {
 cout << a << " is lexically less than " << b << endl;
 } else {
 cout << a << " is not lexically less than " << b << endl;
 }

 if (a > b) {
 cout << a << " is lexically greater than " << b << endl;
 } else {
 cout << a << " is not lexically greater than " << b << endl;
 }

 string c = "yup";
 string d = "YUP";
 if (c == d) {
 cout << c << " is equal to " << d << " (case sensitive)" << endl;
 } else {
 cout << c << " is not equal to " << d << " (case sensitive)" << endl;
 }

 string e = "123";
 int f = 123;
 if (e == to_string(f)) {
 cout << e << " is equal to " << f << " (numeric conversion)" << endl;
 } else {
 cout << e << " is not equal to " << f << " (numeric conversion)" << endl;
 }

 return 0;
}
```
