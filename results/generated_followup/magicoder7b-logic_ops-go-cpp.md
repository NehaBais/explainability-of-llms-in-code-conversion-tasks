The error occurs because the linker cannot find the `main` function, which is usually the entry point of any program. In C++, we don't have an `auto-generated main()` function like Golang does. Hence, when you try to compile and run this code without a valid `main` function in your project, it will fail with the error message provided above. 

To fix this issue, you need to create a new C++ file (let's call it logic.cpp), put the function `printLogic` into that file, then compile both files together using the g++ compiler. Here is how your code should look like:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printLogic(bool a, bool b) {
    std::cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << "\n";
    std::cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << "\n";
    std::cout << "not a is " << (!a) << "\n";
}
```
