Error: The code contains an unmatched parenthesis, which results in a syntax error.

Fix: To fix this issue, remove the closing parenthesis ")" at the end of the line where the input function is used to get the first integer from the user.

Corrected code:
```py
# Get two integers from the user
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: ")))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: ")))


# Display a message based on the condition between the two integers
if a < b:
    print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
elif a == b:
    print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```
