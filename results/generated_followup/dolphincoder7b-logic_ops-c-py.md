The error occurred because the `!` operator is used to negate the value of `a`, but it's outside the f-string which requires a valid expression before `!`. To fix this, we can enclose the negation operation inside the f-string.

The entire corrected code would look like this:

```py
def print_logic(a, b):
    print(f"a and b is {a and b}")
    print(f"a or b is {a or b}")
    print(f"not a is {not a}")
```

This issue has been resolved by enclosing the `!` operator inside the f-string. This ensures that it's evaluated as part of the formatting expression, allowing Python to handle boolean values correctly.
