The error message indicates that the `mkdir` function is not being recognized within the code. This is because the fs module is not available to C. The correct way to create a directory in C is by using the `mkdir()` system call, which is a function in the `<unistd.h>` header file. In the corrected code, we have included this header file and called the `mkdir` system call for both cases: creating the directory "here" (in the current working directory) and in the filesystem root.

Here is the fixed C code:
```c
#include  <fcntl.h>
#include  <stdio.h>
#include  <stdlib.h>
#include  <unistd.h>

void fct(int err) {
  if (err != 0)
    perror("An error occurred");
}

int main() {
  int out  = open("./output.txt", O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
  close(out);

  int out2  = open("/output.txt", O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
  close(out2);

  int docs  = mkdir("./docs", 0755);
  if (docs == -1)
    fct(-1);

  int docs2  = mkdir("/docs", 0755);
  if (docs2 == -1)
    fct(-1);

  return 0;
}
```
