The error is caused by an invalid character `ï½œ` (U+FF5C) being used. This character is not part of Python's syntax for bitwise operations. The correct operator to use in this context would be the pipe symbol `|`, representing a logical OR operation. 

The fix involves replacing the incorrect character with the correct one:
```py
print('shr: {0:016b}'.format((a >> b) & 0xffff))
```
