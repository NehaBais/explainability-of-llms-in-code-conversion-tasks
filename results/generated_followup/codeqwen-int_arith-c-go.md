The error occurs because Go doesn't allow for global variables to be accessed without initialization, unlike C. The first three lines of the provided Go code define `A` and `b`, but they are not initialized with any values before being used in the calculations or output statements.

Fixing this issue, you need to initialize `A` and `b` by assigning them integer values. For example, you can set them equal to 0:

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "strconv"
import "os"

func main() {
	if len(os.Args) != 3 {
		fmt.Println("Usage: program [A] [b]")
		return
	}

	A, err1 := strconv.Atoi(os.Args[1])
	b, err2 := strconv.Atoi(os.Args[2])

	if err1 != nil || err2 != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error: Invalid input")
		return
	}

	sum := A + b
	difference := A - b
	product := A * b
	quotient := A / b  // Go's integer division truncates towards 0 (in C99)
	remainder := A % b // same sign as first operand (in C99)

	fmt.Printf("A+b = %d\n", sum)
	fmt.Printf("A-b = %d\n", difference)
	fmt.Printf("A*b = %d\n", product)
	fmt.Printf("A/b = %d\n", quotient)
	fmt.Printf("A%%b = %d\n", remainder)
}
```

This code now works as expected and will print the results of the arithmetic operations on `A` and `b`.
