The error message is "use of undeclared identifier 'compare':"  This means that the compiler couldn't find the definition for the `compare` function, which we need to pass as a callback to `qsort`. We can fix this by including the header file `stdlib.h` at the beginning of the C code and defining the `compare` function before using it in the `qsort` call. Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include  <math.h>
#include  <stdio.h>
#include  <stdlib.h>

// Callback function for sorting (compares two integers)
int compare(const void  *a, const void  *b) {
  int A  =  *(int  *)a;
  int B  =  *(int  *)b;
  if  (A  < B)
    return -1;
  else if  (A  > B)
    return 1;
  return 0;
}

// Function to find factors of a number
int  *factors(int num, int  *returnSize) {
   // Find the number of factors
   *returnSize  = 0;
   for  (int i  = 1; i  <= sqrt(num); i++)
     if  (num  % i  == 0)
       (*returnSize)++;

   // Initialize array to store factors
   int  *factorArr  = malloc((*returnSize)  * sizeof(int));
   int index  = 0;

   // Loop through factors and add to array
   for  (int i  = 1; i  <= sqrt(num); i++)
     if  (num  % i  == 0)  {
       factorArr[index++]  = i;

       // Add reciprocal of current factor only if it's not the same as current
       // factor
       if  ((num  / i  != i))
         factorArr[index++]  = num  / i;
     }

   // Sort array in ascending order
   qsort(factorArr, *returnSize, sizeof(int), compare);

   return factorArr;
}
```
The error was due to the fact that `compare` is defined in a different scope than where it is being used. To resolve this issue, we need to define the function before using it. This is done by adding the necessary `#include <stdlib.h>` statement at the top of the file and defining the `compare` function within the `main` block or any other suitable scope.
