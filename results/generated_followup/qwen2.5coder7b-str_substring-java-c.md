The error is due to the missing `unicode/ustream.h` header file, which is part of the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library.

To fix this issue, ensure that the ICU library is installed on your system and that its include path is correctly specified during compilation.

Corrected code:
```c
#include <unicode/ustream.h>

int main() {
    // Your code here
    return 0;
}
```
(Note: The provided code block was empty, so I've added a simple `main` function as an example. Replace this with your actual code.)
