The error message indicates that there is already a variable named `c` declared in the method `main(String[])`. To fix this error, you need to change the name of the variable `c` to something else, such as `c1`. Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.Comparator;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String c = "cat";
    String d = "dog";

    // Comparing two strings for exact equality
    if (c.equals(d)) {
      System.out.println(c + " is bytewise identical to " + d);
    }

    // Comparing two strings for inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality)
    if (!c.equals(d)) {
      System.out.println(c + " is bytewise different from " + d);
    }

    // Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other
    if (c.compareTo(d) < 0) {
      System.out.println(c + " is lexically bytewise less than " + d);
    }

    // Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after than the other
    if (c.compareTo(d) > 0) {
      System.out.println(c + " is lexically bytewise greater than " + d);
    }

    // Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before or equal to the other
    if (c.compareTo(d) <= 0) {
      System.out.println(c + " is lexically bytewise less than or equal to " + d);
    }

    // Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after or equal to the other
    if (c.compareTo(d) >= 0) {
      System.out.println(c + " is lexically bytewise greater than or equal to " + d);
    }

    // A case insensitive compare can be done using the Comparator class in Java
    Comparator c1 = Comparator.naturalOrder();
    if (c1.compare("cat", "dog") == 0) {
      System.out.println("cat is equal to dog");
    } else {
      System.out.println("cat is not equal to dog");
    }
  }
}
```
