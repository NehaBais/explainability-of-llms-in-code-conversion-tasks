The error message indicates that there are several issues with the Rust code:

* The `join` function is not found in this scope, which means it is not imported or defined in the current module.
* The formatting specifier is missing, which means that the `print!` macro is not called correctly.
* The argument passed to the `join` function is of the wrong type, expected `String`, found `&str`. This can be fixed by calling the `.to_string()` method on the argument.

The corrected code should look like this:
```rs
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello"); // Create a string variable equal to any text value.
    println!("{}", s1 + " world"); // Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal.
    print!(", ".join(s1.to_string(), "world", "mom").to_string());
}
```
