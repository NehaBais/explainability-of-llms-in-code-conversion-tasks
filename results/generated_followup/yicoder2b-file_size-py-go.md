The error you are seeing is due to Golang not being able to interpret the Python code you provided, as `os.Open` was not recognized by Golang, and `FileInfo()` function of a file object in Go does not exist either.

For the given Python code that prints out the size of 'input.txt' and '/' (root directory), if you try to run it in Golang, you will see a syntax error because there is no equivalent method or functionality for `FileInfo()` in Golang. 

Here is the equivalent Go code:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	file, err := os.Open("input.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	size1 := file.FileInfo() // This does not exist in Go

	file, err = os.Open("/")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// size2 := file.FileInfo() // Again this does not exist in Go
	size2 := file.FileInfo().Size()  // But you can use FileInfo method to get the actual size of '/'

	fmt.Printf("The size of 'input.txt' is %d bytes\n", size1) // This will not compile in Go because `file.FileInfo()` has no such property
	fmt.Printf("The size of '/' (root directory in your system) is %d bytes\n", size2)
}
``` 

You should have the correct method and function calls according to the language you are using.
