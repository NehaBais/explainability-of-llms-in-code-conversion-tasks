The error is due to the fact that the "strings" package is imported but not used in the code. Go requires that all packages used in the code are explicitly stated and used, otherwise it will result in an error. The fix is to remove the import statement for the "strings" package since it is not used in the code.

Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	s := "hello"
	fmt.Println(s + " literal") // s2 is initialized
}
```
