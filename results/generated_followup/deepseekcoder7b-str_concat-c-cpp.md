The error message indicates that there are some syntax issues with the expression `<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜> concat(s, " literal");`. In C++, there is no such built-in function as `concat()` to concatenate two strings. Instead, we can use `+` operator directly between string objects. 

Therefore, the corrected code block in C++ will look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string s = "hello";
    
    // Illustrate the operation – show content of variables
    std::cout << s << " literal" << std::endl;
  
    // concatenation with another string literal
    std::string s2 = s + " literal";
    std::cout << s2 << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
