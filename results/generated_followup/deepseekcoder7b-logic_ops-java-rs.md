The error occurs because Rust requires an entry point to execute programs, often denoted as `main` function. However, in this case since we just want to define utility functions that can be used elsewhere without running them, there's no need for a main function and it is causing the build to fail. 

The fix would be to remove the main function declaration:
```rs
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
``` 
Then you can use this function in other parts of your Rust program. But remember that if it is not being used, there's no need to add the main function as mentioned earlier. The error E0601 generally occurs when the compiler doesn't find an entry point for the application (the 'main' function). 

In this case though, since we are defining a utility/helper method that can be used in other places and not intended to run as an independent executable, it is ok to leave out the main function. It only becomes necessary when you want your program to do something specific like read from stdin or write to stdout.
