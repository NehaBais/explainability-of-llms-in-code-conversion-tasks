The error message indicates that there is an unused import (`std::path::Path`) and no `main` function has been declared. To fix these issues, we can remove the unused import statement since it's not needed for this particular task. Also, in Rust, by convention a binary crate should have a main function to be able to run the executable, so you may include one if necessary.

Here is the corrected code:

```rs
use std::fs;

fn mkdirp(path: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    fs::create_dir_all(path)?;
    Ok(())
}

// Consider adding a `main` function for testing
fn main() {
    let _ = mkdirp("/tmp/test");
}
```
In this code, `?` is used to propagate errors upward. If the function encounters an error (like a file not found) it will return that error immediately upwards in the stack. The calling function can handle these potential errors and can do so using pattern matching on the returned value. This adheres to Rust's convention of handling errors with `Result` types rather than callbacks.
