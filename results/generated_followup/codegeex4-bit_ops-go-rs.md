The error occurs because Rust does not allow bitwise operations between different numerical types directly, which is what's happening here by trying to perform a bit-wise OR operation on an i16 and u16 type.

To fix this, we can cast both operands to the same type (u16 in this case) before performing the bit-wise OR operation. Here's the corrected code:

```rust
let ror = (((a >> ub) | (a.wrapping_neg() & ((1u32 << ub) - 1) as i16).wrapping_neg()) 
    << (16 - ub)) as u16 
| ((ua << (16 - ub)) | (ua >> ub)) as u16;
```

I have casted the entire result of the ror operation to a u16 type. This will ensure that the bitwise OR operation between the two results is valid because they are both u16 types. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
