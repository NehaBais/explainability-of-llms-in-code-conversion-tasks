The error occurs because the `let` keyword is used to declare a new variable, but it is not allowed within the `String::from()` function call. The fix is to move the `let` declaration outside of the function call.

```rs
let mut s1 = String::from("Hello");
s1.push_str(", World!");
println!("{}", s1);
```
