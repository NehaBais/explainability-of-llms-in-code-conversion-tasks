The error occurs because the `compare()` method requires three arguments: the position of the first string, the length of the first string, and the second string. The code is missing the position and length arguments. The fix is to provide these arguments in the `compare()` method call.

```cpp
if (c.compare(0, c.size(), d, 0, d.size()) == 0) {
    std::cout << c << " is case insensitive equal to " << d << std::endl;
}
```
