The error occurs because the `std::filesystem` namespace is not recognized because it was not included correctly or the compiler does not support C++17.

To fix the issue, ensure that you are using a compiler that supports C++17 and include the `<filesystem>` header properly.

Here is the corrected code in a single code block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <filesystem>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

int main() {
  // Check for files and directories in the current working directory
  if (fs::exists(fs::path("docs/input.txt"))) {
    std::cout << "File 'docs/input.txt' exists in the current working directory." << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "File 'docs/input.txt' does not exist in the current working directory." << std::endl;
  }

  if (fs::exists(fs::path("/docs/input.txt"))) {
    std::cout << "File '/docs/input.txt' exists in the filesystem root." << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "File '/docs/input.txt' does not exist in the filesystem root." << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This code will check if a file named `input.txt` and a directory named `docs` exist in both the current working directory and at the root of the filesystem.
