The error occurred because there is no `main` function to run the C++ program, which is required by every C++ program. A minimal working executable needs a definition for a main function that tells the compiler where to start executing the program. 

To fix this issue, you would typically create a simple 'driver' function.

The entire corrected code with all the functions together will be:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void logic(bool a, bool b) {
    cout << "a AND b: " << (a && b) << endl;
    cout << "a OR b: " << (a || b) << endl;
    cout << "NOT a: " << !a << endl;
}

int main() {
    bool a = true;
    bool b = false;
    logic(a, b);
    return 0;
}
```
