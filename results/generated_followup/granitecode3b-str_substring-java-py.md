The error is that the `substring` function is indented after the opening parenthesis of the `if` statement, which is causing an indentation error. The fix is to remove the extra indentation on the following line.
The corrected code is as follows:
```py
def substring(string, n, m=None):
 if m is not None:
 return string[n:n+m]
 elif n == 0:
 return string[:-1]
 else:
 return string[string.index(n):string.index(n)+m+1]
 
def substring_with_char(string, char, m=None):
 if m is not None:
 return string[string.find(char):string.find(char)+m+1]
 else:
 return string[:string.rfind(char)]
```
The corrected code uses logical characters, not 8-bit code units for UTF-8 or 16-bit code units for UTF-16, and references Unicode code points (rather than 8-bit code units). This means that it can handle all valid Unicode characters, regardless of whether they are in the Basic Multilingual Plane or above it.
