The error message indicates that the symbol `main`, which is the entry point of any C++ program, could not be found when it was being linked.

To fix this issue, you need to define a main function in your program.

Here's how to correct code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a = 5, b = 2; // replace these with the actual numbers you want to use
  bitwise(a, b);
  return 0;
}

void bitwise(int a, int b) {
  cout << "a AND b: " << (a & b) << endl;
  cout << "a OR b: " << (a | b) << endl;
  cout << "a XOR b: " << (a ^ b) << endl;
  cout << "NOT a: " << ~a << endl;
  cout << "a << b: " << (a << b) << endl; // left shift
  // Arithmetic right shift in C++ is performed with >> operator.
  cout << "a >> b: " << (a >> b) << endl;
  // There's no direct support for logical right shift in C++,
  // but you can get the same result using arithmetic shift on unsigned numbers.
  cout << "a >>> b: " << ((unsigned)a >> b) << endl;

#if __cplusplus >= 201703L
  cout << "a rol b: " << rotl(a, b) << endl; // rotate left, C++17+
  cout << "a ror b: " << rotr(a, b) << endl; // rotate right, C++17+
#else
  // For earlier versions of C++, you'd need to write your own rotation function.
#endif
}
```
