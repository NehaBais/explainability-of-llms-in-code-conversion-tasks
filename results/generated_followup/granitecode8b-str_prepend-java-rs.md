The error message indicates that there is an issue with the first line of the Rust code, which attempts to declare a new variable called `let`. This is not valid in Rust, as it does not support implicit variable declaration. To fix this error, we need to assign the value to the variable before attempting to prepend it with another string literal.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
fn main() {
 let mut string = String::from("def");
 string = format!("abc{}", string);
 println!("{}", string);
}
```
In this updated code, we first create a mutable reference to a `String` using the `mut` keyword. We then assign the value `"def"` to the variable using the `=` operator. Finally, we use the `format!` macro to prepend the string with `"abc"`, and print the resulting string to the console using `println!`.
