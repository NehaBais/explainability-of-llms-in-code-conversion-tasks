The error message states that "use of undeclared identifier 'fs'". This means that the compiler has not been able to resolve the identifier 'fs', which is a namespace alias for `std::filesystem`.

To fix this, include the necessary headers at the beginning of the file:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
```

After that, your code should compile correctly.
