The error is because Rust does not allow dots (`.`) as crate name, Rust uses underscores instead. The error message suggests adding `#![crate_name="qwen2_5coder2b_str_append_js_rs"]` to set the crate name. Here's how you can rewrite the code in a single code block:

```rs
fn main() {
    let mut s1: String = "Hello".to_string();
    s1 += ", World!";
    println!("{}", s1);
}
```
