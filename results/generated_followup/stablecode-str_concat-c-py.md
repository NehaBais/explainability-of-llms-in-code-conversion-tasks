The error `SyntaxError: unmatched ')` is caused by an issue with the string literal in the function call. The backticks (`) are not properly balanced, causing a syntax error.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the string literals are properly matched using single or double quotes. In this case, the issue lies with the use of backticks (`). To resolve this, we can either switch to regular quotes or escape the backticks within the string literal.
In this corrected code, we have switched to regular quotes (`''` and `""`) for the string literals in the function calls. This ensures that the string literals are properly matched with their respective strings.

Here's the entire corrected code in a single fenced code block:
```python
def concat_strings(s1, s2):
    return s1 + s2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = "hello"
    print(f'{s} literal'))
    # or 
    print(f'{s}{" literal"}}')
    
    s2 = concat_strings(s, 'literal'))
    print(s2)
    del s2
```
