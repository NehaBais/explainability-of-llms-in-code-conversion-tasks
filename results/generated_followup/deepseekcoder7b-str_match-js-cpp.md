The error message indicates that the code is using some C++11 language features, which are not supported by GCC 7.4.0. The `auto` keyword and range-based for loops are among them. To fix this issue, you need to use a different compiler with better support for C++11 or downgrade your code to work with an older version of C++.

The corrected code would look like: 
```cpp
for(std::vector<int>::size_type i = 0; i < q2matches.size(); ++i) {
    std::cout << ' ' << q2matches[i];
}
std::cout << '.';
```
This code uses the `std::vector<>::size_type` type to index into `q2matches`, which avoids potential issues with signed-unsigned mismatches. This is a standard fix for handling array indices in C++. The remainder of the error-prone code has been removed or adjusted to work around the errors.
