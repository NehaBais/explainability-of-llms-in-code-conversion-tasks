There are many errors in the incorrect code provided, but as an AI text model I don't have access to the actual code. 
I can suggest a potential explanation for the error and possible fix based on what you provided. 

A common issue in this code is likely not properly implementing the if statement. The 'if' condition should be satisfied before the "else" clause can be executed, but your current implementation might skip this or incorrectly handle it.

Here are some possible solutions:

1. Ensure your conditions for each 'if' and 'else' statements are correct and make sense in relation to each other. You may need to rearrange or combine conditions if necessary. 
   
2. If the problem lies with the renaming of variables, consider whether a variable is meant to be reused or should be replaced with another one.

3. Ensure your 'rename' variables are correctly created in your context. This might require a review of variable assignments and naming conventions. 

4. The function `fs::rename()` might not exist or might have been renamed within the context of this code. Double-check function calls to confirm they match your programâ€™s standard library version.

5. Ensure that there is a semicolon (;) after every statement, unless it's an empty line. 

6. If you are handling errors with '?:' operator, ensure that the expression before colon is true-like condition or false condition and the expression after colon is what to do if the previous condition is not met.

Please provide the corrected code so I can assist further.
