**Error Explanation:** The error is due to an invalid character in the crate name `qwen2.5coder7b_str_interp_js_rs`, specifically the period `.`, which is not allowed.

**Fix Explanation:** Remove the period from the crate name.

Here is the corrected code:

```rs
fn main() {
    let original = String::from("Mary had a X lamb");
    let little = "little";
    let replaced = original.replace("X", little); // creates a new string with the replacement

    println!("{}", replaced);
}
```
