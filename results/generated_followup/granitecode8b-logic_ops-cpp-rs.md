The error is that the `main` function is not defined, which is required for a Rust program to compile. The fix is to define the `main` function, which serves as the entry point of the program. Here's the corrected code:
```rs
fn main() {
    print_logic(true, false);
}
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
```
This code defines the `main` function, which calls the `print_logic` function with the arguments `true` and `false`. The `print_logic` function then prints the result of logical AND, OR, and NOT on the given arguments.
