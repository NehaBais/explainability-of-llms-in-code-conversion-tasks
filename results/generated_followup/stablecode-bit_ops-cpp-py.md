Error: The syntax error is caused by an unmatched right parenthesis ()) at line 6, while there is no corresponding left parenthesis before this error occurs. This indicates that there is a syntax error due to an incorrect placement of parentheses in the given code.

Fix: To fix the above-mentioned syntax error, we need to ensure that all parentheses are properly matched and used correctly. Based on the provided C++ code, it seems like the issue lies with the bitwise NOT operation. The correct syntax for performing a bitwise NOT operation in Python is `~a`, where `a` is the integer you want to perform the bitwise NOT operation on.

Corrected Code:
```py
def bitwise(a, b):
    print("a and b:", a & b)  # Bitwise AND
    print("a or b:", a | b)  # Bitwise OR
    print("a xor b:", a ^ b)  # Bitwise XOR

    print("not a:", ~a))  # Bitwise NOT

    print("a shl b:", a << b))  # Left shift 
```
