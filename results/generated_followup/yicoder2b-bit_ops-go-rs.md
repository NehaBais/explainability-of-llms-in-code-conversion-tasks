The error `E0308` indicates that the type of operation `&`, `|` or `^` is different from its right operand i.e., `i16` and `u8`. This suggests that there is no implementation for these binary operations (`BitAnd<Rhs>`, `BitOr<Rhs>` and `BitXor<Rhs>`) on `i16` for the types `u8`.

The error `E0599` indicates a missing function or associated item named `from_bits` in type `i16`. This suggests that there is no implementation of this function/associated method from `ua>>ub` on `i16`.

A fix can be done by adding the implementations for these operations in `BitAnd`, `BitOr` and `BitXor` traits. Additionally, you can add an associated method `from_be(input: u8) -> i16` (if needed) to convert from bytes to 16-bit signed integers on `i16`.

```rust
use std::ops;

/// Async trait implementations for the bitwise operations with unsigned types.
impl ops::BitAnd<u8> for i16 {}
impl ops::BitOr<u8> for i16 {}
impl ops::BitXor<u8> for i16 {}

/// Async trait implementations for the bitwise operations with signed types, 16-bit.
impl ops::BitAnd<i16> for i16 {}
impl ops::BitOr<i16> for i16 {}
impl ops::BitXor<i16> for i16 {}

/// Async trait implementations for the bitwise operations with signed types, 16-bit.
pub fn from_be(input: u8) -> i16 {
    ((input as u16) << 8 as u16) as i16
}
```
Note that, in this solution, we assume that the `from_bits` method has been implemented for `i16`.
