The error in the code is that it is trying to include files with incorrect syntax. The correct syntax for including a file in C is `<FILENAME>`. Therefore, the lines `#include` and `#include` need to be changed to `#include "stdio.h"` and `#include "dirent.h"`.
 
The fix is to replace the current line with the corrected line as shown above.
 
Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include "stdio.h"
#include "dirent.h"
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    // Rest of the code here
}
```
