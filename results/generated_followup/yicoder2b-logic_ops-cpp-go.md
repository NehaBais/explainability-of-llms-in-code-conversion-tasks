The error `runtime.main_mainÂ·f: function main is undeclared in main package` can be caused by several reasons, but the most likely causes are that the Go compiler does not know where to look for the `main()` function when it is run directly or if there are any import errors and the correct code is not provided.

Here's how to fix it:

1. Ensure your Go code is correct: There should be a main() function in every package. You can define this function anywhere within your package. If you don't see a `main()` function, you may need to add one at the top of your file or use the `-package` directive to indicate that it is the entry point for your program.

2. Write import statements: Go uses imports (specified before the code) in order to fetch and use other packages/libraries required by your functions and variables. If you're missing any import statements, they need to be written under `package main` block or at the top of the file.

3. Check compilation errors: Run your Go code using `go build` command on terminal. The compiler would output all the compiled bytecode and any errors it encounters along with the correct addresses for each function. It will also create a corresponding .exe file if you're running successfully. If there are no errors or the compiled bytecode is present, it means everything is correct.

4. Compiler flags: Use `-o` flag to specify an output file name and `-gcflags=-m` for more detailed error messages. You could also use `-v` to print additional debugging information about Go's internal workings that the compiler may be using. 

Now, here is your corrected code:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	printLogic(true, false)
}

func printLogic(a bool, b bool) {
	fmt.Printf("%v and %v is %v\n", a, b, a && b)
	fmt.Printf("%v or %v is %v\n", a, b, a || b)
	fmt.Printf("not %v is %v\n", a, !a)
}
```
