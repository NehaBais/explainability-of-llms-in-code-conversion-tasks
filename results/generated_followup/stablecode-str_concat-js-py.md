Error: The code contains unmatched parentheses. 

Fix: To resolve this issue, we need to correct the syntax error caused by an unmatched closing parenthesis ()). We can fix this by properly enclosing the print statement within parentheses.

Corrected Code:
```python
s = "hello"
print(s + " there!"))
```
In this corrected code, we have enclosed the entire print statement within parentheses, which resolves the syntax error caused by an unmatched closing parenthesis ()).
