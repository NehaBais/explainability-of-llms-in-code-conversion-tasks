The error occurred because the `main` function is not defined. To solve this, we need to define the main function. The corrected C++ code would look like:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void logic(bool a, bool b) {
  std::cout << "a AND b: " << (a && b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a OR b: " << (a || b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "NOT a: " << (!a) << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    logic(true, true);
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines the `logic` function and then calls it within the `main` function.
