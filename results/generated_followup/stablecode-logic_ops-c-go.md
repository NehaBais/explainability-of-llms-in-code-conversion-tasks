The error occurred due to unexpected parentheses at the end of statements in the original Go code. 

To fix this, we need to remove the unnecessary parentheses at the ends of each printf statement. Here's the corrected code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func printLogic(a bool, b bool) {
    fmt.Printf("a and b is %d\n", a && b))
    fmt.Printf("a or b is %d\n", a || b))
    fmt.Printf("not a is %d\n", !a))
}
```

This corrected code will work as expected, handling boolean logic operations in Go.
