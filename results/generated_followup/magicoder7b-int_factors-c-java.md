 The error is occurring because `dvsr` is out of scope after the for loop ends, so you can't use it inside an if statement that comes afterwards. 

To fix this, declare `dvsr` outside of the for loop (before the first opening brace), then change the if condition to `if ((dvsr * dvsr) == num)`. This way, `dvsr` won't go out of scope until after the whole function has been executed.

The corrected code would look like this:

```java
public static Factors getFactors(Factors factors, int num) {
    int list[] = new int[301];
    int ix = 0;
    for (int dvsr = 1; dvsr * dvsr < num; dvsr++) {
        if (num % dvsr != 0) continue;
        
        factors.addFactor(dvsr);
        list[ix++] = num / dvsr;
    }
    
    if ((dvsr * dvsr) == num) {
        factors.addFactor(dvsr);
    }
    
    return factors;
}
```
