The error occurs because the C standard library does not have a predefined `main` function, which is required as the entry point of a C program.

To fix this issue, we need to define our own `main` function with a return type of `int`. Inside it, we can call the `print_logic` function with appropriate arguments. Here's the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void print_logic(int a, int b) {
  printf("%d\n", a && b);
  printf("%d\n", a || b);
  printf("%d\n", !a);
}

int main() {
  int a = 1; // true
  int b = 0; // false
  
  print_logic(a, b);

  return 0;
}
```
