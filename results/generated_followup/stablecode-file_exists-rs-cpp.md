The error is caused by two issues: using C++11 features without enabling them, and not including the necessary header for the filesystem library (`<filesystem>`). 

To fix this issue, we need to enable C++11 features by adding `-std=c++11` or higher flag when compiling with g++, and include the necessary header for the filesystem library.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include 
#include 
using namespace std::filesystem;
int main() 
{
  for (const auto &file : {"input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", "/docs"}) {
    if (exists(file)) {
      if (is_directory(file))) {
        cout << file << " is a directory." << endl;
      } else {
        cout << file << " is a file." << endl;
      }
    } else {
      cout << file << " does not exist." << endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This code will correctly check for the existence of files and directories, and determine whether each item is a directory or a file.
