 The error is due to the fact that `malloc` and `free` are not implicitly declared in C without including the appropriate header file `<stdlib.h>`. Additionally, there was an issue with concatenating strings where the length calculation for `s1` did not account for the null terminator of the string literals being concatenated.

The fix is to include the header `<stdlib.h>` and ensure that memory allocation includes space for the null terminator. Here is the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  // Create a string variable equal to any text value
  char *s = strdup("hello");
  printf("%s\n", s);

  // Create another string variable whose value is the original variable
  // concatenated with another string literal
  size_t len = strlen(s) + strlen(" world") + 1; // Length of " world" plus null terminator
  char *s1 = (char *)malloc(len);
  if (s1 == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
    return 1;
  }

  strcpy(s1, s);
  strcat(s1, " world");
  printf("%s\n", s1);

  // Free the allocated memory for s1
  free(s1);

  return 0;
}
```
