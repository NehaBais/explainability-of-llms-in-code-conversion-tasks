The error is that the compiler cannot find the headers for the `std::string` and `std::cout` functions, as well as the `main()` function. To fix this, we need to add the necessary include statements at the beginning of the file.
Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include
#include
int main() {
  std::string s = "World";
  s.insert(0, "Hello ");
  std::cout << s << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this corrected version, we have added the necessary include statements for the `std::string`, `std::cout`, and `main()` functions. The code should now compile without errors.
