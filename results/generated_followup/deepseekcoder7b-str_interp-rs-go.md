The error occurs because of incorrect usage of backticks (`` ` ``) and invalid characters are present in placeholder formatting like "Mary had a %v lamb" or "%s had a %s lamb". 

The fix is to replace the placeholders with valid Go syntax.

Here's the corrected code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Mary had a %v lamb\n", "little")  // You can specify order
    fmt.Printf("%v had a %v lamb\n", "Mary", "little")  
    
	s := map[string]interface{}{"name": "Mary", "adj":"little"}
	fmt.Printf("%s had a %s lamb\n", s["name"], s["adj"]) // Or named arguments if you prefer
}
```
