 The error is occurring because the C compiler doesn't have implicit declarations enabled, which means it does not recognize functions like `strrchr` or `stat`, causing the compilation to fail.

To fix this, you need to include necessary headers that contain these function prototypes, and ensure your implementation includes them. Here is the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h> // for strrchr, strlen and strncpy

// Create directory and its parent directories if they don't exist
int create_dir(char *path) {
  char *p = strrchr(
      path, '/'); // Find the last slash in the path (parent directories)
  
  mkdir(path, 0755);

  return 0;
}
```

In this code, we have included `<string.h>` which includes prototypes for functions like `strrchr` and `strlen`, and `<unistd.h>` which includes the `mkdir` function. The `create_dir` function now creates a directory at the specified path.
