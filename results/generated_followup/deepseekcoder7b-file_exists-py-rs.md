The error message indicates that `assert` macro is not defined within an item, it's being used as an expression instead of a statement (item). In Rust, macros are denoted with double colon prefix (e.g., `println!()` or `vec![1, 2, 3]`), while functions are prefixed with single colon (e.g., `println()` or `sum_vector(v: &Vec<i32>) -> i32`). In Rust, assertions should be used in the test module and not as a standalone expression.

The fix is to use an if statement instead of the macro for clearer understanding that it's an assertion. 

Here is the corrected version:

```rs
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn check_file_exists(filename: &str) -> bool {
    let path = Path::new(filename);
    return match path.exists() && path.is_file() { 
        true => true, 
        false => false};
}

fn check_directory_exists(dirname: &str) -> bool {
    let path = Path::new(dirname);
    return match path.exists() && path.is_dir() {
        true => true, 
        false => false};
}
// for current working directory
assert!(check_file_exists("input.txt"));
assert!(check_directory_exists("docs"));

// for file and a directory in the filesystem root ("/" as Unix convention)
if check_file_exists("/input.txt") {println!("File exists.")} else {println!("File does not exist.")};
if check_directory_exists("/docs") {println!("Directory exists.")} else {println!("Directory does not exist.")}; 
```
The reason that the absolute path to the root of a file system is not directly supported by Rust Path API, would be because it's considered as an edge case and may require complex manipulation (like parsing) for the `root` directory. Therefore in most cases, you will use paths relative to the current working directory.
