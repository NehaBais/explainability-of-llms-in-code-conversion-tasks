The error occurs due to incorrect syntax while defining multiple conditions for checking if a number is less than, equal to or greater than another number. 

The fix involves using correct Go syntax for defining conditions and executing print statements based on the comparison of two numbers.

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin))

	nbr1, _ := strconv.Atoi(reader.ReadString('\n'))[:len(reader.ReadString('\n')))-1])
	nbr2, _ := strconv.Atoi(reader.ReadString('\n'))[:len(reader.ReadString('\n')))-1])

	if nbr1 < nbr2 {
		fmt.Println(nbr1, "is less than", nbr2))
	} else if nbr1 > nbr2 {
		fmt.Println(nbr1, "is greater than", nbr2))
	} else {
		fmt.Println(nbr1, "is equal to", nbr2))
	}
}
```
This code takes two numbers as input from the user and then checks which operator is used based on the comparison of those two numbers. Depending on the result of each condition, it prints out a suitable message indicating whether the first number is less than, equal to or greater than the second number.
