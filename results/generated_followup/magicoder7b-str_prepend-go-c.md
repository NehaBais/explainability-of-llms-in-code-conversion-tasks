 The error is caused by the C compiler not being able to automatically recognize that these functions (strncpy, strncat, strlen) exist as part of string.h library. This limitation in ISO C99 standards was removed in later standards, but compilers are not required to support them in earlier ones.

The fix is to include the string header <string.h>. Including this header automatically declares these functions for us and thus we don't need to declare them manually anymore.

Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h> // Include the string library
#define MAX_SIZE 256
char s[MAX_SIZE];

int main() {
  char string1[] = "world!";
  strncpy(s, "Hello, ", MAX_SIZE); // Prepend the constant string to `s`
  strncat(s, string1, MAX_SIZE - strlen(s)); // Append the second string to `s`

  printf("%s\n", s); // Print the result

  return 0;
}
```
