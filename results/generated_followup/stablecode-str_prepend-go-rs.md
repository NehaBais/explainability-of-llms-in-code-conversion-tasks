The error is due to an unclosed delimiter, which was left open at the end of the previous lines.

To fix this issue, you need to close all opened delimiters on each line except for the one that contains the error.

The corrected code is as follows:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = "world!".to_string();
    let hello = "Hello, ".to_string();
    s = format!("{}{}", hello, s));

    println!("{}", s));
}
```
The corrected code now includes the necessary closing delimiters on each line, including the one that contains the error.
