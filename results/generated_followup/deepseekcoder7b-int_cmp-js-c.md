The error message is saying that there are some characters not allowed like '|' (or) and special unicode characters which C does not recognize, also it expects expressions after if-else statements. 

To fix the issue, remove those character and correcting syntax errors as per the standard C programming language formatting. Here is the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1, num2;
    char buffer[256];  // to store user input temporarily

    printf("Enter the first integer: ");
    fgets(buffer, 256, stdin);    // get user input into a string
    sscanf(buffer, "%d", &num1);  // convert that string to an int

    printf("Enter the second integer: ");
    fgets(buffer, 256, stdin);
    sscanf(buffer, "%d", &num2);

    if (num1 == num2) {
        printf("%d equals %d\n", num1, num2);
    } else if (num1 < num2) {
        printf("%d is less than %d\n", num1, num2);
    } else {
        printf("%d is greater than %d\n", num1, num2);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This corrected code removes the special characters and adjusts the syntax as per C programming language standards. It will now run without any error or warning.
