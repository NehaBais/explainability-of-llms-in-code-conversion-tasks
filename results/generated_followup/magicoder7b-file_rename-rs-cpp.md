 The error occurred because C++ does not recognize "std::filesystem". To use filesystem functions, we need to include <filesystem>, which was added in C++17 standard. 

To fix this issue, you can add the -std=c++17 flag or later while compiling your C++ code. If you are using a compiler that supports it (like g++ or clang++), you should be able to add the following flags: `-std=c++17` or `-std=c++2a`.

Here is the corrected C++ code:
```cpp
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

int main() {
  try {
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs");
    fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
  } catch (const std::filesystem::filesystem_error &e) {
    std::cerr << "File move error: " << e.what() << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
