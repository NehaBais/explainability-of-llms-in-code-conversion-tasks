The error `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')` is occurring because of an unbalanced parentheses in the JavaScript code.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the extra closing parenthesis on line 23 of the code.

Here is the corrected JavaScript code:

```js
const fs 
= require('fs');
const path 
= require('path');

function renameFile(src, dest) 
{
    try 
    {
        fs.renameSync(src, dest);
        console.log(`Renamed ${src} to ${dest}}`);
    } catch (err) 
    {
        console.error(err);
    }
}

const inputFile 
= 'input.txt';
const outputFile 
= 'output.txt';
const docsDir 
= 'docs';
const myDocsDir 
= 'mydocs';


// Rename in the current working directory
renameFile(inputFile, outputFile);


// Rename in a different working directory
const rootDir 
= '/';
const inputFileRoot 
= path.join(rootDir, inputFile));;
const outputFileRoot 
= path.join(rootDir, outputFile));;
const docsDirRoot 
= path.join(rootDir, docsDir)));
const myDocsDirRoot 
= path.join(rootDir, myDocsDir)));
renameFile(inputFileRoot, outputFileRoot);
renameFile(docsDir, myDocsDir);
renameFile(inputFileRoot, outputFileRoot);
renameFile(docsDirRoot, myDocsDirRoot);
```
The above code is written in JavaScript and performs the same operation as the given Golang code.

This JavaScript code uses Node.js built-in 'fs' (file system) module and 'path' module to perform file renaming operations in a similar manner as it would be done using Golang's `os` package.

The above code first defines a function called `renameFile()`, which takes two parameters - source file path and destination file path.

Inside the `renameFile()`, the built-in 'fs' module'`renameSync()` method is used to perform the file renaming operation. The method also accepts an optional callback function parameter which can be used to handle any errors that may occur during the file renaming operation.

After defining the `renameFile()` function, the code then defines some constants representing different file paths and directory names.

Finally, the code calls the `renameFile()` function twice - once with the current working directory file paths and once with the filesystem root directory file paths. The `renameFile()` function is called twice with different source and destination file paths.
