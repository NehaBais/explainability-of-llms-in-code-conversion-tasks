The error message indicates that there are several issues with the code, including undefined variables, missing headers, and undeclared functions. The fix is to define the necessary variables, include the required header files, and declare any functions or types used in the code. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the correct syntax is used for C programming language constructs.
Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;
vector factors(int num) {
  vector n_factors;
  int i;
  for (i = 1; i <= sqrt(num); i += 1) {
    if (num % i == 0) {
      n_factors.push_back(i);
      if (num / i != i) {
        n_factors.push_back(num / i);
      }
    }
  }
  sort(n_factors.begin(), n_factors.end()); // numeric sort
  return n_factors;
}
int main() {
  int num = 16;
  vector factors = factors(num);
  cout << "[";
  for (int i = 0; i < factors.size(); i++) {
    if (i > 0) {
      cout << ", ";
    }
    cout << factors[i];
  }
  cout << "]" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this corrected code, the necessary header files are included, and the undefined variables are declared. The `sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root of a number, and the `push_back` function is used to add elements to a vector. The `sort` function is used to sort the elements of a vector in ascending order. Finally, the main function is defined to test the `factors` function by calculating the factors of a given number and printing them to the console.
