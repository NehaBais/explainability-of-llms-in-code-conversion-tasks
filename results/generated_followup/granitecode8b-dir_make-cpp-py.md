The error in the given code is that it contains an extra `return` statement after the `try-except` block. This causes the code to fail with an IndentationError because the `try-except` block is not indented properly.
The fix is to remove the extra `return` statement.
Here's the corrected code:
```py
import os
def mkdir_p(path):
 if os.path.exists(path):
 return
 try:
 os.makedirs(path)
 except OSError as e:
 # Mask any errors that result from the directory existing
 if e.errno != 17:
 raise
```
This code defines a function `mkdir_p()` that takes a single path string as an argument and creates all the necessary directories along the given path. If the directory already exists, it returns successfully without doing anything. Otherwise, it attempts to create the directory using the `os.makedirs()` function. If this fails due to any errors other than the directory already existing, it raises an exception.
