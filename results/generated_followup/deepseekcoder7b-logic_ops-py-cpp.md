The error occurred because there is no `main()` function which is essential for C++ programs to run.

The fix is adding a `main()` function that calls the `logic()` function with two boolean values as arguments. 

Here is the corrected version of code - 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void logic(bool a, bool b) {
    cout << "a && b: " << (a && b) << endl;
    cout << "a || b: " << (a || b) << endl;
    cout << "!a: " << (!a) << endl;
}

int main() {
    logic(true, false);  // Call the function with two boolean values.
    return 0;
}
```
