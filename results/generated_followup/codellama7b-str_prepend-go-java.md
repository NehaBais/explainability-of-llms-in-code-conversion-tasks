The error in the code is caused by the use of backticks ``` to enclose the Java code. Backticks are used for escaping characters in Go, but they are not recognized as valid syntax in Java.

To fix the error, we can replace the backticks with double quotes ". Here's the corrected code:
```java
String s = "world!";
s = "Hello, " + s;
```
This code will compile and run successfully in Java.
