The error occurs because there is no main function defined in Go language, which is the entry point for any program in Go.

A fix to this would be defining a main function where execution of our code starts:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func logic(a bool, b bool) {
	fmt.Println("a AND b: ", a && b)
	fmt.Println("a OR b: ", a || b)
	fmt.Println("NOT a: ", !a)
}

func main() {
    logic(true, false) // or any other boolean values you like
}
```
In the above code, we have added a main function and called our logic function inside it to test its functionality.
