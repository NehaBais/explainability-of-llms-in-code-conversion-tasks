**Error Explanation:** The error occurred because the file name or module name (`qwen2.5coder7b_str_prepend_java_rs`) contained an invalid character `.` which is not allowed in Rust identifiers.

**Fix:** Rename the file to remove the invalid characters.

Here's the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut string = String::from("def");
    string = "abc".to_string() + &string;
}
```
