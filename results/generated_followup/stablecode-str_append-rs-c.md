The error is caused by several issues: unknown type name 'fn', use of undeclared identifiers 'let', 'hello', and 'println'.

To fix these errors, we need to rewrite the C code as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char hello[20];
    strcpy(hello, "Hello world");
    strcat(hello, "!!!!");
    printf("%s\n", hello);

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected code uses the `<stdio.h>` and `<string.h>` libraries to handle strings and their manipulation methods.

In this corrected code, we declare a character array called `hello` with a size of 20 characters. We then use functions like `strcpy` and `strcat` to manipulate the contents of the `hello` string array. Finally, we print out the final string value using the `printf` function.
