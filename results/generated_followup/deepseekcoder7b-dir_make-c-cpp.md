The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find `std::filesystem` namespace, which is part of C++17 standard library features. To use this feature, we need to enable it with a flag like -std=c++17 or later in compilation command. 

The fix would be to enable C++17 feature while compiling the code. The corrected version of the code is identical to what was provided, except for the compilation command.
