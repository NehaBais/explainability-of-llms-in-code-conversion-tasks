Error: Use of undeclared identifier 'cout', 'cin' or both.
Fix: Include the necessary headers and use the correct function names for input/output.
Rewritten code:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
  int a, b;
  cout << "Enter two integers: ";
  cin >> a >> b;

  if (a < b) {
    cout << a << " is less than " << b << endl;
  } else if (a == b) {
    cout << a << " is equal to " << b << endl;
  } else {
    cout << a << " is greater than " << b << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that there are undeclared identifiers in the code, which means that the compiler cannot find the functions or variables used. This could be because the headers required for these functions (e.g., `iostream` in C++) have not been included.
To fix this, we need to include the necessary header files before using the functions `cout` and `cin`. For example, if we want to use `cout`, we need to include the header file `<iostream>`. Similarly, if we want to use `cin`, we need to include the header file `< cin>`.
After including the required headers, we can use the correct function names for input/output. In this case, we used `cout` for printing output and `cin` for taking input from the user.
Finally, we can rewrite the corrected code in a single code block by combining all the necessary code into one.
