The error message indicates that there are missing header files for the `printf`, `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcat` functions, as well as an undeclared library function error. To fix this issue, you need to include the appropriate header file for each of these functions in your C code. Additionally, the syntax for concatenating strings using the `+` operator may not be correct, so you will need to use the `strcat` or `sprintf` function instead.
Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include
int main() {
 char s1[] = "hello";
 printf("%s world", s1);
 char s2[strlen(s1) + 6]; // add 6 for length of " world"
 strcpy(s2, s1);
 strcat(s2, " world");
 printf("%s", s2);
 return 0;
}
```
