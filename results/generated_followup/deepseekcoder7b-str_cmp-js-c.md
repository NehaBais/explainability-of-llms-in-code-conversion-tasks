The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find 'stdio.<begin_of_sentence>' which is not recognized as a valid header file by the preprocessor. 

To fix this, we need to replace `#include <stdio.<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>` with `#include <stdio.h>`. The standard input/output library in C programming language (stdio.h) provides functions for performing input and output. It includes functions like printf(), scanf() etc. 

Here is the corrected code:

```c
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
   // Comparing two strings for exact equality
   printf("%d\n", strcmp("abcd", "abcd"));  // true, prints 0

   // Comparing two strings for inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality)
   printf("%d\n", strcmp("ABCD", "abcd"));  // false, not zero

   // Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other
   printf("%d\n", strcmp("abcd", "dcba"));  // true, less than 0

   // Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after than the other
   printf("%d\n", strcmp("dcba", "abcd"));  // false, not less than zero

   char str1[] = "ABCD";
   char str2[] = "abcd";

   int len = strlen(str1);
   for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
     str1[i] = toupper((unsigned char)str1[i]);
     str2[i] = toupper((unsigned char)str2[i]);
   }

   // Case insensitive comparison
   printf("%d\n", strcmp(str1, str2));  // true, prints zero

   return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>0;
}
```
