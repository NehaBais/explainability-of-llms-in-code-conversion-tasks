Error: The `sprintf` function is not declared in the standard C library, so we need to include the header file `<stdio.h>` or provide an explicit declaration for it.
Fix: Include the header file `<stdio.h>` and declare the `sprintf` function as `extern`.
```c
#include
int main() {
  char str[] = "Mary had a %s lamb";
  char txt[] = "little";
  char out[100];

  extern int sprintf(char *, const char *, ...); // Declare sprintf as external
  sprintf(out, str, txt); // Call sprintf to perform string interpolation
  printf("%s", out); // Print the result

  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurs because `sprintf` is not a built-in function in C. To use it, we need to include the header file `<stdio.h>`, which declares the `sprintf` function as an external function. By declaring `sprintf` as external, we ensure that the compiler can find the definition of this function and use it properly. The fix simply includes the header file and declares `sprintf` as external, resolving the error.
