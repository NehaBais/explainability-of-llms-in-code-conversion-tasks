Rust is more strict than C regarding types. For example, it doesn't allow division by zero for integers or floating-point numbers directly in the printf function in Rust like in C (in this case you have to cast your divisor to `int` and handle possible errors). It also doesn't support direct modulus operations between different types like in C. To achieve similar behavior as in C, you can use the absolute value of one operand or both in Rust.

```rust
fn main() {
    if args.len() < 2 {
        println!("Please provide two operands.");
        return;
    }
    let a: i32 = args[1].parse().unwrap();
    let b: i32 = args[2].parse().unwrap();
    println!("The sum of {} and {} is {}", a, b, a + b);
    println!("The difference between {} and {} is {}", a, b, a - b);
    println!("The product of {} and {} is {}", a, b, a * b);
    // In rust, division truncates towards zero by default. To indicate towards negative infinity or positive infinity, you can use the option enum in the printf function.
    println!("The quotient of {} divided by {} is {:?}", a, b as i32, a / b);
    // Rust does not have a direct equivalent for C's modulus operator. Hence we use a workaround using absolute values and then applying the modulus operation between them.
    let sign_a = a.abs() / a;
    let sign_b = b.abs() / b;
    if (sign_a < 0 && sign_b > 0) || (sign_a > 0 && sign_b < 0) {
        println!("The modulus of {} and {} is {}", a, b, a % b);
    } else {
        println!("The modulus of {} and {} does not have the same sign", a, b);
    }
}
```
