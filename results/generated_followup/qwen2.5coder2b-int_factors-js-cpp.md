The error occurs because `operator<<` is not defined for a vector of integers. To fix this, you can use the `std::to_string` function to convert each integer in the vector to a string before printing it. Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    
    for (const auto& i : v) {
        std::cout << std::to_string(i) << " ";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
