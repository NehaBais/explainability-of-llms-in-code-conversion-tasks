The error message indicates that the `free` function is not recognized by the compiler, which means it has not been included in the compilation options or headers. To fix this issue, you need to include the `<stdlib.h>` header file.

Here's how you can do it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  char *a = "abc";
  char *b = "Bac";

  // comparing exact equality
  if (strcmp(a, b) == 0) {
    printf("The strings are equal\n");
  } else {
    printf("The strings are not equal\n");
  }

  // comparing inequality (inverse of equality)
  if (strcmp(a, b) != 0) {
    printf("The strings are not equal\n");
  } else {
    printf("The strings are equal\n");
  }

  // comparing lexically ordered before
  if (strcmp(a, b) < 0) {
    printf("The first string is lexically before the second\n");
  } else if (strcmp(a, b) == 0) {
    printf("The strings are not lexically before or equal to each other\n");
  } else {
    printf("The first string is lexically after the second\n");
  }

  // comparing lexically ordered after
  if (strcmp(a, b) > 0) {
    printf("The first string is lexically after the second\n");
  } else if (strcmp(a, b) == 0) {
    printf("The strings are not lexically after or equal to each other\n");
  } else {
    printf("The first string is lexically before the second\n");
  }

  // case-insensitively:
  char *a2 = strdup(a);
  char *b2 = strdup(b);

  // compare case insensitively
  if (strcasecmp(a2, b2) == 0) {
    printf("Both strings are equal when ignoring case\n");
  } else {
    printf("The strings are not equal when ignoring case\n");
  }

  free(a2);
  free(b2);

  return 0;
}
```

In the corrected code, we have included `<stdlib.h>` at the beginning to define the `free` function. Additionally, we use `strdup` to create copies of the strings for comparison, as ` strdup` is a standard C function that duplicates the string.
