The error occurs because Rust requires a `main` function as entry point to the program, which is missing in your provided code. The main function must be defined for rustc to compile the program successfully.

To fix this, we need to add a `main` function that calls our `print_logic` function with sample boolean values:

```rs
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}

fn main() {
    let a = true;
    let b = false;
    print_logic(a, b);
}
```
