The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the `printf` and `scanf` functions, which are part of the C standard library. To fix this, we need to include the appropriate header file for I/O operations and declare the `printf` and `scanf` functions explicitly. The corrected code is shown below:
```c
#include 
int main() {
 int a, b;
 printf("Enter two integers: ");
 scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
 if (a < b) {
 printf("%d is less than %dn", a, b);
 } else if (a == b) {
 printf("%d equals %dn", a, b);
 } else {
 printf("%d is greater than %dn", a, b);
 }
 return 0;
}
```
The header file `` provides the declarations for the `printf` and `scanf` functions. The `return 0;` statement at the end of the `main` function indicates that the program has executed successfully.
