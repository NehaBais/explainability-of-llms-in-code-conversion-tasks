The error in the given code is that it does not include the necessary header files for file I/O and stat functions.

After including these headers, the corrected code would look like this:
```c
#include 
#include 
int main() {
  FILE *file;
  struct stat sb;
  if (stat("output.txt", &sb) == -1) {
    file = fopen("output.txt", "w");
    fclose(file);
  }
  if (stat("/output.txt", &sb) == -1) {
    file = fopen("/output.txt", "w");
    fclose(file);
  }
  mkdir("docs", 0755);
  mkdir("/docs", 0755);
  return 0;
}
```
Note that the `mkdir` function does not have a prototype declaration in the given code, so we need to include the appropriate header file for system calls.
