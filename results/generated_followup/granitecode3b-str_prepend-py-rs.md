Error: `char` expected, found `&str`
 Fix: Enclose the string literal "0" with single quotes instead of double quotes to create a character literal.
 Corrected code:
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("12345678");
    s.insert(0, '0');
    println!("{}", s);
}
```
 Explanation: The error occurs because the `insert()` method in Rust requires a character literal as its second argument, but the given code snippet uses a string literal. To fix this issue, we enclose the string literal "0" with single quotes to create a character literal, which will allow the method to accept it as an argument.
