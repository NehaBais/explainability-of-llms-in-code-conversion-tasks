Error: Call to undeclared library function 'printf' with type 'int (const char *, ...)'; ISO C99 and later do not support implicit function declarations
Fix: Include the header <stdio.h> or explicitly provide a declaration for 'printf'
Corrected Code:
```c
#include 
void logic(int a, int b) {
  printf("a AND b: %d ", a && b);
  printf("a OR b: %d ", a || b);
  printf("NOT a: %d", !a);
}
```
Explanation of the error and fix:
The error occurs because the C compiler is not aware of the 'printf' function, so it cannot implicitly declare it. To fix this, we need to include the header file <stdio.h> or explicitly provide a declaration for 'printf'. By doing so, we can use the printf function in our code without any errors.
