**Error Explanation:** The error is due to an invalid character in the crate name `qwen2.5coder7b_str_interp_py_rs`, specifically the period `.` which is not allowed.

**Fix Explanation:** Remove the period from the crate name.

Here is the corrected code:

```rs
fn main() {
    let extra = "little";
    let new_str = format!("Mary had a {} lamb.", extra);
    println!("{}", new_str);
}
```
