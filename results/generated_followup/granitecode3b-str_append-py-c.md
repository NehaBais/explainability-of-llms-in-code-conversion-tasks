Error: The code is trying to use the `strcat` function, which is not declared in the standard C library. To fix this error, we need to include the header file `<string.h>`, which declares the `strcat` function.
```c
#include 
int main() {
  char str[] = "12345678";
  strcat(str, "9!");
  printf("%s", str);
  return 0;
}
```
Fix: We have included the header file `<string.h>` and used the `strcat` function to append the string literal `"9!"` to the end of the `str` variable.
