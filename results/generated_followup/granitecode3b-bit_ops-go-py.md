The error is that the backticks are used for syntax highlighting instead of syntax formatting. To fix this, simply delete the backticks around the code and wrap it in triple quotes to preserve the formatting. 
Here's the corrected code:
```py
package main
import fmt
def bitwise(a, b):
 print(f"a:   {bin(a)}")
 print(f"b:   {bin(b)}")

 # Bitwise logical operations
 print(f"and: {bin(a & b)}")
 print(f"or:  {bin(a | b)}")
 print(f"xor: {bin(a ^ b)}")
 print(f"not: {bin(~a)}")

 if b < 0:
 print("Right operand is negative, but all shifts require an unsigned right operand (shift distance).")
 return

 # Logical shifts (unsigned left operand)
 print(f"shl: {bin(a << b)}")
 print(f"shr: {bin(a >> b)}")

 # Arithmetic shifts (signed left operand)
 print(f"las: {bin(a << b)}")
 print(f"ras: {bin(a >> b)}")

 # Rotations
 print(f"rol: {bin(a << b | a >> (16 - b))}")
 print(f"ror: {bin(a >> b | a << (16 - b))}")
if __name__ == '__main__':
 a, b = -460, 6
 bitwise(a, b)
```
