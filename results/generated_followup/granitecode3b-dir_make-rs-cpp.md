The error in the C++ code is that it tries to include the header file `std` before including the standard library headers. This causes an error because the `std` header file is not included in the C++ standard library. To fix this, you need to include the standard library headers before the `std::filesystem` header.
The corrected code is:
```cpp
#include
#include
#include
int main() {
  std::filesystem::create_directories("./path/to/dir");
  return 0;
}
```
This should work equally well cross-platform and produce the same result as the Rust code.
