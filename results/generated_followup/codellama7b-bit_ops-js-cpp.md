Error: The `>>>` operator is not supported in C++11, but it is supported in later versions of the language (e.g., C++14).

Fix: Replace `a >>> b` with `a >> b`, which performs a logical right shift.

Rewritten code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void bitwise(int a, int b) {
  cout << "a AND b: " << (a & b) << endl;
  cout << "a OR b: " << (a | b) << endl;
  cout << "a XOR b: " << (a ^ b) << endl;
  cout << "NOT a: " << ~a << endl;
  cout << "a << b: " << (a << b) << endl;   // left shift
  cout << "a >> b: " << (a >> b) << endl;   // arithmetic right shift
}
```
