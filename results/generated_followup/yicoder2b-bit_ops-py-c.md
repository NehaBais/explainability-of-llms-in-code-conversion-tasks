Your request appears to be incomplete or incorrect, as it doesn't explicitly mention what Python script or C code the assistant is supposed to convert. I'm unable to provide a specific conversion for these without context. However, here are some general guidelines that might help in your future:

1. Python scripts that use bitwise operations include libraries such as bitarray and bitstring for handling bitwise operations on integers or bytes. 
2. Similarly, C uses bit manipulation techniques to perform the same operations on integers or arrays of bytes.
3. The conversion between these two languages depends heavily on how the original code is written. Some Python operations may not be directly translatable into C, while some might just require modifying the syntax accordingly. 
4. You can run your script in either Python (or any other) environment to see if it runs as intended and get a debug output if necessary.
