The error message indicates that there are missing include statements for the standard string library (`#include`) and the standard I/O library (`#include`). The compiler is also unable to find the identifiers `std`, `strlen`, and `std::cout`.

The error message also suggests that there are issues with the use of the `strlen` function. In C++, this function is replaced by the `std::string::length()` member function, which returns the length of a string without the need for a null terminator. The code can be updated as follows:
```cpp
#include
#include
#include
int main() {
  std::string str = "Good Morning";
  const char *cstr = " to all";
  const char *cstr2 = " !!!";

  // Failure when space allocated to str is insufficient.
  if (str.size() + cstr->length() + cstr2->length() < str.capacity()) {
    // 1st method
    str += cstr;

    // 2nd method
    str += cstr2;

    std::cout << str << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Note that I have replaced `strlen(cstr)` and `strlen(cstr2)` with `cstr->length()` and `cstr2->length()`, respectively. Also, I removed the unnecessary declaration of `x` as it is no longer needed. Finally, I added an additional include statement for the standard I/O library (`#include`) to ensure that the output can be displayed correctly.
