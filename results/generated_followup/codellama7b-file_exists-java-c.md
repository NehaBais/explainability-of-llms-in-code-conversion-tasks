Error: The errors are due to the use of undeclared library functions 'getcwd' and 'access', which are not included in the standard C99 library.
Fix: To fix this issue, you need to include the necessary headers to declare these functions before calling them. You can do this by adding `#include <stdlib.h>` at the top of the file, which will allow you to use the `free` function correctly. Additionally, you should add `#include <unistd.h>` to include the declaration for the `access` function.
Corrected code:
```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void) {
  bool fileExist = false;

  // Verify that a file called input.txt and a directory called docs exist.
  char *currentWorkingDir = getcwd(NULL, 0);
  char *filename = "input.txt";
  if (filename != NULL) {
    if (access(currentWorkingDir, F_OK) == 0) {
      fileExist = true;
    } else {
      printf("The file does not exist.\n");
    }
  }
  free(currentWorkingDir);

  // Verify that a file called input.txt and a directory called docs exist in
  // the filesystem root.
  char *rootDirectory = "/";
  if (filename != NULL) {
    if (access(rootDirectory, F_OK) == 0) {
      fileExist = true;
    } else {
      printf("The file does not exist.\n");
    }
  }
  free(rootDirectory);

  return 0;
}
```
