This problem seems to be related to string manipulation and error handling. Here are the solutions:

1. Correcting Error Messages

- In the first two errors, `Option` type is being used which is a trait for handling values that might not always exist (or can) in your code. For these errors, you should replace `Option` with `Result`, as `Result` is more specific and fits better with the async programming style.
- Error message E0277 implies that str has no size, which doesn't make sense if we're trying to operate on a string character by character. It suggests you should not dereference such expression. You could fix this with `Vec` or `Vec::<_>` where `_` can be a type or nothing.

2. Implementing Traits on str
- Error E0308 implies the size for value types of 'str' cannot be known at compile time. You need to implement Sized trait on str which defines how big the string is. 

3. Correct Error Handling
- When an error occurs, it usually stops execution and gives detailed information about what went wrong with `rustc`. However, the compiler doesn't know how to handle the error until you provide a solution or fix the issue.

4. Rewriting Code Blocks
This code seems to be related to string manipulation and might need a bit of modification to fit this assistant's capabilities. Here is an example:
```rust
let s = "Hello, world";
match s {
    &mut str s if s.is_empty() => println!("String is empty.")
}
```
The `if` condition checks whether the string `s` is mutable and empty (i.e. the string has been changed but not declared as such). If so, it prints a message to the console. This is useful if you want to check if a string changes from being initialized at the start of your program or similar conditions.
