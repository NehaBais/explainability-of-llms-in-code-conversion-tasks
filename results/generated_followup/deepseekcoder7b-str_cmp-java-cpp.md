The error occurs because of incorrect usage of escape sequences (special characters) and undeclared identifiers in C++. The original Java source code uses special Unicode symbols which are not valid in C++, hence the errors. 

To fix this issue, you need to remove the Unicode symbols from your source code. Here is the corrected version of the C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm> // for std::transform

void compare(const std::string &A, const std::string &B) {
  if (A == B) {
    std::cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B << "' are lexically equal.";
  } else {
    std::cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B << "' are not lexically equal.";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  // Case-insensitive comparison: convert both strings to lower case first.
  std::string a = A, b = B;
  std::transform(a.begin(), a.end(), a.begin(), ::tolower);
  std::transform(b.begin(), b.end(), b.begin(), ::tolower);
  if (a == b) {
    std::cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B
              << "' are case-insensitive lexically equal.";
  } else {
    std::cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B
              << "' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  if (A < B) {
    std::cout << "'" << A << "' is lexically before '" << B << "'.";
  } else if (B < A) {
    std::cout << "'" << A << "' is lexically after '" << B << "'.";
  } else { // A and B are not less than each other, so they must be equal.
    std::cout << "'" << A << "' equals to '" << B << "'.";
  }
  
  std::cout << "\nThe lexical relationship is: " << A.compare(B) << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  compare("Hello", "Hello");
  compare("5", "5.0");
  compare("java", "Java");
  compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ");
  compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĵãvá");
  
  return 0; // This is a valid and correct way of returning from main function.
}
```
This corrected code should now compile without any errors. The `std::transform` function used in the case-insensitive comparison allows for conversion to lowercase before comparing strings, ensuring a proper case-insensitive comparison. Furthermore, it checks if both A and B are not less than each other, which means they must be equal (the original Java code had an error here).
