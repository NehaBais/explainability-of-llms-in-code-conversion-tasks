The error is a `SyntaxError` caused by an unmatched closing parenthesis at line 6.

The fix involves removing the extra closing parenthesis in the print statement on line 6. The corrected code block is as follows:
```python
import os
# Get file size for files in current directory
file_path_current = "input.txt"
if os.path.exists(file_path_current)):
    print(os.path.getsize(file_path_current))))
else:
    print("The file '{}' does not exist.".format(file_path_current)))
# Get file size for files in root directory
root_directory = "/"
file_path_root = "input.txt"
full_path = os.path.join(root_directory, file_path_root))
if os.path.exists(full_path)):
    print(os.path.getsize(full_path))))
else:
    print("The file '{}' does not exist in the root directory.".format(file_path_root)))
```
