The error occurs because the `bits.RotateLeft32` and `bits.RotateRight32` functions require an argument of type `int`, but we are passing them a value of type `int32`.

The fix is to cast the integer to its unsigned counterpart before passing it as an argument. Here's the corrected code:

```go
fmt.Printf("A rol b: %d\n", bits.RotateLeft32(uint32(ua), int32(b)))
fmt.Printf("A ror b: %d\n", bits.RotateRight32(uint32(ua), int32(b)))
```

When compiling the corrected code, there should be no errors.
