This is an error that occurs because of type mismatch between the dereferenced type `u8` and type `char` during dereference in the position function for the character `c` in string `s`. This happens because UTF-8 encoding includes sequences of bytes to represent characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), which Rust does not support by default as it's designed to be a general-purpose library language that can handle any Unicode code point including those in the BMP.

Here is the corrected version of your Python code converted into Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = "abcdefgh";
    let n = 2;
    let m = 3;
    let char_ = 'd';
    let chars = "cd";

    // The equivalent Rust slices are obtained by indexing the string with a range [n-1, n+m-1].
    println!("{:?}", &s[n - 1..n + m - 1]);
    // The whole string minus the last character is obtained by slicing [0:-1].
    println!("{:?}", &s[0..s.len() - 1]);
    // Slice from known character.
    let index = s.chars().position(|&c| c == char_).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", &s[index..index + m]);
    // Slice from known substring.
    let index = s.chars().position(|&c| c == *chars.as_bytes()[0]).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", &s[index..index + m]);
}
```
