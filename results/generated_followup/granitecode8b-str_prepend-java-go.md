The error is caused by the fact that Golang requires the package declaration at the top of the file, while Java does not. To fix this, we need to add the `package main` statement at the beginning of the file. Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main
s := "def"
s = "abc" + s
```
In Golang, every source file must be part of a package, so we need to declare the package name at the top of the file using the `package` keyword. Once we add this statement, the code will compile without errors.
