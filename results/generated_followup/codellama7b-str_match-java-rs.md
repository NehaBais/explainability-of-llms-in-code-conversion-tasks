The error message is indicating that the `main` function, which is the entry point of a Rust program, was not found in the crate. This means that the compiler was unable to find a function with the signature `fn main() { ... }` and was unable to execute any code.

To fix this error, you can add a `main` function to your code, like so:
```rs
fn main() {
    let str1 = "abcd";
    let str2 = "ab";

    println!("{}", starts_with(str1, str2)); // true
    println!("{}", ends_with(str1, str2));   // false
    println!("{}", contains(str1, str2));    // true
}
```
This will add a `main` function to your code and allow the compiler to execute it.

Note: In Rust, you can only have one `main` function in your entire program, so make sure that you don't have any other functions with this signature elsewhere in your code.
