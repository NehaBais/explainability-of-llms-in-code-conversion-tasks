Error: The error occurred due to unexpected parentheses at the end of the statement on line 11.

Fix: To fix this issue, remove the unnecessary parentheses at the end of the statement on line 11.

Corrected code:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)

func mkdirp(s string) error {
	return os.MkdirAll(s, 0755))
}

func main() {
	dir := "./path/to/dir"

	err := mkdirp(dir)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("mkdirp:", err)
		return
	}

	// The directory was created successfully,
	// you can now perform operations on this directory here...

	fmt.Println("Directory", dir, "created successfully.")
}
```
