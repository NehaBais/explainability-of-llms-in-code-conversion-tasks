The error occurs because of incorrect usage of `rename()` function call. The error message "expected expression" is due to an issue with special characters used in rename operation. 

The fix for this would be to remove the special character usage and keep only valid C identifiers within string literals.

Now the `rename()` function calls are valid and no errors will occur. The corrected code is provided in a single line below. 

Fixed Code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    if (rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "File move error: input.txt -> output.txt\n");
    }
    if (rename("docs", "mydocs") != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "File move error: docs -> mydocs\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
