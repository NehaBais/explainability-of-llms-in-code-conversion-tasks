The error is that the C++ compiler cannot find the `iostream` header file, which contains the `cout` and `endl` variables. To fix this, we need to include the `iostream` header file at the beginning of our C++ program. The fix is to add `#include "iostream"` before the function definition in the C++ code.
The corrected code is as follows:
```cpp
#include "iostream"
using namespace std;
void logic(bool a, bool b) {
  cout << "a AND b: " << (a && b) << endl;
  cout << "a OR b: " << (a || b) << endl;
  cout << "NOT a: " << (!a) << endl;
}
int main() {
  logic(true, true);   // Output: a AND b: 1, a OR b: 1, NOT a: 0
  logic(false, false); // Output: a AND b: 0, a OR b: 0, NOT a: 1
  return 0;
}
```
Note that the `#include` directive specifies the name of the file to include. If the file is in the same directory as the C++ program, we can simply use `"iostream"` instead of the full path.
