The error message indicates that the compiler does not recognize the `bool` data type, which is used to represent true or false values in C. The `bool` keyword was introduced in C99.

To fix this issue, you need to include the `<stdbool.h>` header file at the beginning of your C program. This header file provides the `bool` data type and several macros that facilitate bitwise operations on boolean variables.

Here's the corrected code block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

void print_logic(bool a, bool b) {
  printf("a and b is %d\n", (a && b));
  printf("a or b is %d\n", (a || b));
  printf("not a is %d\n", (!a));
}
```
