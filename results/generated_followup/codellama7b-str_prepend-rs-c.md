Error: The C compiler is unable to find the `malloc`, `strlen`, and `sprintf` functions, which are not built-in functions in C but rather library functions that need to be linked with the program at compile time.

Fix: To fix this error, you can include the relevant header files for these functions in your code, such as `<stdlib.h>` for `malloc`, `<string.h>` for `strlen`, and `<stdio.h>` for `sprintf`. Additionally, make sure to use the correct function signature for each of these functions, which may involve specifying the type of the arguments and the return value.

Corrected code:
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char *s = "World";
    char *hello_world = malloc(strlen(s) + strlen("Hello ") + 1);
    sprintf(hello_world, "Hello %s", s);
    printf("%s\n", hello_world);
    free(hello_world);
}
```
