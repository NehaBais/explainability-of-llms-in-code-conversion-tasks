The error message indicates that the Rust compiler is unable to find a `main` function in the code. This function is required for the code to compile and run successfully. The fix is to add a `fn main()` function at the end of the code, which will serve as the entry point for the program. The corrected code is shown below:
```rs
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a || b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);
}
fn main() {}
```
This code defines the `logic` function as required, along with the `main` function that serves as the entry point for the program. The `println!` macro is used to print the results of the logical operations.
