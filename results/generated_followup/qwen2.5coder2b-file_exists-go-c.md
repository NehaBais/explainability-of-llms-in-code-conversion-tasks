The error message indicates that the compiler does not know what `struct stat` is because it has not been declared previously. This can happen when the include for `<sys/stat.h>` is missing or the compiler does not have access to this header file.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the `#include <sys/stat.h>` line is present in your C program. You should add it at the beginning of your source code file.

Rewritten corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int verifyFileExistence(const char *path) {
  struct stat file_stat;
  if (stat(path, &file_stat) == 0) {
    return 1; // File exists
  } else {
    return 0; // File does not exist
  }
}

void printStat(const char *path) {
  if (verifyFileExistence(path)) {
    printf("%s is a file\n", path);
  } else {
    printf("%s is a directory\n", path);
  }
}

int main() {
  printStat("input.txt");
  printStat("/input.txt");
  printStat("docs");
  printStat("/docs");
  return 0;
}
```

This corrected code includes the necessary include for `sys/stat.h`, which provides the definition of `struct stat` and other related functions.
