The error in this code is that it's trying to return multiple errors using `err` variable from `mkdirp` function but `mkdirp` does not return any error if all directories were successfully created.

To fix the error, we can change the signature of our `mkdirp()` function so it returns an array of errors instead of a single error and update how we're handling each individual directory creation in the code to be more specific about what went wrong with each directory. Here is the corrected Golang code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"
)

func mkdirp(path string) []error {
	split := strings.Split(path, "/")
	var errors []error
	for i := 0; i < len(split)-1; i++ { // Last element is the directory name we want to create. We don't want it to return an error for existing or non-existing directories.
		part := split[i]
		if _, err := os.Stat(strings.Join(split[:i+1], "/")); err != nil { // Check if the parent directory exists.
			errors = append(errors, fmt.Errorf("Failed to create directory %s: parent directory not found", part))
		} else {
			if _, err := os.Mkdir(part, 0755); err != nil { // Create the directory if it doesn't already exist.
				errors = append(errors, err)
			}
		}
	}
	return errors
}
func main() {
	path := "./path/to/dir"
	errs := mkdirp(path)
	if len(errs) > 0 { // If we had any failures creating directories, print them and exit with a failure status code.
		for _, err := range errs {
			fmt.Printf("Failed to create directory %s: %v\n", path, err)
		}
		os.Exit(1) // Exit with an error status code.
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("Created directory %s\n", path)
	}
}
```
In this updated Golang code:
1. We check if the parent directory of each newly created directory exists first before trying to create it.
2. We don't return an error from `mkdirp` if a directory is successfully created; instead, we append any errors encountered during the process to our array and exit with an error status code if there are any such errors.
