The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the required header files for the `printf`, `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcat` functions. The fix is to include the appropriate header file, such as `stdio.h` or `string.h`, before using these functions. Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include 
#include 
int main() {
  char s[] = "hello";
  printf("%s", s);

  char s1[strlen(s) + strlen(" world") + 1];
  strcpy(s1, s);
  strcat(s1, " world");
  printf("%s", s1);

  return 0;
}
```
Note that the code above assumes that you are compiling the C code using a compiler that supports the `stdio.h` and `string.h` header files. If you are using an older compiler or a different operating system, you may need to include different header files or declare the functions differently.
