Error: `#include` directive not found for file `iostream`.
 Fix: Add `#include "iostream"` directive before using `cout`.
```cpp
#include "iostream"
using namespace std;
int main() {
  string s = "hello";
  cout << s << endl;

  string s1 = s + " world";
  cout << s1 << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
In the Rust code, the `#include` directive is used to include the `iostream` library, which provides input/output stream objects such as `std::cout`. However, in the C++ code, the `#include` directive is not found for the file `iostream`, so a compilation error occurs. To fix this, we need to add the `#include "iostream"` directive before using `cout`.
