The error is due to an invalid character `\` (U+FF5C) at the end of else statement. This can be fixed by removing it.

Here's the corrected code in a single code block:

```py
def compare(a, b):
    print('Comparing strings {0} and {1}:'.format(a, b))
    
    # exact equality 
    if a == b:
        print('- Exact Equality : True')
    else:
        print('- Exact Equality : False')
        
    # inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality)
    if a != b:
        print('- Inequality : True')
    else:
        print('- Inequality : False')
    
    # lexical order
    if a < b:
        print('- Lexically ordered before than the other : True')
    else:
        print('- Lexically ordered before than the other : False')
        
    if a > b:
        print('- Lexically ordered after than the other : True')
    else:
        print('- Lexically ordered after than the other : False')
    
    # case sensitive comparison 
    if a.lower() == b.lower():
        print('- Case Sensitive Comparison : True')
    else:
        print('- Case Sensitive Comparison : False')
        
    # case insensitive comparison 
    if a.upper() == b.upper():
        print('- Case Insensitive Comparison : True')
    else:
        print('- Case Insensitive Comparison : False')
    print("\n")
    
compare("ball", "bell")
compare("ball", "BALL")
compare("YUP", "YEP")
compare("ball", "BELL")
compare("ball", "BALL")
compare("YUP", "yep")
``` 

This code will work correctly. It performs the required operations on strings, including exact equality, inequality, lexical order and case sensitive/insensitive comparison. It also prints out relevant information for each operation.
