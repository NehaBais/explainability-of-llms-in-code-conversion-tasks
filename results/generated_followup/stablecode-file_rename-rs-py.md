The error is "SyntaxError: unmatched ')'". 

Explanation of the error: The error message suggests that there is an issue with the parentheses in the code. Specifically, there are two sets of parentheses that need to be matched correctly.

Fix for the error: To fix this error, ensure that each set of parentheses has a matching closing parenthesis. Additionally, check that there are no extra or missing characters within the parentheses. 

Corrected code:
```python
import os
import shutil

def main():
    try:
        # Rename input.txt to output.txt
        os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt"))

        # Rename docs directory to mydocs
        shutil.move("docs", "mydocs")

        # Rename input.txt to output.txt in the root directory
        os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt"), ignore_error=True)

        # Rename docs directory to mydocs in the root directory
        shutil.move("docs", "mydocs"), ignore_error=True)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"File move error: {str(e)}"))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
