Error: 
- The `#include` directive is not allowed in C code.
- The `printf` function is not declared, so it needs to be provided with a declaration or included from a header file.
- The `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcat` functions are not declared, so they need to be provided with a declaration or included from a header file.
Fix: 
- Remove the `#include` directive since it is not allowed in C code.
- Provide declarations for `printf`, `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcat`.
- Include the required header files for these functions.
Corrected Code:
```c
#include
#include 
 #include 
 
int main() {
  char s[] = "hello";
   printf("%s literal", s);
   char s2[strlen(s) + 6];
   strcpy(s2, s);
   strcat(s2, " literal");
   printf("%s", s2);
   return 0;
 }
```
