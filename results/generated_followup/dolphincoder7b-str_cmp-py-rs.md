The error occurs because Rust requires explicit type annotations for function parameters if they don't match the expected types. In the original Python code, a is inferred as an integer based on the comparison operation (e.g., 5 > 2), but this isn't sufficient in Rust since it cannot determine that the value 5 is actually an integer without explicitly specifying its type. The error also occurs when b is compared to 123 which is treated as a string, not an integer.

To fix this issue, we need to define the types of both variables `a` and `b`. Here's the corrected code:
```rust
fn compare(a: &str, b: &str) {
    let a_type = std::any::type_name::<i32>(a);
    let b_type = std::any::type_name::<i32>(b);

    println!(
         "{} is of type {} and  {} is of type {}",
        a, a_type, b, b_type
    );

    if a < b {
        println!("{} < {}", a, b);
    } else if a > b {
        println!("{} > {}", a, b);
    } else {
        println!("{} == {}", a, b);
    }
}
```
In this corrected code, we explicitly define the types of both variables `a` and `b`. By specifying `i32` as their type, Rust can perform integer comparisons without any issues. Additionally, we use `println!` to print the values of `a`, `b`, `a_type`, and `b_type`.

Note: The Rust standard library provides multiple functions for parsing numeric strings, including parse_int and parse_float. In this example, we are using std::any::type_name as a demonstration only. 

In terms of the error message, the key points are:
- E0601: The `main` function is not found in the crate. You can define your own `main` function or provide a crate-level entry point.
- E0061: This function takes 0 arguments but 1 argument was supplied. In this case, Rust expects a value of type `&str` for parameter `a`. However, you are passing an actual string object (`"24"`) instead. To fix this issue, you need to pass the string as a reference using `&"24"`, which is a syntax sugar for `&&s("24")`.
- E061: Similarly, Rust expects a value of type `&str` for parameter `b`.

By making these changes and using appropriate variable names in the print statements, you should be able to compile the corrected code successfully.
