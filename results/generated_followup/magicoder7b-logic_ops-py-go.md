 The error `runtime.main_mainÂ·f: function main is undeclared in the main package` occurs because Golang doesn't recognize the `logic` function as a valid entry point to the program. The `main` function must be declared with zero arguments and without a return type. 

To fix this, you need to declare a `main` function:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func logic(a, b bool) {
	fmt.Printf("a and b: %v\n", a && b)
	fmt.Printf("a or b : %v\n", a || b)
	fmt.Printf("not a: %v\n", !a)
}

func main() {
    logic(true, false)
}
```
In this corrected code, I have added `main` function which calls the `logic` function with sample input. The `main` function is the entry point to any Golang program and should contain a call to some function - in our case it's the `logic` function. The `logic` function contains the logic of "and", "or" and "not".
