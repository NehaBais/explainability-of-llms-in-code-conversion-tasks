The error message indicates that there are missing header files for `stdio.h` and `sys/stat.h`. The `stat` function is used to check the existence of files and directories, but its declaration is not available in the current scope without including the appropriate header file. To fix this, we need to include the necessary header files at the beginning of the program.
The corrected code can be written as follows:
```c
#include
#include
#include
int main() {
  // Check if input.txt exists in the current working directory
  char *filename = "input.txt";
  struct stat st;
  int rc = stat(filename, &st);
  if (rc == 0) {
    printf("File %s exists in the current working directory.n", filename);
  } else {
    printf("File %s does not exist in the current working directory.n",
           filename);
  }
  // Check if input.txt exists in the root filesystem
  char *filepath = "/input.txt";
  rc = stat(filepath, &st);
  if (rc == 0) {
    printf("File %s exists in the root filesystem.n", filepath);
  } else {
    printf("File %s does not exist in the root filesystem.n", filepath);
  }
  // Check if docs directory exists in the current working directory
  char *dirname = "docs";
  rc = stat(dirname, &st);
  if (rc == 0) {
    printf("Directory %s exists in the current working directory.n", dirname);
  } else {
    printf("Directory %s does not exist in the current working directory.n",
           dirname);
  }
  // Check if docs directory exists in the root filesystem
  char *dirpath = "/docs";
  rc = stat(dirpath, &st);
  if (rc == 0) {
    printf("Directory %s exists in the root filesystem.n", dirpath);
  } else {
    printf("Directory %s does not exist in the root filesystem.n", dirpath);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
