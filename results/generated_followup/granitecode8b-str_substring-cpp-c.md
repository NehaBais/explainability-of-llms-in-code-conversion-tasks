The error was caused by missing header files for `stdio.h` and `string.h`. The fix is to add the necessary include statements at the beginning of the file. The corrected code is as follows:
```c
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 char s[] = "0123456789";
 int n = 3;
 int m = 4;
 char c = '2';
 char sub[] = "456";
 printf("%.*s
", m, s+n);
 printf("%s
", s+n);
 printf("%.*s
", (int)strlen(s)-1, s);
 printf("%.*s
", m, strchr(s, c)+n);
 printf("%.*s
", m, strstr(s, sub)+n);
 return 0;
}
```
