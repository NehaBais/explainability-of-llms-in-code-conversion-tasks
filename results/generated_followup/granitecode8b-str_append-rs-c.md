The error is that the `printf` function is not declared as part of the C standard library, so it must be explicitly included using an include statement at the beginning of the program. The fix is to add the line `#include  before the `int main()` function declaration. Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include
int main() {
  char *hello = "Hello world";
  printf("%s%s", hello, "!!!!");
  return 0;
}
```
