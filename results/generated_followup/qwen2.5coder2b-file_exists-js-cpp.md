The error message indicates that the compiler does not recognize the `CreateObject` function or the `IFileSystemObject` interface. This is typically because C++ does not natively support COM objects like ActiveXObject, which are used for interfacing with Windows-specific APIs.

To fix this issue, we need to use a third-party library such as Boost::filesystem or the Windows API functions directly, which can handle file and directory operations without the need for COM object interaction. Here's how you can rewrite the C++ code using Boost::filesystem:

```cpp
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>
using namespace boost::filesystem;

int main() {
  // File and Directory Verification for current working directory
  try {
    if (exists(current_path() / "input.txt") && exists(current_path() / "docs")) {
      cout << "Files and directories verified in the current directory." << endl;
    } else {
      cerr << "Error verifying files and directories in the current directory." << endl;
      return 1;
    }
  } catch (std::exception &e) {
    cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  // File and Directory Verification for root of the filesystem
  try {
    if (exists("input.txt") && exists("docs")) {
      cout << "Files and directories verified in the system root." << endl;
    } else {
      cerr << "Error verifying files and directories in the system root." << endl;
      return 1;
    }
  } catch (std::exception &e) {
    cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this corrected code, we use Boost::filesystem to check the existence of files and directories. This approach avoids using COM objects, which are generally not supported in C++.
