The error messages suggest that there are undeclared function `atoi()`, and identifier `argv`. These are not functions or identifiers in C language and are not supported by the compiler in C language. 

To resolve this issue, you would need to include the proper headers (like <stdlib.h> for atoi() and <string.h> for using argv) and define your own `atoi()` function as per your requirement. Also, the error `use of undeclared identifier 'argv'` suggests that there might be a mismatch in the number of arguments provided to the program. You need to ensure that you are passing two command-line arguments (as numbers) while running this C code from the terminal.

Here is an example for the corrected version of your code -
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>  // To use strtol() function which is defined in strings.h header file 

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {  // argv contains string arguments from command line
    if (argc != 3) {                 // Ensure there are exactly two arguments
        printf("You must provide two integer arguments\n");
        return -1;                   // Indicate error in the program execution
    }
    int a = strtol(argv[1], NULL, 10); // Convert string to integer (base 10)
    int b = strtol(argv[2], NULL, 10);
  
    int sum = a + b;
    int difference = a - b;
    int product = a * b;
    float quotient = (float)a / b; // Note the use of float for division to avoid integer truncation
    int remainder = a % b; 

    if ((remainder < 0 && a > 0) || (remainder >= 0 && a <= 0)) {
        printf("The sign of remainder does not match the signs of first and second "
               "operands\n");
    } else if (a > b) {
        printf("Towards positive infinity, towards negative zero\n");
    } else {
        printf("Towards negative infinity, towards positive zero\n");
    }
    // The %d syntax is a placeholder that is replaced by the sum, difference, product, quotient and remainder values.
    printf("a + b = %d\na - b = %d\na * b = %d\na / b = %.2f\na %% b = %d\n", sum, 
           difference, product, quotient, remainder);
    return 0; // Indicates successful program execution in C
}
```
