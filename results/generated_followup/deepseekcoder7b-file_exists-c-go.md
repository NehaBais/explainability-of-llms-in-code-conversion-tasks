The error occurs because of incorrect usage of ternary operators in Go as they are not supported directly in Go syntax. The correct way is to use if-else constructs instead. 

The fix for this would be replacing the ternary operator with standard if-else statements which have been correctly implemented throughout the code.

Here's the corrected code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

// Check for regular file. 
func checkReg(path string) bool {
	fileInfo, err := os.Stat(path)
	return err == nil && !fileInfo.IsDir()
}

// Check for directory. 
func checkDir(path string) bool {
	fileInfo, err := os.Stat(path)
	return err == nil && fileInfo.IsDir()
}

func main() {
	if checkReg("input.txt") {
        fmt.Println("input.txt is a regular file.")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("input.txt does not exist or is not a regular file.")
    }
    
    if checkDir("docs") {
        fmt.Println("docs is a directory.")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("docs does not exist or is not a directory.")
    }
	
	if checkReg("/input.txt") {
        fmt.Println("/input.txt is a regular file.")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("/input.txt does not exist or is not a regular file.")
    }
	
	if checkDir("/docs") {
        fmt.Println("/docs is a directory.")
    } else {<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜> {
        fmt.Println("/docs does not exist or is not a directory.")
    }
}
``` 
This should correctly verify if the file and directories "input.txt" in the current working directory and "docs" in the root of the filesystem exist and are either regular files or directories respectively. It also handles scenarios where the file/directory does not exist.
