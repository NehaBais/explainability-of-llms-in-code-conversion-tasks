The error message indicates that there is a type mismatch between characters being used for replacement (`'X'`) and string elements from `originalString` (characters). In C++, strings are represented as sequences of characters, so they can be accessed through an iterator just like in C-style strings.

The fix to the error is to use single quotes (' ') for character literals rather than double quotes (" "). Double quoted string literals denote a sequence of bytes that might include escape sequences. Single quotes represent a single byte value, so they are easier to work with directly as in this case. 

Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm> 

int main() {
    std::string originalString = "Mary had a X lamb.";
    std::replace(originalString.begin(), originalString.end(), 'X', 'big');   // Replaces all occurrences of 'X' with 'big'.
    
    std::cout << originalString << std::endl; 

    return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>0;   // s is the type of 0 in this context, it doesn't make sense to return a value here. The compiler will issue a warning about redundant return statement but it won’t fail compilation. So we are returning nothing which could be represented by `{}` or `;`.
}
```
