The error is caused by Rust's syntax rules. In Rust, crate name cannot have dots (`.`). To correct this, you can specify the crate name directly in `main` function or add `#![crate_name="qwen2_5coder2b_str_prepend_java_rs"]` attribute at the top of your file.

Here is the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut string = String::from("def");
    string.insert_str(0, "abc");
    println!("{}", string);
}
```
This code snippet will create a mutable `String`, prepend it with the string `"abc"`, and then print the resulting string.
