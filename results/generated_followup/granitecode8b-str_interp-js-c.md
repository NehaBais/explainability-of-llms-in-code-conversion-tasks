The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the declaration for three library functions (`strcpy`, `strcat`, and `printf`). This occurs because these functions are not declared in the code, and the compiler does not know where to look for their definitions. The fix is to include the appropriate header files (`<string.h>` and `<stdio.h>`) that provide declarations for these functions.
Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 char original[] = "Mary had a X lamb";
 char little[] = "little";
 char replaced[100];
 strcpy(replaced, original);
 strcat(replaced, " and a ");
 strcat(replaced, little);
 strcat(replaced, " lamb.");
 printf("%s", replaced);
 return 0;
}
```
The entire code is included in the fenced code block, starting with the first line containing `#include` and ending with the last line containing `printf`. The compiler will now be able to find the declarations for `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `printf` as they are provided by the respective header files.
