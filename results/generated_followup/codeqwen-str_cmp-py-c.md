The error occurs because `A` and `B` are undefined variables before they are used in the function `compare()`. The solution to this is to pass the two strings as arguments to the function `compare()` and declare them within the function scope using a local variable `char A[] = "YUP"; char B[] = "YUP";`.

Here's the corrected code:

```c
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void compare(char *A, char *B) {
  printf("\n%s is of type %s and %s is of type %s\n", A, "char*", B, "char*");

  if (strcmp(A, B) < 0) {
    printf("%s Is strictly less than  %s\n", A, B);
  }
  if (strcmp(A, B) <= 0) {
    printf("%s Is less than or equal to %s\n", A, B);
  }
  if (strcmp(A, B) > 0) {
    printf("%s Is strictly greater than  %s\n", A, B);
  }
  if (strcmp(A, B) >= 0) {
    printf("%s Is greater than or equal to %s\n", A, B);
  }
  if (strcmp(A, B) == 0) {
    printf("%s Is equal to %s\n", A, B);
  } else {
    printf("%s Is not equal to %s\n", A, B);
  }

  int result = strcmp(A, B);
  if (result == 0 && !strcmp(A, B)) {
    printf("%s has object identity with %s\n", A, B);
  } else {
    printf("%s has negated object identity with %s\n", A, B);
  }
}

int main() {
  char A[] = "YUP";
  char B[] = "YUP";

  compare(A, B);
  return 0;
}
```
