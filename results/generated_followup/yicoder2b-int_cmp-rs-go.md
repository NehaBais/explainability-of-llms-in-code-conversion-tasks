The error is because you are using "strconv" which has been imported but not used anywhere in your code, so it can be deleted from the code. The error message is not very clear and could refer to different parts of your code or different errors that may be happening at other times in your program. Here is how you can fix this:

```go
// Go Code
func main() {
	var a, b int
	fmt.Printf("Enter the first integer: ")
	if _, err := fmt.Scan(&a); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("Enter the second integer: ")
	if _, err := fmt.Scan(&b); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	if a < b {
		fmt.Printf("%d is less than %d\n", a, b)
	} else if a == b {
		fmt.Printf("%d equals %d\n", a, b)
	} else if a > b {
		fmt.Printf("%d is greater than %d\n", a, b)
	}
}
```
