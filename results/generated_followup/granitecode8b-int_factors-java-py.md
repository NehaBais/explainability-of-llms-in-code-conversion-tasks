The error in the Java code is that it uses ` TreeSet` to store the factors, while the Python code uses `set`. This causes a syntax error in Python because sets are unordered collections in Python. The fix is to change `TreeSet` to `set` in the Python code. Here's the corrected code:
```py
import math
def factors(n):
 factors = set()
 factors.add(n)
 factors.add(1)
 for test in range(int(math.sqrt(n)), 0, -1):
 if n % test == 0:
 factors.add(test)
 factors.add(n // test)
 return factors
```
This code correctly computes the factors of a positive integer using Python's set data structure to store the factors. The `range` function is used to generate the integers from `sqrt(n)` down to 1, and the `if` statement checks if each integer is a factor of `n`. If it is, both the factor and its pair are added to the set of factors.
