The error message indicates that there is an invalid syntax at line 1 within the provided code. The issue arises because the "GET" command has not been defined within the Python programming language. 

To fix this, we can use the `input()` function instead of `GET`. However, in order to be compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3, it is necessary to provide an appropriate prompt message that works in both versions. Additionally, note that the `print` statement in Golang is not equivalent to the `printf` function in Python.

Here's a corrected version of the code:
```python
a = int(input("Enter first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter second integer: "))

print(f"{a} + {b} = {a+b}")
print(f"{a} - {b} = {a-b}")
print(f"{a} * {b} = {a*b}")
print(f"{a} / {b} = {a/b} (truncate towards 0)")
print(f"{a} % {b} = {a%b} (same sign as first operand)")
```
