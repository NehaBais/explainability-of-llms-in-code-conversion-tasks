The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the header files `iostream` and `filesystem`. The missing headers are part of the C++17 filesystem library, which is used in the code snippet provided. To fix this issue, you can add the necessary include statements at the top of your code file.
Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include
#include
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
void mkdir_p(const std::string &path) {
  try {
    fs::create_directories(path);
  } catch (const fs::filesystem_error &e) {
    std::cerr << "Error creating directory: " << e.what() << std::endl;
  }
}
int main() {
  mkdir_p("/tmp/some/path/to/dir");
  return 0;
}
```
In this corrected version, the `iostream` and `filesystem` headers are included at the top of the file using the `#include` directive. This ensures that the necessary definitions for these libraries are available to the compiler, allowing it to successfully compile and run the code.
