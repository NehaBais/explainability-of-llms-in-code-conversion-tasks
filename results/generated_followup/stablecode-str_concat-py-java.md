The error in this Java code is on line 24, where `System.out.println(", ".join(arrayOfStrings))));` is expected to end with a semicolon (`;`)), but it does not. The fix for this issue would be to add a semicolon at the end of that line.
Here's the corrected Java code in a single fenced code block:
```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        //First String Variable
        String s1 = "hello";

        //Printing concatenated string of variable and literal.
        System.out.println(s1 + " world");

        //Second String Variable
        String s2 = s1 + " world";

        //Printing the value of second string variable
        System.out.println(s2);


        //First String Variable for the join operation
        String s3 = "hello";
        String s4 = ", ";
        String[] arrayOfStrings = {s3, "world", "mom"};

        //Printing the content of variables after joining
        System.out.println(", ".join(arrayOfStrings))));
    }
}
```
