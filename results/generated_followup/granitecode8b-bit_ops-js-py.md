The error in the given Python code is that it contains an invalid syntax because of the missing colon at the end of the last line.
The fix for this issue is to add a colon at the end of the last line as follows:
```py
def bitwise(a, b):
 print("a AND b: ", a & b)
 print("a OR b: ", a | b)
 print("a XOR b: ", a ^ b)
 print("NOT a: ", ~a)
 print("a << b: ", a << b) # left shift
 print("a >> b: ", a >> b) # arithmetic right shift
 print("a >>> b: ", a >>> b) # logical right shift
``` 
The corrected code should be written in a single fenced code block.
