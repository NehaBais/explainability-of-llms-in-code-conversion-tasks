The error message "use of undeclared identifier 'EXIT_FAILURE'" is due to incorrect usage of the return value from function calls in C/C++. In C, you typically use the `return 0;` statement at the end of main() or function body as a way of indicating that everything has been successfully executed and the program can terminate. Similarly, you use `EXIT_FAILURE` in C as an equivalent for `return 1;`, which is generally used to indicate that some error has occurred.

However, in the corrected code, there are two return statements, one in each if condition. In C, a function can only have one return statement. If you want to represent both cases (file or directory already exists and creation successful) and (file or directory does not exist and could not be created), then it would make more sense to return values as an enum. Here's how you could structure the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

enum Result {SUCCESS, FAILURE};

int main() {
    /* permissions are before umask */
    const mode_t perms = 0640; /* rights 0640 for rw-r----- */
    // equivalent to opening file
    int fd = open("output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, perms);
    if (fd == -1) { // error occurred
        return FAILURE; // indicating failure
    }
    // equivalent to closing file descriptor
    close(fd);

    /* equivalent to creating directory */
    const int dir_flags = 0750;           /* rights 0750 for rwxr-x--- */
    if (mkdir("docs", dir_flags) == -1) { // error occurred
        return FAILURE; // indicating failure
    }

    return SUCCESS; // indicating success
}
```
This way, the main() function can return multiple types of values. If everything is executed correctly, it returns 0 (indicating success), otherwise it returns a non-zero value to indicate that an error occurred. This way we are able to distinguish between no errors and errors, and also provide more detailed information about what caused an error.
