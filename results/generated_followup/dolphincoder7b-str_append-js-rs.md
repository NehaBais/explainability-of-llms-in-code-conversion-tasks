The error occurs because Rust requires items to be declared before they're used in a module. In this case, the `let mut s1` line is being used without being defined first. To fix this, we need to move the declaration of `s1` earlier in the file or before its use.
To rewrite the corrected code, we can use the following code block:
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut s1  = "Hello".to_string();
    s1.push_str(", World!");
    println!("{}", s1);
}
```
In this code, `s1` is declared before its usage in the `main()` function. This allows the compiler to understand what `s1` is and where it's being used. Additionally, `.push_str()` is now called on a mutable reference (`&mut String`) to the string variable `s1`, instead of an immutable one (`&String`).
