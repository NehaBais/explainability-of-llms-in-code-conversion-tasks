The error occurs because the comparison operator `!=` is not valid for types that are not comparable. In this case, `num1`, which is of type `double`, cannot be compared directly with `str2`, which is a string.

To fix this issue, you need to convert the string `str2` to a double before performing the comparison. Here's how you can modify the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    double num1 = 3.14;
    std::string str2 = "3.14";

    // Convert str2 to double and compare
    if (num1 != std::stod(str2)) {
        std::cout << "true" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "false" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `std::string` variable `str2` and uses `std::stod` to convert it to a double. It then compares this double with the `num1` value, ensuring that both sides of the comparison are of comparable types.
