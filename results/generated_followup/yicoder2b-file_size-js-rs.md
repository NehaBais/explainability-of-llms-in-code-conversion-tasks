Your request requires the conversion of JavaScript to Rust. However, due to context or specific requirements, it's difficult to provide a direct translation without specifics like file paths or exact error messages. 

If you could provide an example of the JavaScript and the Rust code you want to convert for clarity in understanding your specific problem, I would be more than happy to assist!
