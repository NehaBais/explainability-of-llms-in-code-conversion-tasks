Error: The compiler is unable to find the `setfill()` function and the `setw()` function, which are used in the original code to set the fill character for the output stream and to specify the width of the field, respectively.

Fix: To fix this error, we need to include the `<iomanip>` header file, which defines these functions, at the top of our code. This will allow the compiler to recognize the `setfill()` function and the `setw()` function and prevent the errors from occurring.

Corrected Code:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20;
    cout << "Binary representation of " << a << ": ";
    for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
        if ((a & (1 << i)) != 0)
            cout << "1";
        else
            cout << "0";
        if (i % 4 == 0)
            cout << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Binary representation of " << b << ": ";
    for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
        if ((b & (1 << i)) != 0)
            cout << "1";
        else
            cout << "0";
        if (i % 4 == 0)
            cout << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
