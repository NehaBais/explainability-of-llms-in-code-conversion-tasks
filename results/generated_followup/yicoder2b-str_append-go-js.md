The error message suggests that there is an unexpected identifier 'main' in Go code, which is not allowed in JavaScript. The main function definition in JavaScript does not have this problem. 

In the given JavaScript code, `var s = new strings.Builder` is trying to create a new instance of the strings.Builder class from the 'strings' package, but in JavaScript we do not have classes like in Go, so we need to initialize an object directly.

The corrected version of the Go code would look like this:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	s := &strings.Builder{} // Initialize a new strings.Builder instance
	s.WriteString("foo")    // Append "foo" to the instance
	s.WriteString("bar")    // Append "bar" to the instance
	fmt.Println(s.String())  // Print the instance as a string
}
```
This version uses the `new` operator to create a new strings.Builder object and assigns it to the variable `s`, which holds the builder instance. The `WriteString()` method is then used to append "foo" and "bar" to this instance. Finally, the `String()` method is called on the instance and prints out its contents.
