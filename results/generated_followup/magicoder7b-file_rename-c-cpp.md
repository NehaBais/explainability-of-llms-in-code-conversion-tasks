 The error is caused by the use of `std::filesystem` library which was introduced in C++17, but it seems that your compiler does not support C++17 or later versions. This library is used for file system manipulation like renaming and other operations.

The fix would be to either update your compiler to a version that supports C++17 (or later), or use an alternative method of achieving the same functionality if you are restricted from using `std::filesystem`.

Here's how it can be done with `std::rename` function from `<bits/stdc++.h>` library:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    rename("docs", "mydocs");
    rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
  return 0;
}
```
Please note that `std::rename` operates on file paths relative to the current working directory and not using absolute paths. Therefore, you may need to change directories before calling it if your root path is different from your current one. Also, the `std::rename` function doesn't work with the leading slash `/`. It works in relation to the current working directory. If you have to work with absolute file paths, use platform-specific APIs such as `renameat2()`.
