The error is that the `while` loop is not indented properly. The fix is to add four spaces of indentation before the `if` statement in the `while` loop. Here's the corrected code:
```py
stringA = "tacoloco"
stringB = "co"
# stringA starts with stringB
q1 = stringA.startswith(stringB)
# stringA contains stringB
q2 = stringA.find(stringB)
# multiple matches
q2multi = []
i = 0
while True:
 m = stringA.find(stringB, i)
 if m == -1:
 break
 q2multi.append(m)
 i = m + len(stringB)
# stringA ends with stringB
q3 = stringA.endswith(stringB)
print("1: Does '"+stringA+"' start with '"+stringB+"'? " + str(q1))
print("2: Is '"+stringB+"' contained in '"+stringA+"'? " + str(~q2))
if ~q2 and len(q2multi) > 0:
 print("   In fact, it happens "+str(len(q2multi))+" times within '"+stringA+"', at index"+("es" if len(q2multi) > 1 else "")+" "+", ".join([str(i) for i in q2multi])+".")
print("3: Does '"+stringA+"' end with '"+stringB+"'? " + str(q3))
```
The corrected code properly indents the `while` loop so that it is recognized as part of the code block. The `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the second string within the first string, and multiple occurrences are handled by looping through the `find` method until it returns -1. The index of each occurrence is added to a list called `q2multi`. The syntax is also corrected for the `endswith` method, which checks if the first string ends with the second string.
