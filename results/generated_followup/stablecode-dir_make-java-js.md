The error in this code is on line 5, where `if (!fs.existsSync(path))) {` is written instead of the correct syntax `if (!fs.existsSync(path))){`.

To fix this issue, we need to replace line 5 with the correct syntax. The corrected code is as follows:
```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = 'C:/parent/test';

try {
  if (!fs.existsSync(path))) {
    fs.mkdirsSync(path, { recursive: true }));
    console.log("Path successfully created");
  } else {
    console.log("Path already exists");
  }
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}
```
This code uses Node.js built-in fs module to create a directory and any missing parent directories specified in the `path` variable. If the directory does not exist, it will be created along with its necessary parents. The code also handles exceptions that may occur during the file system operation.
