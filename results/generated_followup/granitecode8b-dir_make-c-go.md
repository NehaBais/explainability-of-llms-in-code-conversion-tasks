The error is that the `path/filepath` package is imported but not used in the code. The `mkdirp` function takes a single path string as input and creates any missing directories in the path using the `os.MkdirAll` function from the Golang standard library. 
The fix is to import the `path/filepath` package and use its `Dir` function to get the directory name of the given path, and then call `mkdirp` with that directory name instead of the original path. This ensures that all intermediate directories are created as well.
Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main
import (
 "os"
 "path/filepath"
)
func mkdirp(path string) error {
 if err := os.MkdirAll(path, 0755); err != nil {
 return err
 }
 return nil
}
func main() {
 path := "./path/to/dir"
 dir := filepath.Dir(path)
 if err := mkdirp(dir); err != nil {
 panic(err)
 }
}
```
