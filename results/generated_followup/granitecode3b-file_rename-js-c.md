Error: expected "FILENAME" or <FILENAME>
Fix: enclose filename in double quotes
```c
#include 
int main() {
  _ @_;
  system("move \"input.txt\" \"output.txt\"");
  system("move \"c:/input.txt\" \"c:/output.txt\"");
  system("move docs mydocs");
  system("move \"c:/docs\" \"c:/mydocs\"");
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error message indicates that the compiler is expecting a filename or a filename surrounded by quotes, but instead receives an underscore. To fix this, we need to enclose the filenames in double quotes. Additionally, the undeclared function call for `system()` has been corrected by replacing it with the correct syntax.
