The error `Undefined symbols for architecture arm64` arises because symbols (_main, etc) are required for the program to run and link, but none of these symbols are defined in the provided Golang function. 

To fix this, you need to define these symbols or at least make them available (linking) in your C code. Here's how to do it:

1. Add the `main` function.
2. In your Golang function, remove the symbols that are not part of C program's life cycle: `fmt.Println`, `main` etc.
3. Compiling and running the corrected code should no longer generate the error `Undefined symbols for architecture arm64`.
