The error `main` function not found in crate `yicoder9b_dir_make_c_rs` occurs because we are trying to compile a Rust file that does not have the `main` function defined. The `main` function is the entry point of any Rust application and it's necessary for running the code.

The fix would be adding the main function where your current code ends:

```rs
use std::{error::Error, fs};

pub fn make_directory(path: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    fs::create_dir_all(path)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    let path = "./path/to/dir"; // Replace this with your directory
    match make_directory(path) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Directory created successfully: {}", path),
        Err(error) => eprintln!("Failed to create directory: {} - Error: {:?}", path, error),
    }
}
```
In the updated code block above, `main` function is added. This function calls our `make_directory()` function with a specific path and matches its result. If everything goes well (`Ok(_)`), it prints success message otherwise, if there's an error (`Err(error)`), it prints that error which helps to diagnose the problem.
