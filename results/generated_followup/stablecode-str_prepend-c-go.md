Error: The error occurred because there is an extra closing parenthesis `)` at the end of the statement in the Go code. This causes a syntax error.
Fix: To fix this error, remove the extra closing parenthesis `)` at the end of the statement.
Go Code:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	str := "my String"
	cstr := "Changed "
	dup := strings.Repeat(cstr, 1) + str

	fmt.Println(strings.TrimSpace(dup))))
}
```
