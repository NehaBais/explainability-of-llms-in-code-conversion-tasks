The error message is indicating that the "path/filepath" package was imported but not used in the program. This is because the function defined in the "mkdirp" function does not use any functions or variables from the "path/filepath" package. To fix this issue, you can remove the import statement for the "path/filepath" package since it is not needed in this case.

Here is the corrected code:
```go
package main

import (
	"os"
)

func mkdirp(path string) error {
	if err := os.MkdirAll(path, os.ModePerm); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}
```
