The error in the Python code is that it uses the `+` operator to concatenate strings, which is not idiomatic in Java. In Java, it is recommended to use the `concat()` method or the `StringBuilder` class to concatenate strings.
The fix for this error is to replace the `+=` operator with the `concat()` method or the `StringBuilder` class.
The corrected code in a single code block:
```java
String str = "12345678";
str = str.concat("9!");
System.out.println(str);
``` 
This code concatenates the string variable `str` with the string literal `"9!"` using the `concat()` method, and then prints the contents of the string variable.
