The error occurs because there is no main function in the given code. This means that the program needs to have its own entry point, otherwise it won't be able to run. To fix this issue, add a `main` function with an empty body.

This `main` function will act as the entry point for your program and allows it to be executed. The return value of this function, `0`, is conventionally used as a successful exit status. 

Now, you can compile and run the code without any errors. Here's the updated C++ code that includes the main function:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
void logic(bool a, bool b) {
    std::cout << "a AND b:  " << (a && b) << '\n';
    std::cout << "a OR b:   " << (a || b) << '\n';
    std::cout << "NOT a:    " << (!a) << '\n';
}
int main() {
    // Example usage of the function
    logic(true, false);  // Output: a AND b: true; a OR b: true; NOT a: false
    return 0;
}
```
