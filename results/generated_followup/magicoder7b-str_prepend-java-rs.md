 The error message "expected item, found keyword `let`" is referring to the fact that Rust requires specific items (like functions, structs, enums etc.) to be declared in a module which is not done correctly in this case. This issue arises because you're declaring variables and methods within backticks (`), but Rust expects them to be part of some sort of data structure or function definition.

The fix involves ensuring that the code block containing the variable declaration and assignment is inside a function, so it can actually be executed. Here's the corrected code:

```rs
fn main() {
    let mut string = String::from("def"); // Create a string variable equal to any text value
    string = format!("abc{}", string); // Prepend the string variable with another string literal.
}
```
In this revised code, `main()` is a function that contains our variables and assignment operations. Without this function, Rust will not know where to look for these items of code, leading to the error message.
