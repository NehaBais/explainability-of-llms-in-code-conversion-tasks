Error: The `main` function is not found in the crate `granitecode3b_logic_ops_cpp_rs`.
Fix: Add a `main` function to the code.
Corrected Code:
```rust
fn main() {
    fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
        println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
        println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
        println!("not a is {}", !a);
    }
    print_logic(true, false);
}
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the `main` function was not defined in the crate. To fix this, we added a `main` function to the code and called it with sample arguments. The corrected code also includes type annotations for the function parameters.
