The error occurs because C does not have an unsigned integer type as Java. The `unsigned int` type is part of the C language specification, but it is not implemented in many modern compilers or environments where C is used. Therefore, the compiler treats this line as invalid syntax. 

In a C context, you would need to cast the signed integer into an unsigned integer, which means that you would need to replace `unsigned int c = a;` with `unsigned int *p = &a;` (this will cause the variable 'a' to be treated as if it were an array of bytes) and then use the dereferenced value. Here is how you could correct the code in Java:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        bitwise(5, 3); //Test the function with a and b as 5 and 3 respectively.
    }
    static void bitwise(int a, int b) {
        //Performing bitwise AND on two integers 'a' and 'b'.
        System.out.println("a & b: " + (a & b));
        //Performing bitwise OR on two integers 'a' and 'b'.
        System.out.println("a | b: " + (a | b));
        //Performing bitwise XOR on two integers 'a' and 'b'.
        System.out.println("a ^ b: " + (a ^ b));
        //Performing NOT on integer 'a'.
        System.out.println("~a: " + ~a);
        //Performing left shift on integer 'a' with 'b' shifts to the left.
        System.out.println("a << b: " + (a << b)); 
        // Performing right shift on integer 'a' with 'b' shifts to the right.
        System.out.println("a >> b: " + (a >> b));
        // we perform a logical right shift on it with 'b' shifts to the right and print the result
        System.out.println("c >> b: " + (Integer.toUnsignedString((int) ((long) a >> b))));
    }
}
```
