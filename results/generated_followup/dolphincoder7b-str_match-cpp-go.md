The error message is "undefined: loc". This means that Go is looking for a variable named `loc` somewhere in the program, but it's not found anywhere in the code. The fix to this error is to declare `loc` as an integer variable before its first use in the function, and initialize it to 0.

Here's the corrected code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "strings"

func main() {
    s1 := "abcd"
    s2 := "abab"
    s3 := "ab"

    // Beginning
    if strings.HasPrefix(s1, s3) {
        fmt.Println("True: first string starts with second string")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("False: first string does not start with second string")
    }

    // Ending
    if strings.HasSuffix(s1, s3) {
        fmt.Println("True: first string ends with second string")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("False: first string does not end with second string")
    }

    // Anywhere
    loc := 0
    for i  := 1; ; i++  {
        loc = strings.Index(s2, s3)
        if loc == -1 {
            break
        }

        fmt.Printf("True: second string is found at index %d\n", loc)
        s2 = s2[loc+len(s3):]
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, `loc` is declared as an integer variable and initialized to 0 before it's used in the loop. This ensures that it can be successfully assigned a value during the subsequent iterations of the loop.
