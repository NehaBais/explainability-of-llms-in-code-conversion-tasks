The error occurs because Golang requires that file paths be passed to `os.File()` as string literals, rather than as untyped constants. This is because Golang does not have a built-in "File" type but instead uses the `io/ioutil` package for reading and writing files. 

The fix involves changing the code to use string literals instead of untyped string constants in `os.File()`. The corrected code would look like this:

```go
package main

import  "fmt"
import  "os"

func main()  {
    fileA := os.File("file.txt")
    size, _ := fileA.Stat()
    fmt.Printf("%,d B%n", size.Size()) // print out the size in bytes
}
```

This will allow Golang to compile and execute the code successfully. The `os` package provides access to operating system functionality, including working with files and directories.
