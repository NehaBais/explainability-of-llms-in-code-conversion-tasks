The error message indicates that the `var` keyword is expected, but was found instead. To fix this, simply remove the `var` keyword and declare the string variable `s` as follows:
```go
s := "World"
s = "Hello " + s
fmt.Println(s)
```
This code block should compile without errors and print the output `"Hello World"` to the console.
