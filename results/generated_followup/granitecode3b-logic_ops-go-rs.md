Error: The `main` function is not found in the crate. To fix this, add a `main` function to the file and ensure it returns an integer (0 for success).
```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
    print_logic(true, false);
    Ok(())
}

fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the `main` function was not found in the crate. In Rust, the entry point of a program is defined by the `main` function, which should return an integer (0 for success). In this case, the code compiled successfully without any errors, but when run, it produced an "invalid binary" error because the `main` function was not found in the crate.
To fix this, add a `main` function to the file and ensure it returns an integer (0 for success). The `main` function is responsible for executing the program and handling any errors that may occur. In this case, the `main` function calls the `print_logic` function with the arguments `true` and `false`, which prints the results of the logical operations to the console.
