The error message indicates that there are some unrecognized characters being used as identifiers, which is not allowed in C programming language. Specifically, these special characters include '|', '｜' (a Unicode character), '▁'. 

The fix would be to remove or replace these with valid characters. For instance, the line `return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜> kip this line !;` can be replaced by `return 0;` which is a valid return statement in C.

Here's how you could write the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void find_all(const char *str, const char *sub) {
  char *ptr = strstr(str, sub);
  
  if (ptr != NULL) {
    printf("Found at index %ld\n", ptr - str);
    ++ptr;
    while ((ptr = strstr(ptr, sub)) != NULL) {
      printf("Found at index %ld\n", ptr - str);
      ++ptr;
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  const char *stringA = "sip this line!";
  
  if (strncmp(stringA, "skip", strlen("skip")) == 0)
    printf("Match found\n");
  
  find_all(stringA, "line");
  
  if (strcmp(stringA + strlen(stringA) - 5, "sentence") == 0)
    printf("End of sentence found\n");
    
  return 0;
}
```
This code is now syntactically correct and should run without errors on any system where the C99 standard is supported. The function `find_all` has been modified to increment `ptr` after each call to `strstr`, ensuring it moves to the next character in each subsequent search. In the main function, string comparisons have also been updated with appropriate strlen and strcmp calls for proper comparison of strings.
