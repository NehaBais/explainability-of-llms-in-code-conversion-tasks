The error was caused by the fact that the `main` function was named with a capital letter, which is a reserved word in JavaScript. To fix this, I changed the name of the function to `main` without a capital letter.
Here's the corrected code:
```js
function main() {
    let s = "ABCDEFGH";
    let n = 2, m = 3;
    // for reference
    console.log("Index:", "01234567");
    console.log("String:", s);
    // starting from n characters in and of m length
    console.log(`Start ${n}, length ${m}:    ` + s.slice(n, n+m));
    // starting from n characters in, up to the end of the string
    console.log(`Start ${n}, to end:      ` + s.slice(n));
    // whole string minus last character
    console.log(`All but last:         ` + s.slice(0, -1));
    // starting from a known character within the string and of m length
    let dx = s.indexOf("D");
    console.log(`Start 'D', length ${m}:  ` + s.slice(dx, dx+m));
    // starting from a known substring within the string and of m length
    let sx = s.indexOf("DE");
    console.log(`Start "DE", length ${m}: ${s.slice(sx, sx+m)}`);
}
main();
```
