The error is because `strings.Join` requires an array of strings as its first argument, but `"0"` is a string constant. The fix is to use the `[]string{"0", s}` syntax to create an array with two elements: the string literal "0" and the variable `s`.

Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	s := "12345678"
	s = strings.Join([]string{"0", s}, "") // By concatenation
	fmt.Println(s)
}
```
