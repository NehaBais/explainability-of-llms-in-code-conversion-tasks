The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the `` and `` headers, which are required to use the `std::string` type and the `std::cout` function in C++. To fix this, we need to include these headers at the beginning of the program.
Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include
#include
int main() {
  std::string s = "hello";
  std::cout << s << std::endl;
  std::cout << s + " literal" << std::endl;
  std::string s2 = s + " literal";
  std::cout << s2 << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Note that we need to include the `` and `` headers at the beginning of the program, as well as the `std::` prefix before the `string` and `cout` types and functions.
