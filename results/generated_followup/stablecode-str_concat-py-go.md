The error in this code is that there's an unexpected `}` in the argument list, possibly due to forgetting to add a comma between arguments or closing a parenthesis before adding another argument.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure proper formatting of function calls and argument lists:
- Open a pair of parentheses before calling a function or performing any operation that requires parentheses around its parameters.
- Inside the parameter list, separate each individual argument with a comma.
- Close the parentheses after you've finished specifying all the arguments for your function call.

Here's how you can rewrite this code block in a single fenced code block:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

func main() {

    // Create a string variable equal to any text value.
    s1 := "hello"

    // Print s2 which is concatenation of s1 and " world".
    s2 := s1 + " world"
    fmt.Println(s2)

    // Concatenate strings in slice and assign to variable s2.
    s1 = ", " + strings.Join([]string{s1, "world", "mom"}}, ",")
    fmt.Println(s1)

    // Print the content of the variables.
    fmt.Printf("s1: %s\n", s1))
    fmt.Printf("s2: %s\n", s2))
}
```
