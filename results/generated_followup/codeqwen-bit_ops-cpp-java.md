The error message states that "cannot find symbol" for the variables `B` which are not defined anywhere.

To fix this error, replace all occurrences of `B` with `b`. 

Here is the corrected Java version of your C++ code:

```java
public class Main {
  void bitwise(int A, int b) {
    System.out.println(
        "A and b: "
            + (A & b)); // Note: parentheses are needed because & has lower precedence than <<
    System.out.println("A or b:  " + (A | b));
    System.out.println("A xor b: " + (A ^ b));
    System.out.println("not A: " + ~A);

    // Note: The C/C++ shift operators are not guaranteed to work if the shift count (that is, b)
    // Is negative, or is greater or equal to the number of bits in the integer being shifted.
    System.out.println(
        "A shl b: " + (A << b)); // Note: "<<" is used both for output and for left shift
    System.out.println(
        "A shr b: " + (A >> b)); // typically arithmetic right shift, but not guaranteed
    int ua = A;
    System.out.println("A lsr b: " + (ua >>> b)); // logical right shift (guaranteed)

    // there are no rotation operators in Java, but as of Java 8 there is a standard-library rotate
    // function.
    // The rotate function works for all rotation amounts, but the integer being rotated must always
    // be an
    // unsigned integer.
    System.out.println("A rol b: " + Integer.rotateLeft(ua, b));
    System.out.println("A ror b: " + Integer.rotateRight(ua, b));
  }
}
```
