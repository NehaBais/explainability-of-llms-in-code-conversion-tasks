The error is generated due to incorrect usage of backticks while enclosing the C code. The expected expression or brace was not found which caused this error.

To fix this, we need to correctly enclose the entire C code within backticks (` `) instead of using multiple backticks (``).

Here is the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b;

    printf("Enter two integers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    int exponentiation = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) 
{
    exponentiation *= a;
}

    printf("%d ^ %d = %.0f\n", a, b, (float)exponentiation); // same sign as first operand
    return 0;
}
```
