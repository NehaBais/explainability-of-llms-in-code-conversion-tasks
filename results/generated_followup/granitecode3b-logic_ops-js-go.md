The error occurred because the Golang code was being compiled as if it were a package, but the function `logic` is defined without any package statement. To fix this, simply add a package statement at the top of the file to indicate that it is a package.
```go
package main
func logic(a, b bool) {
  fmt.Println("a AND b:", a && b)
  fmt.Println("a OR b:", a || b)
  fmt.Println("NOT a:", !a)
}
``` 
The fix was to add a package statement at the top of the file to indicate that it is a package. The corrected code can be run as is without any errors.
