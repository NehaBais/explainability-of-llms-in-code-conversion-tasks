The error in the Python code is that it contains an indentation issue. In Python, indentation is used to define blocks of code, and each block must be indented by the same amount. The line `i = i.start()` is not indented correctly, which causes a syntax error when the code is executed.
The fix for this issue is to add the appropriate number of spaces or tabs before the line `i = i.start()`. Once this is done, the code will execute without any errors.
Here is the corrected Python code:
```py
import re
def match(first, second):
 print("1. {} starts with {}: {}".format(first, second, first.startswith(second)))
 i = re.search(second, first)
 if i is not None:
 i = i.start()
 print("2. {} contains {}: True".format(first, second))
 print("2.1. at location {}".format(i))
 for m in re.finditer(second, first):
 i = m.start()
 print("2.2. at location {}".format(i))
 if i == len(first) - len(second):
 break
 else:
 print("2.2. and that's all")
 print("3. {} ends with {}: {}".format(first, second, first.endswith(second)))
```
This code will now execute without any errors and will correctly match the three types of string matching as specified in the requirement.
