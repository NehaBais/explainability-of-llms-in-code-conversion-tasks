The error messages indicate that the code is using unstable features or libraries that are not yet stabilized, which may cause compatibility issues with future versions of Rust. The suggested fixes are to update the crate versions or use stable alternatives.
Here's a corrected version of the code that uses the standard library and does not require any unstable features:
```rust
use std::fs;
fn main() {
    fs::create_dir_all("./path/to/dir").expect(" unable to create directory");
}
```
The `std::fs` module provides a more stable and modern way to create directories and handle errors. The `create_dir_all` function creates all the necessary directories in the given path, including any missing parents. The `.expect` method is used to handle any potential errors that may occur during the creation process.
