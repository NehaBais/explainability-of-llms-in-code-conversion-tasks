The error occurred because the C++ compiler cannot find the `cout` and `endl` functions, which are defined in the `iostream` library. To fix this error, you need to include the `iostream` header file at the beginning of your C++ program by adding `#include`. 
Here's the fixed code:
```cpp
#include
using namespace std;
int main() {
  bool a = true;
  bool b = true;
  cout << a << " and " << b << " -> " << (a && b) << endl;
  cout << a << " or " << b << " -> " << (a || b) << endl;
  cout << a << " xor " << b << " -> " << (a ^ b) << endl;
  cout << "! " << a << " -> " << (!a) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This code defines the `boolean_ops` function that takes two boolean values, and outputs the result of "and", "or", and "not" on both arguments. The main function calls this function with different argument combinations to test the output.
Note: If you are using CMake or a build system, make sure to link against the `iostream` library by adding `-lstdc++` to your linker flags.
