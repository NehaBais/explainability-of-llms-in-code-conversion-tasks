The error `/tmp/yicoder2b-file_exists-java-go.go:1:1: expected 'package', found 'import'` is caused by trying to import a package (in this case Golang standard library) after defining the main function or before defining any function and variable in Go.

The fix for this would be to ensure that all functions are defined before they are called or imported. Hence it should look like this:

```go
package main

import "os"

func main() {
    if file, err := os.Open("docs/input.txt"); err == nil { 
        // Handle the file if it exists
    } else if err == nil && err.Error() == "" {
        // Handle empty error as file not found
    } else {
        println(err) // Print error or handle it based on your requirements
    }
    if file, err := os.Open("/docs/input.txt"); err == nil { 
        // Handle the file if it exists in root filesystem
    } else if err == nil && err.Error() == "" {
        // Handle empty error as file not found in root filesystem
    } else {
        println(err) // Print error or handle it based on your requirements
    }
}
```
This would ensure that the functions are defined before being called, thus avoiding the error.
