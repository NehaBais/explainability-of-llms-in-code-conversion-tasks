The error message indicates that there are syntax errors, possibly related to incorrect characters or missing braces (`{}`). The character `｜begin▁of▁sentence｜` is not recognized in the context of C language and seems to be a placeholder for commented out code. 

The fix would involve removing this unrecognized code and ensuring correct syntax such as matching braces (`{}`) and providing an actual expression or statement after `return`, if needed.

Here is how you can write the corrected C code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void bitwise(int a, int b)  {
   if  (b < 0)  {
      printf("Error: Shift amount must not be negative\n");
      return;
    }
    printf("%d %% %d = %d \n", a, b, a % b); // Print remainder of division
    printf("%d / %d = %f \n", a, b,(float)a/(float)b );  // print float value of the division of two numbers.
}
int main() {
   bitwise(10,3);
   return 0; 
}
```
This code will calculate and display the remainder when `a` is divided by `b` (using `%`) as well as print the result of division of `a` by `b`. It also checks if the shift amount is negative and prints an error message in such case. The main function calls bitwise with two integer parameters, which then performs a modulus operation (remainder after integer division), followed by an integer division. This all takes place within the context of a C program that includes the standard input/output library for printf functionality.
