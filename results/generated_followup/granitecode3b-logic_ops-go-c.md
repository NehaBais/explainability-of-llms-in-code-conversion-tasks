The error occurred because the `printf` function is not declared in the standard library, so the compiler cannot find its implementation. To fix this, we need to include the header file `<stdio.h>` or explicitly provide a declaration for `printf`.
Here's how we can rewrite the corrected code in a single fenced code block:
```c
#include 
int main() {
  int a = 1; // set to 1 or 0 for true or false respectively
  int b = 1;
  printf("a and b is %d", a && b);
  printf("n");
  printf("a or b is %d", a || b);
  printf("n");
  printf("not a is %d", !a);
  return 0;
}
```
This code should compile without any errors.
