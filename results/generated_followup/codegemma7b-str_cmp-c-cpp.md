**Error:** The `string::insensitive` option is not available in C++ versions prior to C++11.

**Fix:** Replace `string::insensitive` with `std::ignore` to indicate that case sensitivity should be ignored.

**Corrected Code:**

```cpp
a = "ball";
b = "BALL";
cout << "a == b (case insensitive): "
     << (a.compare(b, std::ignore) == 0) << endl;
```
