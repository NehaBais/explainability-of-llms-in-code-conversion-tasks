The error occurs because there are multiple definitions of the `substring` function with different parameter types. In Rust, it is not allowed to redefine functions with the same name unless they have the exact same signature. The compiler is unable to determine which definition is intended and results in an error. To fix this issue, the `substring` function should be defined only once in the file or one of them should be removed.

The corrected code would be as follows:
```rust
fn substring(str: &str) -> String {
    // ...
}
```

Please note that the fixed code block is not executable and contains placeholders for the actual implementation of the `substring` function. It only includes the structure of the function definition and its return type.
