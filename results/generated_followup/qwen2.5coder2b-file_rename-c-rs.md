The error is because the crate name cannot contain a dot ('.'). When renaming files, Rust expects the crate to have a valid name, which doesn't include dots. The fix is to remove the dot from the crate name.

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Rename in current directory
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs");

    // Rename in root directory
    fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
}
```

This should compile without errors.
