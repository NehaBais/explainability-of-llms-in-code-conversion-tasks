The error occurs because Rust requires all format arguments to be string literals, rather than just a single value provided as a string literal. To resolve this issue, we need to add an additional string literal for `str` in the `format!` macro call:

```rs
let out = format!("{} {}", str, txt);
```

This will allow the code to compile without errors and produce the expected output. The fix involves formatting a single value as a string literal within the format argument of the `format!` macro, ensuring that both values are treated as strings for proper interpolation.
