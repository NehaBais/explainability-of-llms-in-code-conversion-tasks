The error is that there is an unknown type name 'GET'. The program does not know what 'GET' is, so it cannot proceed with the compilation. To fix this issue, we need to understand how the code works.

In Golang, the syntax for getting input from user using fmt.Scan(&n1) and fmt.Scan(&n2). However, there's no direct equivalent in C as these functions are part of fmt package. 

To solve this problem, we can use the scanf function which is equivalent to the above functions in Golang. The format specifier %d is used to read integers from the user input. Here's how the corrected code looks like:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n1, n2;

    printf("Enter two numbers: \n");
    scanf("%d%d", &n1, &n2);

    if (n1 < n2) {
        printf("%d is less than %d.\n", n1, n2);
    } else if (n1 == n2) {
        printf("%d is equal to %d.\n", n1, n2);
    } else {
        printf("%d is greater than %d.\n", n1, n2);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we use scanf function with format specifier %d to read two integers. The if-else statements are used to check whether the first integer is less than, equal to or greater than the second integer. The printf function is then used to display a message based on the condition met.
