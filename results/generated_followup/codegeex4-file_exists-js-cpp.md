The error occurs because the `std::filesystem` library is not included by default in some environments, causing it to be undefined.

To resolve this, include the `<filesystem>` header at the top of your program.

Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <filesystem>

void checkExists(const std::string &path, const std::string &fileName,
                 const std::string &folderName) {
  std::ifstream file(path + "/" + fileName);
  std::filesystem::path dir(path + "/" + folderName);

  if (file.good()) {
    std::cout << "File: " << fileName << " exists in directory: " << path
              << "\n";
  } else {
    std::cout << "File: " << fileName
              << " does not exist in directory: " << path << "\n";
  }

  if (std::filesystem::exists(dir)) {
    std::cout << "Folder: " << folderName << " exists in directory: " << path
              << "\n";
  } else {
    std::cout << "Folder: " << folderName
              << " does not exist in directory: " << path << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  const std::string currentDirectory = ".";
  const std::string rootDirectory = "/";
  const std::string fileName = "input.txt";
  const std::string folderName = "docs";

  checkExists(currentDirectory, fileName, folderName);
  checkExists(rootDirectory, fileName, folderName);

  return 0;
}
```
