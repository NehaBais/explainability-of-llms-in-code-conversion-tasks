The error is due to an unterminated string literal. The `!!!` at the end of the second append operation is not properly closed, causing the syntax error.

The fix is to close the string literal with a double quote (`"`).

Here is the corrected code in a single code block:

```py
# Create a string variable equal to any text value.
text = "Good Morning"

# Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way.
text += " to all"
text += " !!!"

# Show the contents of the variable after the append operation.
print(text)
```
This corrected code will now run without syntax errors and will output: `Good Morning to all!!!`
