The error is caused by an unmatched closing parenthesis `)` at line 13 of the code snippet. The fix for this issue requires adding another opening parenthesis at line 12 before the `raise` statement:
```python
    if s > t:
        print(f"'{s}' is bytewise greater than '{t}'")
    elif s < t:
        print(f"'{s}' is bytewise less than '{t}'"))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Strings cannot be equal if they are not treated lexically"))
```
This code block fixes the syntax error by adding an extra opening parenthesis at line 12 before the `raise` statement. This change ensures that the syntax of the code is correct and can be executed without any errors or warnings.
