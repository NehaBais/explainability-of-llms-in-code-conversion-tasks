The error can be explained as "can't find crate" since there is no such Rust crate named `rust` available for use, while the import of `std::io::Error` is not being used anywhere in the provided snippet which would result in a warning.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the line `extern crate rust;` and the unused import at the top of our code block because they are causing errors. The corrected Rust code should be:

```rs
use std::fs;

fn print_file_size(f: &str)  {
    match fs::metadata(f) {
        Ok(stat) => println!("{}", stat.len()),
        Err(error) => eprintln!("{}", error),
    }
}

fn main()  {
    print_file_size("input.txt");
    // Replace the following path with the appropriate one for your system.
    print_file_size("/path/to/your/root/directory/input.txt");
}
```
This code does not import any external crate and uses `std::fs` which includes the functionality required to get file metadata in Rust. The function `print_file_size(f: &str)` is used to print out the size of a file specified by its name or path, while `main()` calls this function with both "input.txt" and "/path/to/your/root/directory/input.txt".
