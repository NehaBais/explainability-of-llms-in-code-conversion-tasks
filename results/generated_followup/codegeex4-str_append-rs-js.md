The error occurs because the identifier `hello` has already been declared earlier. To fix this, we can use different variable names for each case or use the let keyword with the same name again to allow re-declaration.

Here's the corrected JavaScript code:

```js
let hello = "Hello World";
hello += "!!!!!";

console.log(hello);

// Or

let hello = "Hello World";
hello.concat("!!!!!");

console.log(hello);
```
