The error is caused by the fact that the Rust keyword `let` cannot be used to declare a mutable string variable without specifying its type. The fix is to specify that `s1` is of type `String`.

The corrected code is:
```rs
fn main() {
 let mut s1 = String::from("Hello");
 s1.push_str(", World!");
 println!("{}", s1);
}
```
This code creates a mutable string variable called `s1`, initializes it with the value `"Hello"`, appends the string literal ", World!" to the end of `s1` using the `push_str` method, and then prints the contents of `s1` using the `println!` macro.
