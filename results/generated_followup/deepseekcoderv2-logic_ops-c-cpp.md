 The error is due to missing `main` function in the C++ code, which is required for executable programs.
The fix is adding a `main` function.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void print_logic(bool a, bool b) {
  std::cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "not a is " << (!a) << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    print_logic(true, true);
    return 0;
}
```
