The error in this case is: 

This error is occurring because the variable `adjective` is being defined incorrectly. 

To fix this issue, we need to remove the tilde (`~`) before the string literal `"little"`. The correct way to define a string variable in Rust is by enclosing the string value in double quotes (`""`)).

Here's the corrected code:

```rust
let adjective = "little";
let lyrics = format!("Mary had a {} lamb", adjective);
println!("{}", lyrics);
```
This code correctly defines the `adjective` variable as `"little"` and interpolates this value into the given format string to create the `lyrics` variable. Finally, it prints out the interpolated string to the console.
