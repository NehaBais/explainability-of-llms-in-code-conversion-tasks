Here is how to solve the problem:

1. Explain error in a single line. The error found was "mismatched types".
2. Explanations of the fix. We need to return a boolean value from our function `string_compare()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression.
3. Rewrite the corrected code: ```fn string_compare() -> bool { str1.len() == str2.len() }``` This code will return true if both strings have same length and false otherwise.
4. Use fenced code block to write the entire code. Here is the complete code:

```rust
fn string_compare(str1: &String, str2: &String) -> bool {
    str1.len() == str2.len()
}
```
In this function, we pass two strings (immutables are passed by value and mutable is passed by reference to avoid potential issues), the function will return true if both strings have same length and false otherwise.
