The error message is "fatal error: 'windows.h' file not found". This means that the compiler can't find the header file `windows.h`. It seems like there might be a problem with the path to this file or the environment variables, but the specific cause isn't apparent without more information about the compilation process and the system setup.

To fix the error, we need to include the Windows SDK's `windows.h` file by adding `#include <windows.h>` at the top of the code.

Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include  <stdio.h>
#include  <windows.h>
#define MAX_PATH 260

int main() {
  char from[MAX_PATH], to[MAX_PATH];

  /* Rename a file */
  strcpy(from, "input.txt");
  strcpy(to, "output.txt");
  MoveFile(from, to);

   /* Rename a file in another drive  */
  strcpy(from, "c:\\input.txt");
  strcpy(to, "c:\\output.txt");
  MoveFile(from, to);

   /* Rename a directory */
  GetFullPathName("docs", MAX_PATH, from, NULL);
  GetFullPathName("mydocs", MAX_PATH, to, NULL);
  if  (MoveFileEx(from, to, MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING) == 0) {
    printf("Unable to rename directory.\n");
    return -1;
   }

   /* Rename a directory in another drive  */
  GetFullPathName("c:\\docs", MAX_PATH, from, NULL);
  GetFullPathName("c:\\mydocs", MAX_PATH, to, NULL);
  if  (MoveFileEx(from, to, MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING) == 0) {
    printf("Unable to rename directory.\n");
    return -1;
   }

  return 0;
}
```
