The error occurred because the `math` and `sort` packages are not imported in the Golang code. The `math` package contains mathematical functions such as square root, and the `sort` package is used to sort slices of integers. To fix this error, we need to import these two packages at the top of the file.
Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main
import (
 "fmt"
 "math"
 "sort"
)
func factor(num int) []int {
 var factors []int
 for i := 1; i <= int(math.Sqrt(float64(num))); i++ {
 if num%i == 0 {
 factors = append(factors, i)
 factors = append(factors, num/i)
 }
 }
 sort.Ints(factors)
 return factors
}
func main() {
 fmt.Println(factor(100)) // [1 2 4 5 10 10 20 25 50 100]
 fmt.Println(factor(101)) // [1 101]
}
```
In this corrected code, the `math` and `sort` packages are imported at the top of the file using the `import` statement. This allows the program to access the necessary functions and types from these packages. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
