The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the file 'stdio.<'. This is likely because it has been misspelled, or it does not exist where expected. 

The fix to this problem would be to replace `#include <stdio.<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>` with `#include <stdio.h>`. The standard IO library in C programming language can be included using this header file.

Here is the corrected version of your code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() 
{
    char a[] = "abc";
    char b[] = "Bac";
    
    // Comparing two strings for exact equality
    if (strcmp(a, b) == 0)
        printf("The strings are equal\n");
        
    // Comparing two strings for inequality
    if (strcmp(a, b) != 0)
        printf("The strings are not equal\n");
    
    // Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other
    if (strcmp(a, b) < 0)
        printf("The first string is lexically before the second\n");
        
    // Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after than the other
    if (strcmp(a, b) > 0)
        printf("The first string is lexically after the second\n");
    
    // Case insensitive comparison
    char ac[] = "abc";
    char bc[] = "Bac";
        
    for (int i = 0; ac[i]; i++)
        ac[i] = toupper((unsigned char)ac[i]);
    
    for (int i = 0; bc[i]; i++)
        bc[i] = toupper((unsigned char)bc[i]);
        
    if (strcmp(ac, bc) == 0)
        printf("Both strings are equal when ignoring case\n");
    
    // Lexical comparison of numeric strings
    char num1[] = "123";
    char num2[] = "456";
        
    if (strcmp(num1, num2) < 0)
        printf("The first string is lexically before the second\n");
    
    if (strcmp(num1, num2) > 0)
        printf("The first string is lexically after the second\n");
        
    return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>0;
}
```
