Error: 
- The `#include` directive is used to include libraries or header files in C++. In this case, it is being used to include the `iostream` library which provides input/output operations. However, since the error message does not specify a file name, it is unable to identify the exact source of the error.
- The `using namespace std;` statement is also being used to bring all the names from the `std` namespace into the global scope. However, this should only be done if the code is going to use standard library functions or classes. In this case, it is not needed and can be safely removed.
Fix: 
- The error messages indicate that the compiler is unable to find the `iostream` library or any other required header files. To fix this, add the following line of code at the beginning of the program: `#include`.
- The error message also suggests that the program may be using undeclared identifiers. This can happen if there are variables or functions that were not declared in the scope where they are being used. To fix this, make sure to declare all required variables and functions before using them.
Rewritten Code:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;

  cout << "Enter value of a: ";
  cin >> a;

  cout << "Enter value of b: ";
  cin >> b;

  if (a < b) {
    cout << "a is less than b" << endl;
  } else if (a > b) {
    cout << "a is greater than b" << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "a is equal to b" << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
The error messages indicate that the compiler is unable to find certain header files, such as `iostream`, and may be using undeclared identifiers. To fix these errors, we added the necessary header file inclusions and declared all required variables and functions before using them.
