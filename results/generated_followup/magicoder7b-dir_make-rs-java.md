 The error in the code is because Java doesn't have built-in support for exceptions like Rust does (`expect` function). Hence, the IOException class needs to be imported from java.io package in order to use it. 

Fix: 
```java
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path path = Paths.get("./path/to/dir");
        Files.createDirectories(path);
    }
}
```
In this code, we import the necessary classes from `java.nio.file` and also `java.io`. Then in our main method, we call our previously defined function with a specific path and handle any potential IOException that might arise during directory creation using the throws keyword.
