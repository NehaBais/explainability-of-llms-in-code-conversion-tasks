The error is due to the fact that the first line of Golang code must be the package declaration, which includes the import statement for the "os" package. To fix this, we can simply add a package declaration at the top of the file.

```go
package main
import "os"
func mkdirp(path string) error {
 return os.MkdirAll(path, 0755)
}
```
This will compile without errors and create the directory and any missing parents as desired. The `main` package is used because it is a valid package name for a standalone executable program, but it does not contain any actual code that we need to run. We could have used any other package name instead of `main`, such as `mkdirp`.
