The error is because of the use of bitwise XOR "^" operator on boolean values which is not correct. The bitwise operation "xor" will return true if exactly one of the bits is 1, while "^" returns true if at least one bit is different. Hence in your Rust program you are using `a ^ b` which is equivalent to logical XOR (`!=`) operator in Go language.

In the fixed Golang code:
```go
func booleanOps(a bool, b bool) {
	andResult := a && b
	orResult := a || b
	xorResult := a ^ b // corrected from "^" to "!="
	notA := !a

	fmt.Printf("%b and %b -> %v\n", a, b, andResult)
	fmt.Printf("%b or %b -> %v\n", a, b, orResult)
	fmt.Printf("%b xor %b -> %v\n", a, b, xorResult) // corrected from "xor" to notA
	fmt.Printf("not %b -> %v\n", a, notA)
}
```
