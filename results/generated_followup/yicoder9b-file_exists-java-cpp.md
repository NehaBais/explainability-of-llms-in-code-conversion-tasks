The error message is indicating that it cannot find the 'boost/filesystem.hpp' header file, which comes from the Boost library in C++. This means that either the Boost library isn't installed on your system or its installation directory can't be found by the compiler.

To fix this problem you need to install the Boost library if it is not yet installed. Then link against the filesystem component during compilation (usually `-lboost_filesystem`).

Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>

int main() {
    namespace fs = boost::filesystem;

    // Path for current working directory and a file in 'docs' directory 
    fs::path p("docs/input.txt");
    if (fs::exists(p)) {
        std::cout << "File exists in the current directory\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "File does not exist in the current directory\n";
    }

    // Path for root directory and a file 'input.txt' in 'docs' sub-directory 
    fs::path p_root("/docs/input.txt");
    if (fs::exists(p_root)) {
        std::cout << "File exists at the root directory\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "File does not exist in the root directory\n";
    }
  return 0;
}
```
