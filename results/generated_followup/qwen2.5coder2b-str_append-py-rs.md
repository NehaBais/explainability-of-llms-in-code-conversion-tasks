The error message indicates that the crate name cannot contain a dot. In Rust, the crate name must be a valid identifier, which means it can only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens.

To fix this issue, you need to remove the dot from the crate name. You can do this by changing `'qwen2.5coder2b_str_append_py_rs'` to `"qwen2_5coder2b_str_append_py_rust"`.

Here is the corrected code in a single code block:

```rs
fn main() {
    let str = "12345678";
    let str = format!("{}{}", str, "9!");
    println!("{}", str);
}
```
