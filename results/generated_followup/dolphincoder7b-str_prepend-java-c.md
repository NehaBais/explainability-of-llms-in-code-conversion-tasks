The error occurs because C++ requires the `iostream` library for input/output operations, which is not included in the provided code. We need to include the necessary headers before we can use any standard output functions like `cout`.

To fix this issue, simply add `#include <iostream>` at the beginning of the file. This will import the necessary header files and make them accessible for our code.

Here's the corrected code:
```c++
#include <iostream>  // Import iostream library for input/output operations
using namespace std;
int main() {
   string str = "def";  // Initialize the string variable
   str = "abc" + str;  // Prepend the string with another string literal
   cout << "Result: " << str << endl;  // Output the result
   return 0;
}
```
