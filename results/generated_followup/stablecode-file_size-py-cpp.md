The error is caused by the fact that C++ does not support the same level of file system manipulation as Python, which includes features like creating directories or handling exceptions in a similar way to Python's `try-except` blocks.

To fix this issue, we can use the `<filesystem>` library introduced in C++17 to handle file system operations. However, it seems that this specific error is caused by not including the necessary header file that contains the definition for the `std::filesystem` namespace.

To resolve this issue and rewrite the corrected code in a single code block, you can include the following header file at the beginning of your C++ source code file.

This will ensure that the necessary definitions for the `std::filesystem` namespace are available to your program. Here is the complete corrected code in a single fenced code block:
```cpp
#include <filesystem>

int main() 
{ 
  // Current file path
  const std::string currentFilePath = "./input.txt";

  // Root file path (assumed to be the root directory of the filesystem))
  const std::string rootFilePath = "/input.txt";

  try 
  { 
    std::streamsize currentFileSize = std::filesystem::file_size(currentFilePath));
    std::cout << "Current File Size: " << currentFileSize << " bytes" << std::endl;

    std::streamsize rootFileSize = std::filesystem::file_size(rootFilePath));
    std::cout << "Root File Size: " << rootFileSize << " bytes" << std::endl;
  } 
  catch (const std::exception &e) 
  {
    std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
