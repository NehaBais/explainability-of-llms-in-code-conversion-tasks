The error message indicates that the `PathBuf` type is undeclared, which means it has not been imported or defined within the current scope. To fix this issue, you need to import the `std::path::PathBuf` type at the beginning of your code.

This will allow you to use the `PathBuf` type in your code and resolve the compilation error.

Here is the corrected code with the import added:

```rs
use std::fs;
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn main() {
    let path = PathBuf::from("./output.txt");
    fs::write(&path, &[]).unwrap();

    let path = PathBuf::from("/output.txt");
    fs::write(&path, &[]).unwrap();

    let path = PathBuf::from("./docs");
    fs::create_dir(&path).unwrap();

    let path = PathBuf::from("/docs");
    fs::create_dir(&path).unwrap();
}
```
