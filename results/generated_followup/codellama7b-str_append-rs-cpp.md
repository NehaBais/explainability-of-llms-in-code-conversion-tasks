The error is caused by the use of the `std` namespace, which is not declared in the C++ code. The fix is to include the necessary headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<string>`, to bring the `std::cout` and `std::string` functions into scope.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::string hello = "Hello World";
  std::cout << (hello + "!!!!") << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This code should now compile and run successfully.
