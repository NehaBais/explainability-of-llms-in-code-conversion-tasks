The error in this code is that there is an unmatched ")" at the end of the print statement.

To fix this error, we need to add a closing parenthesis ")" after "print". 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def logic(a,b): 
    print("a AND b: ", (a and b))))
    print("a OR b: ", (a or b))))
    print("NOT a: ", (!(a)))))
```

In this corrected code, we have added the closing parenthesis ")" after each print statement. This ensures that all parentheses are matched correctly in the code.
