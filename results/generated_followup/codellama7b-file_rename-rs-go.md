The error message is indicating that the `io/ioutil` package is imported but not used in the code. This is an issue because Go requires that all packages be used in some way in order to avoid unnecessary overhead. In this case, the `ioutil` package is being imported but it is not being used anywhere in the code.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the import statement for `io/ioutil`. Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	//Rename a file called input.txt into output.txt and
	//a directory called docs into mydocs.
	err := os.Rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
	err = os.Rename("docs", "mydocs")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
}
```
This code removes the import statement for `io/ioutil` and uses the `os` package instead, which is sufficient for renaming files and directories in Go.
