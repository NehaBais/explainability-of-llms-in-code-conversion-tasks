The error indicates that the `main` function, which is necessary for Go programs to start execution, is missing from the main package. In Go, every executable program requires a `main` function.

To fix this, we need to define a `main` function that calls our `printLogic` function with appropriate boolean arguments. Here's the corrected code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func printLogic(a bool, b bool) {
	fmt.Println("a and b is", a && b)
	fmt.Println("a or b is", a || b)
	fmt.Println("not a is", !a)
}

func main() {
	printLogic(true, true)
}
```

In this corrected code block, the `main` function calls `printLogic` with boolean arguments `true` and `true`, which are then passed to the logical operations in `printLogic`.
