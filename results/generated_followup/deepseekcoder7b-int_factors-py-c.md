The error message indicates that there are some undeclared identifiers, operators or syntax errors in the C code which is causing compilation issues. In this case, '｜begin▁of▁sentence｜' seems to be an unusual symbol and it appears multiple times without being properly formed as a valid statement.

The fix would be to remove those erroneous symbols from the code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void factor(int n)  {
    int factors1[n], factors2[n];
    int x;
    for (x = 1; x * x <= n; ++x) {
        if (n % x == 0) {
            factors1[x - 1] = x;
            factors2[(n / x) - 1] = n / x;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < x - 1; ++i) {
        printf("%d ", factors1[i]);
    }
  
    if (x * x == n) {
        printf("%d ", x); // This is to handle perfect squares. The loop won't execute for them as the condition in for loop is `<=` and n must be less than square of any integer hence we handle it separately.
    }
  
    for (int i = (x - 2); i >= 0; --i) { // -1 to offset zero index
        printf("%d ", factors2[i]);
    }
}

int main() {
    int numbers[] = {45, 53, 64};
  
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        printf("%d: factors: ", numbers[i]);
        factor(numbers[i]);
        printf("\n");
    }
  
    return 0;
}
```
This code snippet now should compile without any error. It calculates and prints the factors of a positive integer in C language.
