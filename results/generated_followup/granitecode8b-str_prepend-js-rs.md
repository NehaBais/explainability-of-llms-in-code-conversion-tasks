The error is caused by the `let` keyword being used outside of its intended context, which is to declare a new variable or constant in Rust. The `prepend()` method is a method of the `String` type, but it cannot be called on a variable that has not been declared using the `mut` keyword.
The fix is to remove the `let` keyword and use the `String::from()` function to create a new `String` instance with the value ", World". Then, we can call the `prepend()` method on the `s` variable to add "Hello " to the beginning of the string. Finally, we print the resulting string using `println!()`.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
let mut s = String::from(", World");
s.prepend("Hello ");
println!("{}", s);
```
This code creates a new `String` instance with the value ", World", stores it in a mutable variable called `s`, calls the `prepend()` method to add "Hello " to the beginning of the string, and then prints the resulting string using `println!()`.
