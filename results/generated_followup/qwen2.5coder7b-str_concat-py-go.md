**Error Explanation:** The error occurs because Go does not have a built-in `join` method for strings like Python. The `.join()` method is used on string types to concatenate elements of a slice into a single string, which is not available in the language.

**Fix Explanation:** To join elements of a slice of strings in Go, you can use a loop to manually concatenate them with the desired separator.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	s1 := "hello"
	fmt.Println(s1 + " world")

	s2 := s1 + " world"
	fmt.Println(s2)

	// Manually join multiple strings with ", "
	s3 := ""
	for i, str := range []string{s1, "world", "mom"} {
		if i != 0 {
			s3 += ", "
		}
		s3 += str
	}

	fmt.Println(s3)
}
```
