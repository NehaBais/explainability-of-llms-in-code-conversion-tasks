The error "undefined: os.ChDir" occurs because there is no function called `os.ChDir` in the Go standard library. However, we can fix this by importing the `os` package and using its `Chdir` method to change the working directory.

The correct code would be:
```go
package main

import  (
	 "os"
)

func main() {
	err  := os.Chdir("/home/user")  // Change the current working directory to "/home/user"
	if err  != nil  {
		panic(err)
	}

	fd, err  := os.OpenFile("output.txt", os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE|os.O_TRUNC, 0640)  // Create a new file with permissions rw-r----- and truncate its contents to zero bytes
	if err  != nil  {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer fd.Close()

	err = os.Mkdir("docs", 0750)  // Create an empty directory with permissions rwxr-x---
	if err  != nil  {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

The error occurred because the `os` package does not contain a function called `ChDir`. However, by importing this package and using its `Chdir` method instead, we can fix this issue.
