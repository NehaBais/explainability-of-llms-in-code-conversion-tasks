Error: `E076` (unterminated double quote string) - This error occurred because Rust's string literals must be terminated by a double quote (`"`), but in this case, there was a missing closing double quote (`"`))
Fix: Add a closing double quote (`""`) after the string literal.
Corrected code:
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut s1 = "Hello".to_string();
    s1.push_str(", World!");");
    println!("{}", s1);
}
```
In this corrected code, I added a closing double quote (`""`) after the string literal `"Hello"` in order to fix the error.
