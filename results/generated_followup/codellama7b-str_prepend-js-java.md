Error: The compiler is not able to find the `System` class in Java, which is required for the `println()` method.
Fix: Add the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling the code to enable implicitly declared classes.
Corrected Code:
```java
String s = ", World";
s = "Hello" + s;
System.out.println(s);
```
