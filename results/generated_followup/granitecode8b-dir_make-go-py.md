The error message indicates that there is an issue with the indentation of the `try-except` block in the Python code. The `try-except` block must be indented to indicate that it is part of the `mkdir_p()` function. Additionally, the error message suggests that the line containing the `try-except` block is missing an indentation.
The fix involves adding the correct indentation to the `try-except` block so that it is properly nested within the `mkdir_p()` function. Once this is done, the code should run without any errors.
Here's the corrected code:
```py
import os
def mkdir_p(path):
 try:
 os.makedirs(path, mode=0o770)
 except OSError as e:
 if e.errno != errno.EEXIST or not os.path.isdir(path):
 raise
```
This code uses the `os` module to create a directory and any missing parents. If the directory already exists, it returns successfully without raising an error. The `try-except` block is used to handle potential errors that may occur during the directory creation process. 
Note that the mode argument in `os.makedirs()` is specified as an octal number (e.g., 0o770) to ensure cross-platform compatibility. Additionally, the `errno` module is used to check if the error was due to a directory already existing. Finally, the `os.path.isdir()` method is used to verify that the path exists and is a directory before raising an error.
