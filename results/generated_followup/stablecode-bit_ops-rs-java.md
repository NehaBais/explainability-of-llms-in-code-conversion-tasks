The error in the code is that it uses the bitwise NOT operator `!` with an integer operand of `a`, which leads to a type mismatch error. The fix for this issue is to use the unary minus operator `-` instead of the bitwise NOT operator `!`.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) 
{
    int a = 105;
    int b = 91;

    System.out.printf("a      = %8d%n", a);
    System.out.printf("b      = %8d%n", b);
    System.out.printf("a | b  = %8d%n", a | b);
    System.out.printf("a & b  = %8d%n", a & b);
    System.out.printf("a ^ b  = %8d%n", a ^ b);
    System.out.printf("-a     = %8d%n", -a);
    System.out.printf("a << 3  = %8d%n", a << 3);
    System.out.printf("a >> 3  = %8d%n", a >> 3);
}
}
```

This corrected code uses the unary minus operator `-` instead of the bitwise NOT operator `!`. This ensures that the operand for the unary minus operator is of type `int`, which resolves the error.
