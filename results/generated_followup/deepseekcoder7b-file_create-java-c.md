The error message indicates that the compiler does not recognize 'mkdir' function, which is used to create directories. This can happen if libcutils library (which includes mkdir) is not linked during compilation. 

To fix this, you need to link libcutils -lcutils at the end of your gcc command line.

Here is the corrected C code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  FILE *file;

   // create "output.txt" in the current directory
  file = fopen("output.txt", "w");
  if (file == NULL) {
    printf("Could not open/create output.txt\n");
    exit(1);
  } else {
    fclose(file);
  }

   // create directory "docs" in the current directory
  if (mkdir("docs", 0755) == -1) {
    printf("Could not create docs\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
