The error is related to the preview features of Java 17, which are not enabled by default. To resolve this issue, we need to add `--enable-preview` to the compilation command. The corrected code is as follows:
```java
String s1 = "Hello";
s1 += ", World!";
System.out.println(s1);
```
Note that in Java 17, you can use `String s1 = "Hello" + ", World!";` instead of the `+=` operator for string concatenation. However, using the `+=` operator is more idiomatic and recommended.
