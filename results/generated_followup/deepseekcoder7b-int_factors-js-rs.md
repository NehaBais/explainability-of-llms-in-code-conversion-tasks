The error message indicates that there are some syntax issues with Rust code provided. 

For example, unexpected characters like `\u{ff5c}` or `\u{2581}` in the code which is not valid in Rust. The line ending of Python-like `<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>}` is also invalid in Rust.

The method `itertools::Itertools::collect_vec()` isn't recognized because it's likely that your project doesn't have the itertools crate. 

To fix these errors, we need to remove the unnecessary characters and add the missing dependency if not already present in Cargo.toml:
```rust
extern crate itertools;
use itertools::Itertools;

fn factors(num: u32) -> Vec<u32> {
    let mut n_factors = (1..=((f64::from(num)).sqrt() as u32)).filter(|i| num % i == 0).collect::<Vec<u32>>();
    
    if ((f64::from(num)).sqrt().ceil() as u32) != *n_factors.last().unwrap(){
        let last = n_factors.pop().unwrap();
        n_factors.append(&mut (1..last).map(|i| num  / i).collect::<Vec<u32>>());
    }
    
    // sort in ascending order
    n_factors.sort();
    
    return n_factors;
}

fn main() {
   println!("{:?}", factors(45));  // [1,3,5,9,15,45]
   println!("{:?}", factors(53));  // [1,53]
   println!("{:?}", factors(64));  // [1,2,4,8,16,32,64]
}
```
This should solve the error and provide you with correct Rust code.
