This issue is due to the fact that C++ does not have built-in support for `#include`. Instead, it uses libraries provided by the compiler. Hence, when we are trying to include the header file `<stdio.h>` in our program, the compiler does not understand it and hence leads to this error.

The fix is to replace the `#include` directive with a valid library directive for C++. If you're using GCC or Clang as your compiler, you can include `#include <stdio.h>` in your program. However, the above syntax might not work if you are using another compiler like MSVC (which uses different header files) or other Unix-based compilers.

The corrected code is:
```C++
// C++ Code
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std;
int main() { 
    int nums2factor[] = { 2059, 223092870, 3135, 45 }; 
    Factors ftors = { NULL, 0};  
    // Code ...   
}
```
