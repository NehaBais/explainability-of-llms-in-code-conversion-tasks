The error occurs because Java is case-sensitive and "In" is written as "in". The correct variable to use is "in" instead of "In".

The fix is to change "In" to "in" in the line.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
public static String str_fromstr(String s, String in, int m) {
    int index = s.indexOf(in); // correct variable to use is "in" instead of "In"
    return substring(s, index, m);
}
```
