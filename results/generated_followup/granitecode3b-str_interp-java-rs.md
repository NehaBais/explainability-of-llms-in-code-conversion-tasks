Error: Expected item, found keyword `let`
 Fix: Remove "let" keyword from the first line.
 Revised code block:
```rs
String adjective = "little";
let lyric = format!("Mary had a {} lamb", adjective);
```
 Explanation: The error occurred because the Rust compiler expected an item (such as a variable, function, or struct) to be defined before using it. In this case, the `let` keyword was used before the `adjective` variable, which caused the error. By removing the "let" keyword, the code compiles without errors.
