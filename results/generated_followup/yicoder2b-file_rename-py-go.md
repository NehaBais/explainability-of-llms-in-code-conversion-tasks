The error `/tmp/yicoder2b-file_rename-py-go.go:1:1: expected 'package', found 'import'` is caused by Go's strict package-style import syntax. The Python code you have does not actually import a module, but it includes an import statement at the top of its script. This can be resolved by changing the import to a valid Go import statement (i.e. `"os/exec"`), which is required for os.rename operation in Golang.

The corrected Golang code would look like this:
```go
import (
    "os/exec"
)

func main() {
    if err := exec.ChangeFileMode("input.txt", "output.txt", 0644); err != nil {
        panic(err) // or return err for different use cases
    }
    // The above call changes the permissions of input.txt to be 644 (equivalent to 444 in octal), which is read/write for owner and group but no others. This will throw an error if `input.txt` does not exist yet.
    if err := exec.ChangeDir("docs", "mydocs"); err != nil {
        panic(err) // or return err for different use cases
    }
    // The above call changes the current working directory to mydocs. This will throw an error if `mydocs` does not exist yet.
}
```
This should compile successfully, provided that the directories "input.txt" and "docs" both reside in the same file system location as where this script is run.
