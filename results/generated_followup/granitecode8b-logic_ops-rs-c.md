The error message indicates that there are several issues with the code. Firstly, the `printf` function is being used without including the `stdio.h` header file, which contains the declaration for this function. Secondly, the format specifiers used in the `printf` statements are incorrect for printing boolean values (e.g., `%d` instead of `%d`). Finally, there are missing terminating double quotes (`"`) and semicolons (`;`) at the end of each line.
The fix involves including the `stdio.h` header file, correcting the format specifiers to use `%d` for printing boolean values, and adding the missing semicolons and double quotes. Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include 
void boolean_ops(int a, int b) {
 printf("%d and %d -> %d
", a, b, a && b);
 printf("%d or %d -> %d
", a, b, a || b);
 printf("%d xor %d -> %d
", a, b, a ^ b);
 printf("not %d -> %d
", a, !a);
}
int main() {
 boolean_ops(1, 1);
 boolean_ops(1, 0);
 boolean_ops(0, 1);
 boolean_ops(0, 0);
 return 0;
}
```
Note that in C, logical values are represented as integers (0 for false and non-zero for true). The `&&`, `||`, and `^` operators work as expected with integer values. The `!` operator negates the value, which is equivalent to subtracting it from 1. The `printf()` function is used to print the output.
