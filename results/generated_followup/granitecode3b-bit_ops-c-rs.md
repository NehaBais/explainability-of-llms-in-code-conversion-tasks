The error message indicates that there is no `main` function in the `granitecode3b_bit_ops_c_rs` crate. To fix this, you need to add a `main` function to the file. Here's an example of what the corrected code would look like:
```rs
fn main() {
    bitwise(10, 5);
}

fn bitwise(a: i32, b: i32) -> () {
    println!("a and b: {}", a & b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a | b);
    println!("a xor b: {}", a ^ b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);
    println!("a << n: {}", a << b); /* left shift */
    println!("a >> n: {}", a >> b); /* on most platforms: arithmetic right shift */
    /* convert the signed integer into unsigned, so it will perform logical shift */
    let c = a as u32;
    println!("c >> b: {}", c >> b); /* logical right shift */
    return ();
}
```
In this example, I've added a `main` function at the end of the file. The `bitwise` function is called within the `main` function to demonstrate its functionality.
