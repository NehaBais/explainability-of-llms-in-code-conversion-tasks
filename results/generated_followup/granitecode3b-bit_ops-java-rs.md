The error is that the `rotate_left` and `rotate_right` methods on `i32` return `u32`, which means they can only handle unsigned integers. However, the input to these methods is an `i32`. To fix this, you can either use a different method from the standard library or convert the `i32` to a `u32` and panic if the converted value doesn't fit:
```rs
fn bitwise(a: i32, b: i32) {
    println!("a rol b: {}", a.rotate_left(b as u32)); //rotate left, Java 1.5+
    println!("a ror b: {}", a.rotate_right(b as u32)); //rotate right, Java 1.5+
}
```
The fix is to use the `u32` variant of these methods and convert the second argument `b` to `u32` before calling them.
