This error appears due to incorrect usage of JavaScript and Rust syntax, which results in unexpected behavior or errors when running. 

The `compare` function in JavaScript can't handle type coercion for two different types (such as string and number). When using type coercion (`==`) to compare the integers, it will always return true even if they are not equal because both sides are being compared as if they were of the same type which could be a string or an integer.

In Rust, we should use `==` for strict comparison and `===` for checking equality and type (also known as structural equality). If the types are different, this will return false. 

In your original JavaScript code, there is no type coercion being used but standard JavaScript language doesn't allow it for numeric comparisons. Hence the error. Here is the correct Rust version of your JavaScript code:

```rs
fn compare(a: i32, b: i32) {
    if a == b {
        println!("{} equals {}", a, b);
    }
    if a < b {
        println!("{} is less than {}", a, b);
    }
    if a > b {
        println!("{} is greater than {}", a, b);
    }
}
```
This Rust function takes two `i32` integers as input and logs if each integer is equal to, less than or greater than the other.
