The error message is indicating that the Rust compiler did not find the `main` function, which is required for entry point of executable programs.

To fix this, we must add a `main` function to the program. The main function serves as the starting point for executing Rust programs.

Here is the corrected code:

```rs
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}

fn main() {
    print_logic(true, false);
}
```

In this corrected code, we added a `main` function that calls the `print_logic` function with two boolean arguments.
