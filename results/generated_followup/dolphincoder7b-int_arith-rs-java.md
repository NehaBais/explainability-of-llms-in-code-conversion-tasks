The error occurs because there is no main method or class to begin execution from, so the compiler doesn't know which part of the code should be compiled and executed.

To fix this issue, we need to add a `main` method that defines the entry point for our program.

Now, when you compile and execute the corrected code, it will work properly.
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter two integers: ");
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println("sum:               " + (a+b));
        System.out.println("difference:        " + (a-b));
        System.out.println("product:           " + (a*b));
        System.out.println("integer quotient:  " + (a/b) + " (rounded towards zero)"); // truncates towards zero
        System.out.println("remainder:         " + (a%b) + " (same sign as first operand)");
    }
}
```
