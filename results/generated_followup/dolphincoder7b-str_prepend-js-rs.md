The error occurs because Rust requires variables to be declared before being used, specifically within the same scope. In this case, we're trying to declare `s` before calling `.to_string()`. To fix this issue, we can move the declaration of `s` below the line where it is assigned:

```rust
let mut s = ", World".to_string(); // Create a string variable equal to any text value.
s.insert(0, "Hello  ");   // Prepend the string variable with another string literal.
println!("{}", s);
```

The corrected code now compiles successfully and prints the desired output.
