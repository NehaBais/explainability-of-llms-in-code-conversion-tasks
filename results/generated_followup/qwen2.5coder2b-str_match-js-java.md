The error occurred because `Pattern` is not imported in the given Java program. The import statement for `Pattern` should be added at the beginning of the file.

Error explanation: The compiler cannot find the symbol `Pattern`, which is a class in Java used for pattern matching and regular expressions, within the scope of this Java code.

Fix: Add the following line at the beginning of the file:
```java
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
```
Corrections made to the original Java code:

1. Added `import java.util.regex.Pattern;` statement.
2. Corrected variable name from `q2multi` to `matcher`.
3. Corrected method call from `indexOf` to `matcher.find()`.
