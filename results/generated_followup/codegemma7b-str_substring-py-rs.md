The error occurs because `let` is used to declare variables inside functions, but it cannot be used for global variables in Rust. The fix is to use `const` or `static` instead of `let` for global variables.

```rust
const s: &str = "abcdefgh";
let n, m, char, chars = 2, 3, 'd', "cd";

// ... code as before ...
```
