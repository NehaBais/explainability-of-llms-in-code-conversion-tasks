The error message indicates that there are mismatches between expected types due to invalid type conversions or incorrect usages of functions causing mismatched types on both lhs (left-hand side) and rhs (right-hand side) of expressions. The primary issue is related to the use of a `usize` variable where a `u32` was expected, likely caused by incorrectly using iterator variables in the loop.

To fix this problem we can convert `x` from `usize` to `u32` within the loop by using the `try_into()` function which will panic if the conversion is not possible (which should never happen here) or `unwrap()`, a method that directly returns the value if it's `Ok(t)`.

Here's how you can correct this in your code:

```rust
fn factor(n: u32) -> Vec<u32> {
    let mut factors1 = Vec::new();
    for x in 1..=((n as usize).sqrt() as u32) {
        if n % x == 0 {
            factors1.push(x.try_into().unwrap());
            let y = (n / x).try_into().unwrap();
            if y != x {
                factors1.push(y);
            }
        }
    }

    let mut factors2: Vec<u32> = factors1.into();
    factors2.sort();
    factors2
}
```
