The error is caused by Rust's requirement that crate names must be valid Rust identifiers, which do not include dots ('.').

To fix the error, you can change the name of the crate to something without dots. For example, `qwen2_5coder2b_file_rename_rust`. Here is the corrected code:

```rs
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").unwrap();
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").unwrap();

    fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt").unwrap();
    fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs").unwrap();
}
```
