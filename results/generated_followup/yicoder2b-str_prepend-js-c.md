The error "call to undeclared library function 'strcpy' with type 'char *(char *, const char *)'; ISO C99 and later do not support implicit function declarations [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]" arises because the code tries to use `strcpy()` without first declaring it. Similarly, "call to undeclared library function 'strlen' with type 'unsigned long (const char *)'; ISO C99 and later do not support implicit function declarations [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]" arises from the same reason - `strlen` is also used without being declared.

To fix these errors, you need to include the header <string.h> in your C program that provides prototypes for string handling functions such as strcpy and strlen. This is necessary because these library functions are declared in this header file.

The corrected code (assuming that these were not explicitly provided) would be:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char s[100] = ", World"; // Initial string
  const char *prefix = "Hello";

  // Append prefix to the string
  strcpy(s + strlen(prefix), prefix);

  printf("%s\n", s);
  return 0;
}
```
This corrected code will compile successfully without any warnings.
