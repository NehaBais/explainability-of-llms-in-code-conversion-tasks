Error: Call to undeclared library function 'printf' or 'sprintf' with type 'int (const char *, ...)'. To fix, include the header <stdio.h> or explicitly provide a declaration for the function.
Fix: Include the header <stdio.h> and declare both functions explicitly.
```c
#include
int main() {
  char *s = "hello";
  printf("%s", s);
  
  char s1[20];
  sprintf(s1, "%s world", s);
  printf("%s", s1);
  
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the compiler was unable to find the declarations for the `printf` and `sprintf` functions. To fix this, we included the header <stdio.h> and explicitly declared both functions using the function name and parameter types. This allowed the compiler to resolve the calls to the functions and avoid the "undeclared" error.
