The error occurs because of incorrect usage of `std::rename` in C++. The error is in this line - `if  (std::rename("docs", "mydocs") != <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜ 0)`, it seems like the author of the code has tried to use syntax that does not exist in C++.

The fix would be just to call `std::rename()` function with correct parameters and check for any errors during renaming operation:
```cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  if (std::rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0) {
    std::cerr << "Error renaming 'input.txt' to 'output.txt'\n";
  }
  
  if (std::rename("docs", "mydocs") != 0) {
    std::cerr << "Error renaming 'docs' to 'mydocs'\n";
  }

  return 0;
```
