The error is caused by an incorrect namespace declaration in C++ file. A namespace is a scope that provides a means of grouping together declarations so that they can be referred to with a single name. It doesn't seem to be related to the original Go code as it was written in `<std>` namespace (which is not declared), but it could be caused by the new `using` directive added in C++11 to bring all filesystem functions into the global scope.

In a C++ program, you should define your own namespaces if you want to avoid cluttering of the global namespace with system-specific functions or definitions. 

Here is how you can rewrite the corrected code for C++:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>
using namespace std;
using namespace filesystem;

int main() {
    path input_file("input.txt");
    if (exists(input_file)) rename(input_file, "output.txt");

    path docs_dir("docs");
    if (is_directory(docs_dir)) rename(docs_dir, "mydocs");
}
```
This code will first check if `input.txt` exists and then rename it to `output.txt`. If the directory `docs` exists, it will be renamed to `mydocs`. This assumes that you have access permissions to rename files/directories in the filesystem where your program is running.
