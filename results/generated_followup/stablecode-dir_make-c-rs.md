The error in this code is that it's attempting to use an outdated `Path` struct from the `std::fs` module, rather than using the updated `std::path::Path` struct for constructing a new path.

To fix this issue, we can update the code to use the correct `std::path::Path` struct for constructing a new path. We will also remove any unnecessary imports or statements from the original code.

Here is the corrected code:
```rs
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn create_directory(path: &str) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
    let path = Path::new(path);

    if let Some(parent) = path.parent() {
        fs::create_dir_all(parent)?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```
