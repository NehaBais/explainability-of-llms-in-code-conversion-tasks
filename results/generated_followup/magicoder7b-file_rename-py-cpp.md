 The error "fatal error: 'boost/filesystem.hpp' file not found" occurs because the program is trying to include `<boost/filesystem.hpp>` but it cannot find this file. This file is part of the Boost C++ libraries which need to be installed in order for your code to compile and run correctly.

To fix this, you need to install these libraries. You can do so using package managers such as Homebrew (on macOS) or apt-get (on Ubuntu). 

After the installation completes successfully, you should be able to compile and run your C++ code without encountering any errors.

Here's the corrected C++ code:
```cpp
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <system_error>

using namespace std;
namespace fs = boost::filesystem;

int main() {
  try {
    // Renaming file "input.txt" to "output.txt" and directory "docs" to
    // "mydocs" in the current working directory
    if (!fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt")) {
      throw system_error(errno, system_category(),
                         "Failed renaming 'input.txt' to 'output.txt'");
    }
    if (!fs::rename("docs", "mydocs")) {
      throw system_error(errno, system_category(),
                         "Failed renaming 'docs' to 'mydocs'");
    }

    // Renaming file "input.txt" to "output.txt" and directory "docs" to
    // "mydocs" in the filesystem root
    if (!fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")) {
      throw system_error(errno, system_category(),
                         "Failed renaming '/input.txt' to '/output.txt'");
    }
    if (!fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs")) {
      throw system_error(errno, system_category(),
                         "Failed renaming '/docs' to '/mydocs'");
    }
  } catch (const system_error &e) {
    cout << "Error: " << e.what() << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```
