Error: The C compiler does not recognize the type "bool" as a valid data type.
Fix: Replace "bool" with "int" to make it a valid data type in C.
Corrected Code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void printLogic(int a, int b) {
  printf("a and b is %d\n", (int)a && b);
  printf("a or b is %d\n", (int)a || b);
  printf("not a is %d\n", !(int)a);
}
```
