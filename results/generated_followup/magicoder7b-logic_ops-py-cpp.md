 The error occurs because the linker cannot find the `main` symbol, which is needed for execution of the program (it's where main() function is defined). It means that there is no entry point in your C++ code. 

The fix would be to define a `main()` function, even if it does nothing but return 0. Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void logic(bool a, bool b) {
  cout << "a and b: " << (a && b) << endl;
  cout << "a or b: " << (a || b) << endl;
  cout << "not a: " << !a << endl;
}

// Entry point of the program.
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```
