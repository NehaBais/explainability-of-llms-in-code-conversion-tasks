The error occurred because the compiler was unable to find the main function, which is the entry point of the program. The fix is to define the main function in the C code. Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("a AND b: %d\n", a && b);
  printf("a OR b: %d\n", a || b);
  printf("NOT a: %d\n", !a);
  return 0;
}
```
