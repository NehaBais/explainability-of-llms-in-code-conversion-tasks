The error `SyntaxError: unmatched ')` is caused by an issue with the syntax of the code enclosed in backticks. Specifically, there seems to be an unmatched parenthesis `)`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that any parentheses used in the code are properly matched. Specifically, for each opening parenthesis `(`, there should be a corresponding closing parenthesis `)` at the same nesting level. Moreover, the nesting of parentheses should be consistent with the code's logical structure.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import os
import stat

def create_file(fn):
    try:
        with open(fn, 'w') as f:
            pass
        print("File", fn, "created!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        return

def create_dir(dn):
    try:
        os.mkdir(dn, mode=stat.S_IRWXU|stat.S_IRGRP|stat.S_IRWXO))
        print("Directory", dn, "created!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        return

def main():
    create_file("input.txt")
    create_file("/input.txt")
    create_dir("docs")
    create_dir("/docs")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
