 The error occurs because the linker cannot find the "main" symbol, which is usually the entry point of an executable program. In C++, if you do not provide an explicit main function, the compiler will automatically generate a default "main" function for you. However, this default "main" function only exists in code compiled with the C++ standard library (libstdc++) and will not work in environments that use libc (like on bare metal or in embedded systems). 

To fix the error, you need to provide your own main() function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void logic(bool a, bool b) {
  std::cout << "a AND b: " << (a && b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a OR b: " << (a || b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "NOT a: " << (!a) << std::endl;
}

// Add this function to provide main()
int main() {
    logic(true, false); // Replace with your own test cases.
    return 0;
}
```
In the fix, I added a `main()` function where you can call your `logic` function with any boolean values. This function is the entry point of your program in C++.
