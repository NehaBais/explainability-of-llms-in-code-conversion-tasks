The error is that the compiler cannot find the header files for C++ standard library, which are required to compile the code. The fix is to add the appropriate include statements at the beginning of the code.
Here's the corrected code:
```
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 std::string A = "Hello";
 std::string B = "Hello";
 if (A == B) {
 std::cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B << "' are lexically equal." << std::endl;
 } else {
 std::cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B << "' are not lexically equal." << std::endl;
 }
 if (A < B) {
 std::cout << "'" << A << "' is lexically before '" << B << "'." << std::endl;
 } else {
 std::cout << "'" << A << "' is not lexically before '" << B << "'." << std::endl;
 }
 if (A > B) {
 std::cout << "'" << A << "' is lexically after '" << B << "'." << std::endl;
 } else {
 std::cout << "'" << A << "' is not lexically after '" << B << "'." << std::endl;
 }
 return 0;
}
```
