The error is due to comparing an `i32` variable with a `u32` constant, resulting in mismatched types as Rust does not automatically convert between integer types. The fix is to add a conversion from `usize` to `u32` using the `try_into()` function, which will panic if the converted value doesn't fit.
Here is the corrected code:
```rs
pub fn bitwise(mut a: i32, mut b: u32) {
    b = match b as usize {
        b if b < 32 => b.try_into().unwrap(), // Convert usize to u32 and panic if it doesn't fit
        _ => 31, 
    };

    println!("a AND b: {}", a & (b as i32));
    // rest of the function remains the same...
}
```
