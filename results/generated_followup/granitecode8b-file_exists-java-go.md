The error occurs because the first line of the code is enclosed in backticks, which indicates that it is meant to be executed as Golang code. However, this causes the first line to be interpreted as a file path rather than Golang code. To fix this, you can either move the first line outside of the fenced code block or change the first line to `package main`. The corrected code would look like this:
```go
package main
import (
 "fmt"
 "os"
)
func main() {
 file, _ := os.Open("docs/input.txt")
 defer file.Close()
 _, err := file.Stat()
 if err == nil {
 fmt.Println("File exists")
 } else {
 fmt.Println("File does not exist")
 }
 file, _ = os.Open("/docs/input.txt")
 defer file.Close()
 _, err = file.Stat()
 if err == nil {
 fmt.Println("File exists")
 } else {
 fmt.Println("File does not exist")
 }
}
```
