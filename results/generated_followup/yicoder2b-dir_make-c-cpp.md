This error means that the `F_OK` constant is not defined somewhere where this code is included. This may be due to an earlier compilation problem, or it might be a problem with how the code was compiled. 

Here are some potential solutions:
1. Ensure you include <unistd.h> before <sys/stat.h> as `F_OK` comes from <unistd.h>. Check if you have included this header file correctly. If not, include it before the other header files in your code.
2. Make sure that the directory is created when the program starts. This can be done by using the `mkdir()` function in combination with its flags, like `0755` for permissions.
3. Try running the corrected version of your code locally to see if there are any specific compilation errors or other issues. If so, they could help point towards a possible problem with how your local environment is setup.
4. You can add your own definition for `F_OK` in case it's not defined somewhere else. Replace the current line with something like this:
```c++
#define F_OK 0
```
