The error occurred because the linker was unable to find the `_main` function, which is the entry point for the program. This means that the `mkdirp` function was not properly linked with the rest of the program.

To fix this issue, you need to make sure that the `mkdirp` function is properly defined and linked with the rest of the program. This can be done by adding a `main` function in the code and calling the `mkdirp` function from within it. Here's an example of how the corrected code could look:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void mkdirp(const char *path, void (*callback)(int)) {
  struct stat sb;
  int ret = 0;

  if (stat(path, &sb) == -1) {
    // The directory does not exist, create it and its parents.
    ret = mkdir(path, S_IRWXU | S_IRGRP | S_IXGRP | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH);
  } else if (sb.st_mode & S_IFDIR) {
    // The directory exists, return successfully.
    callback(0);
  } else {
    // The path is not a directory, error out.
    fprintf(stderr, "mkdirp: %s: Not a directory\n", path);
    callback(-1);
  }
}

int main() {
  mkdirp("./path/to/dir", my_callback);
  return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `main` function is defined and calls the `mkdirp` function with the appropriate arguments. The `my_callback` function can then be implemented as needed.
