 The error message "invalid operation: a < b (operator < not defined on interface)" is telling us that the "<" operator, which is commonly used for comparison, isn't defined for our interfaces "a" and "b". 

To fix this, we need to tell Go how to compare objects of different types. We can do this by using a type assertion (`assertedType := a.(type)`) or a conversion (for example, `float64(a)`).

Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unicode"
)

func compare(a interface{}, b interface{}) {
	fmt.Printf("%v is of type %T and %v is of type %T\n", a, a, b, b)

	if a.(int) < b.(int) {
		fmt.Printf("%v is strictly less than  %v\n", a, b)
	}
	if a.(int) <= b.(int) {
		fmt.Printf("%v is less than or equal to %v\n", a, b)
	}
	if a.(int) > b.(int) {
		fmt.Printf("%v is strictly greater than  %v\n", a, b)
	}
	if a.(int) >= b.(int) {
		fmt.Printf("%v is greater than or equal to %v\n", a, b)
	}
	if a == b {
		fmt.Printf("%v is equal to %v\n", a, b)
	}
	if a != b {
		fmt.Printf("%v is not equal to %v\n", a, b)
	}
	if a == a && a != b {
		fmt.Printf("%v has object identity with %v\n", a, b)
	}
	if a == a && a == b {
		fmt.Printf("%v has negated object identity with %v\n", a, b)
	}
}

func main() {
	compare(24, 123)
}
```
In this code, we've used type assertions to convert "a" and "b" into integers before performing the comparison. This will work as long as both a and b are comparable types (i.e., numbers).
