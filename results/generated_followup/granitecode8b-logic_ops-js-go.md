The error message indicates that the code is trying to declare a function named `logic`, but it seems to be missing the `package` declaration at the beginning of the file. To fix this, we need to add the `package main` statement at the top of the file to specify that it's part of the `main` package.
Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main
func logic(a, b bool) {
 fmt.Println("a AND b:", a && b)
 fmt.Println("a OR b:", a || b)
 fmt.Println("NOT a:", !a)
}
``` 
This code declares the `logic` function as part of the `main` package and uses the `fmt` package to print the output. The `bool` type is used to represent logical values, and the function takes two arguments of type `bool`, and returns nothing. The output is printed using the `fmt.Println()` function.
