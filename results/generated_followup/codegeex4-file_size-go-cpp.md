The error occurred because `std::filesystem` is not part of the standard C++ library until C++17. The fix would be to ensure that the compiler supports at least C++17 or higher. Below is the corrected version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

void printFileSize(const std::string &f) {
  std::ifstream file(f);
  if (file.good()) {
    file.seekg(0, std::ios_base::end);
    std::cout << "Size of the file: " << f << ": " << file.tellg() << " bytes\n";
  } else {
    std::cerr << "File does not exist: " << f << "\n";
  }
}

int main() {
  printFileSize("input.txt");
  printFileSize("/input.txt");

  return 0;
}
```

This program uses the ifstream object to read files and seek to the end of each file using the seekg method. The size can then be obtained by obtaining the current position of the stream pointer with tellg, which is adjusted to point to the beginning of the file.
