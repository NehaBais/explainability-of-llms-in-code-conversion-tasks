The error message indicates that there is a syntax issue with the function definition. Specifically, the `>` character at the end of the first line of the function definition is causing the compiler to expect a closing bracket (`}`) for the function body. The compiler is expecting to find a closing bracket because the code block begins with a function declaration.
The fix is to remove the extra `>` character from the function definition. This will allow the Rust compiler to parse the code correctly and generate the expected output.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
fn factors(num: i32) -> Vec> {
 let mut result = vec![];
 for i in 1..=(num as f64).sqrt() as usize {
 if num % i == 0 {
 result.push(i);
 if i != num / i {
 result.push(num / i);
 }
 }
 }
 result.sort_unstable();
 result
}
fn main() {
 println!("{:?}", factors(45)); // [1,3,5,9,15,45]
 println!("{:?}", factors(53)); // [1,53]
 println!("{:?}", factors(64)); // [1,2,4,8,16,32,64]
}
```
The corrected code is the same as the original code, with the extra `>` character removed from the function definition. The Rust compiler should now be able to parse the code without any errors.
