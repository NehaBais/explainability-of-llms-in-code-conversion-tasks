The error message indicates that there are missing include statements for `stdio.h` and `string.h`. Additionally, there are undeclared library functions used in the code, such as `printf`, `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcat`. These errors must be fixed before the program can compile successfully. 
The fix is to add the necessary include statements at the beginning of the file and declare the required functions using the appropriate prototypes. The corrected code is shown below:
```c
#include
#include
#include
int main() {
  // text assigned to a string variable
  char s[] = "hello";

  // output string variable
  printf("%sn", s);

  // this output requested by original task description, although
  // not really required by current wording of task description.
  printf("%s literaln", s);

  // concatenate variable and literal, assign result to another string variable
  char s2[strlen(s) + strlen(" literal") + 1];
  strcpy(s2, s);
  strcat(s2, " literal");

  // output second string variable
  printf("%sn", s2);

  return 0;
}
```
