**Error:** The `std::format()` function is not recognized because the C++ version being used does not support C++20 or later, which introduced this feature.

**Fix:** Use `sprintf()` instead of `std::format()` since it's available in all versions of C++. However, remember to manually manage buffer sizes and convert `std::string` to C-style string using `.c_str()`.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>

int main()
{
    std::string extra = "little";
    char new_str[50];
    sprintf(new_str, "Mary had a %s lamb.", extra.c_str());
    std::cout << new_str;
    return 0;
}
```
