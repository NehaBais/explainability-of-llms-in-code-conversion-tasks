The error is caused by Rust's syntax rules for crate names which do not allow periods (`.`). To fix it, we need to either rename our crate or use another name that does not include a period. Here's how you can rewrite the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Define the string variable as a literal
    let s: &str = ", World";

    // Prepend the string variable with another string literal
    let result = "Hello" + s;

    // Print the resulting string
    println!("{}", result);
}
```

This code is now valid and should compile without errors.
