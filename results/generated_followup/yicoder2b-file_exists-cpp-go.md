The error `/tmp/yicoder2b-file_exists-cpp-go.go:9:20: syntax error: unexpected name exists at end of statement` is caused by an incorrect usage of the `name exists` operator in Go's filesystem package.

Go's `os.Path exists()` function checks if a file or directory with that path actually exists on the system, and returns true if it does, otherwise false. However, when using this inside the context of a function, it can't properly evaluate whether the given path refers to a directory or not because the existence check is done at the end of the statement, meaning it doesn't know if the specified file already exists or not before trying to access its properties like size. Therefore, using `exists()` without further checks may result in a syntax error.

To resolve this issue, you can use Go's `os.IsDir()` function which is designed for that exact purpose - it returns true if path refers to an existing directory and false otherwise. So your corrected code would look like:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func fileExists(path string) bool {
    return os.IsDir(path) // Returns true if path is a directory, false otherwise
}

func main() {
    // Check current working directory
    fmt.Printf("'input.txt'\n%v\n",fileExists("input.txt"))
    fmt.Printf("'zero_length.txt'\n%v\n",fileExists("zero_length.txt"))
    // Check root directory
    fmt.Printf("/docs/input.txt\n%v\n",fileExists("/docs/input.txt"))
    fmt.Printf("/docs/zero_length.txt\n%v\n",fileExists("/docs/zero_length.txt"))
}
```
This code will correctly return whether an input file or directory exists and is a directory or not in the filesystem root or any other directory.
