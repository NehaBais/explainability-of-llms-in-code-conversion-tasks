 The error is occurring because C99 doesn't support implicit function declarations. This means that when we don't declare a function before using it, the compiler will give an error. `strerror` and `mkdir` are functions we're using in our program but the compiler hasn't seen them before so it gives an error.

The fix is to include <string.h> and <sys/stat.h>. The former provides the function prototype for strerror, and the latter allows us to make directories with mkdir.

Here's how you can correct this:
```c
#include <dirent.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h> // For strerror
#include <sys/stat.h> // For mkdir
#include <unistd.h>
```
In the corrected code, the C standard library's `strerror()` and `mkdir()` functions are included which resolve the issues related to implicit function declarations.
