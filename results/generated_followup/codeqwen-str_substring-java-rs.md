Error: The `self` parameter is only allowed in associated functions, while in Rust, it's a keyword used to refer to the instance of a struct or enum that the method belongs to.

Fix: To fix this error, replace `&self` with `str`, assuming you are implementing methods for a string type.

Corrected code:
```rust
pub fn substring(s: &str, n: usize) -> &str {
    // implementation here
}

pub fn substring_with_length(s: &str, c: char) -> Option<&str> {
    // implementation here
}

pub fn substring_range(s: &str, start: usize, end: usize) -> &str {
    // implementation here
}
```
