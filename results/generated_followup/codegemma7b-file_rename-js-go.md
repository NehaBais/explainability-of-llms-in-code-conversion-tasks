The error occurs because the `import` statement is placed at the top level of the file, outside of any function or package. In Golang, all code must be inside a package.

**Fix:** Move the `import` statement to the beginning of the file, after the package declaration.

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
)

func moveFilesAndDirectories() {
	// ...
}

func main() {
	moveFilesAndDirectories()
}
```
