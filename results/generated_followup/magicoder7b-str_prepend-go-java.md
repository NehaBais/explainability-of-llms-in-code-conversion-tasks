 The error in Java is due to the fact that implicitly declared classes are preview features which are disabled by default. Preview features allow for experimentation and development of new features before they become part of the official Java language. 

To fix this issue, you would need to enable the "implicitly declared classes" feature using the `--enable-preview` flag while compiling your program. But, in general, it's not recommended to use implicit classes because they can lead to confusion and reduce code readability. 

Alternatively, if you are using Java 14 or later version, you could also use the new text block feature which allows for cleaner syntax when dealing with string literals containing multiple lines:

```java
var s = "world!";
s = "Hello, " + s;
```

In both cases, `var` is used instead of `String` to simplify typing and makes the code more succinct. It can also be replaced by any other types like `int`, `boolean`, etc., depending on what you are assigning to it. This feature has been introduced in Java 10 as part of an effort to modernize Java syntax and make the language more expressive and easier to read and write.
