Error: 
- The `#include` statements are not declared, causing a compilation error.
- The use of `std::` before the variable names is not recognized by the compiler, also resulting in an error.
Fix: 
- Declare the include statements at the beginning of the file using the proper syntax for including header files.
- Remove the unnecessary `std::` declarations from the variable and function definitions.
Corrected Code:
```cpp
#include 
int main() {
  std::string adjective = "little";
  std::string lyric = "Mary had a " + adjective + " lamb";
  std::cout << lyric << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The first error is caused by the fact that the `#include` statements are not declared before being used in the code. In C++, include statements need to be at the beginning of a file, after any system-specific includes and before all other code. The fix is to declare the include statements at the beginning of the file using the proper syntax for including header files.
The second error is caused by the use of `std::` before the variable names. In C++, all variables and function definitions should be declared without `std::`. The fix is to remove the unnecessary `std::` declarations from the variable and function definitions.
The corrected code uses the same framework and technology as the original Java code, but addresses the errors by declaring the include statements and removing the unnecessary `std::` declarations.
