 The error message "runtime.main_mainÂ·f: function main is undeclared in the main package" occurs because GoLang does not have a "main()" function by default when starting an application. This is necessary to get the control of execution as the entry point for all the functions and procedures which need to be executed.

To fix this, you must write a main() function that calls your logic function with some boolean arguments like so:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func logic(a bool, b bool) {
	fmt.Printf("a AND b: %v\n", a && b)
	fmt.Printf("a OR b: %v\n", a || b)
	fmt.Printf("NOT a: %v\n", !a)
}

func main() {
	logic(true, false)
}
```

In this way we have the control of the execution and our function logic gets executed.
