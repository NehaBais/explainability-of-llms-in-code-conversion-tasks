 The error message indicates that there is no member named 'filesystem' within the std namespace, which is true for C++17 onwards where `<filesystem>` library was introduced as a part of standard library. If you are using an older version of C++, you might need to implement a different solution. For C++17 and above, here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <filesystem> // C++17 standard library
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::filesystem::path current_directory{"input.txt"};
    if (std::filesystem::exists(current_directory))
        std::cout << "File input.txt exists in the current directory." << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "File input.txt does not exist in the current directory."
                  << std::endl;
    
    std::filesystem::path root_directory{
      "/input.txt"}; // Change this to "/docs" for checking docs directory
    if (std::filesystem::exists(root_directory))
        std::cout << "File /input.txt exists in the root directory." << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "File /input.txt does not exist in the root directory."
                  << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
The corrected code uses the `<filesystem>` library to perform file and directory checks on a given path. It first defines a `std::filesystem::path` object with the desired file or directory, then checks whether it exists using `std::filesystem::exists()`. The results are printed out using `std::cout`.
