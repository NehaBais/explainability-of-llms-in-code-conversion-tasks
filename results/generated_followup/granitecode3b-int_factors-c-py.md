The error was caused by not indenting the code inside the `while` loop. The Python interpreter expects all lines of code to be properly indented, and without proper indentation, it throws an error. To fix this issue, simply add four spaces of indentation before the first line of the `while` loop. The corrected code is shown below:
```py
def factor(num):
 factors = []
 divisor = 1
 while divisor * divisor <= num:
 if num % divisor == 0:
 factors.append(divisor)
 factors.append(num // divisor)
 divisor += 1
 return factors
 
nums2factor = [2059, 223092870, 3135, 45]
for num in nums2factor:
 print("Factors of", num, "are:", factor(num))
```
 The fix is simple - add four spaces of indentation before the first line of the `while` loop. This will properly indent all the lines inside the `while` loop and resolve the syntax error.
 

 The corrected code is shown below:
 ```py
def factor(num):
 factors = []
 divisor = 1
 while divisor * divisor <= num:
 if num % divisor == 0:
 factors.append(divisor)
 factors.append(num // divisor)
 divisor += 1
 return factors
 

 nums2factor = [2059, 223092870, 3135, 45]
 for num in nums2factor:
 print("Factors of", num, "are:", factor(num))
```
 The entire corrected code is now enclosed in a single fenced code block.
