The error in the C++ code is that the identifiers "a" and "b" are not declared before being used. To fix this, the user needs to declare the variables "a" and "b" before using them in the if statements. The corrected code should look like this:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::string a("abc");
  std::string b("Bac");

  if (a == b) {
    std::cout << "The strings are equal" << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "The strings are not equal" << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
