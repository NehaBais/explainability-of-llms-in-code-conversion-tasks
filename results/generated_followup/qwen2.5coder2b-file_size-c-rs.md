The error occurs because Rust does not allow file names to start with a period (.) character. The solution is to rename the files `input.txt` to something that does not start with a period.

Here is the corrected code:

```rs
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Read file size from input.txt in the current working directory
    match fs::metadata("current_dir_input.txt") {
        Ok(metadata) => println!("File size of current_dir_input.txt (current directory): {}", metadata.len()),
        Err(err) => eprintln!("Error reading current_dir_input.txt: {}", err),
    }

    // Read file size from /input.txt in the system root
    match fs::metadata("/root_input.txt") {
        Ok(metadata) => println!("File size of /root_input.txt (system root): {}", metadata.len()),
        Err(err) => eprintln!("Error reading /root_input.txt: {}", err),
    }
}
```

Now this code should work as expected without the error message about invalid characters in crate names.
