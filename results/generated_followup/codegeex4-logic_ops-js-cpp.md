The error occurs because C++ programs require a main function, which is used as an entry point for the program to start execution. The program needs a main function to specify where it begins running.

To fix this, we need to define a main function in our C++ code. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void logic(bool a, bool b) {
  std::cout << "a AND b: " << (a && b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a OR b: " << (a || b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "NOT a: " << (!a) << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    logic(true, true);
    return 0;
}
```
