Error: The Java compiler is not able to find the class `String` because it is not imported or part of the default package, so it assumes that it's an implicitly declared class, which is a preview feature that needs to be enabled.

Fix: Add the `--enable-preview` option when compiling the code to enable implicitly declared classes.

Corrected Code:
```java
// Add the --enable-preview option when compiling the code
javac --enable-preview None.java
```
