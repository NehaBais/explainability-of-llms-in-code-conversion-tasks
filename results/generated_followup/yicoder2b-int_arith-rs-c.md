The error you are encountering is due to a missing file (`iostream`) in your C++ program. It's a standard library file for input/output operations in C++, which was not found by the compiler when it tried to include this header file. 

To solve the issue:
You need to make sure that you have included `iostream` in your source file (or wherever you are using it). Here's how you can do it:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    long long a, b; // use long long to avoid overflow
    cin >> a >> b;

    cout << "sum:              " << (a + b) << endl;
    cout << "difference:       " << (a - b) << endl;
    cout << "product:          " << (a * b) << endl;
    cout << "integer quotient: " << (long long)(a / b)
         << endl; // rounds towards zero
                  // you can replace `/` with a function like trunc() or round(),
                  // but it will be more complex and slower
    cout << "remainder:        " << (a % b)
         << endl; // sign of remainder is the same as the first operand if they
                   // are different

    return 0;
}
```
With this change, your code should compile successfully.
