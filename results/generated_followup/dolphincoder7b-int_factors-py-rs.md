The error occurs because `cmp::min` is expecting a type that has a method named `sqrt`. However, `u64` does not have this method in Rust's standard library. 

To fix this issue, we can use the square root function provided by the `num` crate which provides mathematical constants and functions for numerical operations. By importing the necessary `num_bigint::Integer` type from the `num-bigint` crate and then implementing the `sqrt` method on it, we can define a custom `min` function that also works with `u64` values.

Here is the corrected code:
```rust
use num_bigint::Integer;
pub fn factor(n: u64) -> Vec<u64> {
    let min = Integer::from(cmp::min(n, n as f64).sqrt() as u64);
    
    let mut factors1  = vec![];
    for x in Integer::from(0)..=min.clone()  {
        if n % x.to_u64().unwrap() == 0 {
            factors1.push(x.to_u64().unwrap());
            factors1.push(n / x.to_u64().unwrap());
        }
    }
    
    let mut factors2 = vec![];
    for i in factors1  {
        factors2.push(i);
     }
     
     factors2.sort();
     factors2
}
```

In this corrected code, we first import the `Integer` type from the `num-bigint` crate and then use it to define the `min` function as expected by `cmp::min`. 

By using `cmp::min`, we ensure that `n` is less than or equal to its square root. Then, we iterate over all integers in this range (inclusive of 0) and check if each integer divides `n` without a remainder. If it does, we add the factor to our list and continue with the next value.

After populating `factors1`, we create an empty vector `factors2`. We then iterate over all elements in `factors1` and push them back to `factors2`. Finally, we sort `factors2` and return it as the result of the function. This completes the implementation of the `factor` function in Rust.
