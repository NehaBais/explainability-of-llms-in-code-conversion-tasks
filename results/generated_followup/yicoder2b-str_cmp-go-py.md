The error "SyntaxError: invalid syntax" is due to incorrect usage of Python's package declaration. In Go, packages are declared within the header files (`.go`) or `package` directives are used in the top-level scripts. But in your example, you have used `package main` which seems like a script file and not a header file. This causes an error because package name must be unique across a program. If it were declared within a header file (`.go`) then there would be no problem but in the script context (not in header files), Go does not allow more than one `package` declaration per file.
