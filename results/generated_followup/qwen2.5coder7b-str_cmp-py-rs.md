**Error Explanation:** The error occurs because Rust does not allow `.` (dot) characters in crate names, but the filename used contains one.

**Fix Explanation:** To fix this, rename the file to a valid crate name that does not include any dots.

Here is the corrected code:

```rust
fn compare(a: &str, b: &str) {
    println!("{:?} is of type {:?} and {:?} is of type {:?}", a, a.type_id(), b, b.type_id());

    if a <  b {      println!("{:?} is strictly less than {:?}", a, b)}
    if a <= b {      println!("{:?} is less than or equal to {:?}", a, b)}
    if a >  b {      println!("{:?} is strictly greater than {:?}", a, b)}
    if a >= b {      println!("{:?} is greater than or equal to {:?}", a, b)}

    // Case sensitive comparison
    if a == b {      println!("{:?} is case-sensitive equal to {:?}", a, b)}
    if a != b {      println!("{:?} is not case-sensitive equal to {:?}", a, b)}

    // Case insensitive comparison using .eq_ignore_ascii_case()
    let lower_a = a.to_lowercase();
    let lower_b = b.to_lowercase();

    if lower_a == lower_b {  
        println!("{:?} is case-insensitive equal to {:?}", a, b) 
    }
    if lower_a != lower_b {
        println!("{:?} is not case-insensitive equal to {:?}", a, b)
    }

    // Comparing numeric strings
    match (a.parse::<i32>(), b.parse::<i32>()) {
        (Ok(a_num), Ok(b_num)) => {
            if a_num <  b_num {      println!("{:?} is strictly less than {:?}", a, b)}
            if a_num <= b_num {      println!("{:?} is less than or equal to {:?}", a, b)}
            if a_num >  b_num {      println!("{:?} is strictly greater than {:?}", a, b)}
            if a_num >= b_num {      println!("{:?} is greater than or equal to {:?}", a, b)}
        },
        _ => println!("Both strings cannot be parsed into numeric form"),
    }
}

fn main() {
    compare("YUP", "YUP");
    compare("BALL", "BELL");
    compare("24", "123");
}
```

**Note:** The error was corrected by renaming the file to a valid crate name without any dots. The code provided above is already correct and does not contain any errors.
