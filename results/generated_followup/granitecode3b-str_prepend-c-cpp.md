Error:
- The `#include` directive is not recognized in C++ as it is in C. To fix this, simply remove the `#include` directive from the code.
- The `using namespace std;` statement is also not recognized in C++. To fix this, remove the entire `using namespace std;` statement from the code.
- The `string` class is a part of the C++ standard library and must be included using the angle brackets `<>` instead of the header file notation `#include`. To fix this, change all instances of `string` to `std::string`.
- The error messages indicate that there are undefined identifiers such as `cout` and `endl`. These identifiers are part of the C++ standard library and must be included using the angle brackets `<>` or by prepending `std::` before the identifier. To fix this, add `#include <iostream>` at the beginning of the code or add `using namespace std;` to import all necessary identifiers.
Fix:
- The error messages indicate that the `cout` and `endl` identifiers are not recognized in C++. To fix this, add `#include <iostream>` at the beginning of the code or add `using namespace std;` to import all necessary identifiers.
Code:
```cpp
#include
using namespace std;
int main() {
  string str = "my String";
  string cstr = "Changed ";
  string dup = str;
  str = cstr + dup;
  cout << str << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
