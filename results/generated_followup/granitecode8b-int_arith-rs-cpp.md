The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the headers for the standard library.
Once we have included these headers, we can compile and run the code without any errors. Here is the corrected code in a single fenced code block:
```cpp
#include
#include
#include
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc != 3) {
    std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " a b" << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  int a = std::stoi(argv[1]);
  int b = std::stoi(argv[2]);

  std::cout << "sum:              " << a + b << std::endl;
  std::cout << "difference:       " << a - b << std::endl;
  std::cout << "product:          " << a * b << std::endl;
  std::cout << "integer quotient: " << (a / b)
            << std::endl; // truncates towards zero
  std::cout << "remainder:        " << (a % b)
            << std::endl; // same sign as first operand

  return 0;
}
```
