The error is caused by an unexpected closing parenthesis `)` at the end of the statement, while trying to define multiple variables in the same line. 

To fix this issue, we need to define each variable on a separate line, and assign them values one-by-one after initializing them with some default values.

Here is the corrected code enclosed in backticks:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	original := "Mary had a X lamb."
	toBeReplaced := "X"
	replacement := "little"

	newString := original
	index := -1
	for {
		if strings.Contains(newString, toBeReplaced) {
			index = strings.Index(newString, toBeReplaced))
			break
		}
		toBeReplaced = replacement
	}

	newString = newString[:index+len(toBeReplaced)] + replacement + newString[index+len(toBeReplaced):]]
	
	fmt.Printf("String after replacement: %s\n", newString))
}
```
This corrected code uses the `strings.Index` function to find the index of the pattern in the original string. Then, it replaces the found pattern with the specified replacement string using a simple concatenation operation. Finally, it prints out the modified string after replacement.
