The error is due to the fact that there's no `main()` function in the provided C++ code snippet, which is the entry point of any C++ program.

To fix this issue we need to add a main function where our logic function can be called:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void logic(bool a, bool b) {
  std::cout << "a AND b: " << std::boolalpha << (a && b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a OR b: " << std::boolalpha << (a || b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "NOT a: " << std::boolalpha << !a << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    logic(true, false); // replace true and false with the actual values you need.
                        // this is just an example to test if it's working as expected
  return 0;   
}
```
