In Java, there is no direct equivalent to Rust's `printf()` function for string interpolation or placeholder replacement with variables. However, one can use different methods to accomplish similar tasks:

1. You can use the `String.format()` method which allows you to insert variables directly in place of placeholders.
2. Alternatively, you can use the `printf()` function with a format string which allows you to include variables directly in place of placeholders.
3. You could also use StringBuilder or StringBuffer for constructing and modifying strings dynamically. This is more about control over your output than about string interpolation, but it's one of the many ways to accomplish the same task.
4. If you want to replace placeholders with variables in your printf format string, you would need to manually iterate over your variables and format each separately.
5. If you want more control over the formatting of your output than printf provides, or if you want to take advantage of additional language features such as String interpolation or templating engines, you might want to look into libraries that provide these features. These include Java's own `String.format()` and its many variants (such as Joda-Time's `DateTimeFormat`) but also the Groovy and Scala programming languages.
