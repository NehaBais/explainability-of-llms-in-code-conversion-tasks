 The error is because C does not support named placeholders (like `name` or `adj`) in string formatting, so we need to use numbers (0 and 1) instead of "name" and "adj". 

The corrected code would look like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define STRINGIFY2(a, b) a##b
#define STRINGIFY(a) STRINGIFY2(a, _)

int main() {
  printf("Mary had a %s lamb\n", "little");

  // You can specify order
  printf("%s had a %s lamb\n", "Mary", "little");

  // Or numbers if you prefer
  printf(STRINGIFY(0) " had a %s lamb\n", "little");
  return 0;
}
```
In this code, STRINGIFY2 concatenates two string fragments and STRINGIFY expands the macro name to the stringified form of the variable. The underscore ("_") is a dummy argument used in order to keep the syntax of the macro valid, as it needs at least one argument to work with the ## operator.
