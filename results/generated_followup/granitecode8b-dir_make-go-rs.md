The error is that the `main` function is not found, which is because the code is missing the `fn main() { ... }` declaration at the end of the file. The fix is to add this declaration at the end of the file.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
use std::fs;
fn mkdir_p(path: &str) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
 fs::create_dir_all(path)?;
 Ok(())
}
fn main() {}
```
Note that the `main` function is empty in this case, as it's not necessary for a Rust program that only contains one function.
