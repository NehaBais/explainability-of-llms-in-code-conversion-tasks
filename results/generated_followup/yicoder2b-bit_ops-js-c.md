The error was due to the misuse of the right shift operator (>>) in C, which does not have the same behavior as JavaScript's logical right shift operator (>>>). In JavaScript, this operation is equivalent to unsigned right shift, while in C it simply performs a right shift operation without changing the sign.

To fix this error, you can use the unsigned right shift operator `>>` in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void bitwise(int a, int b) {
  // Perform Bitwise AND operation
  printf("a & b: %d\n", a & b);

  // Perform Bitwise OR operation
  printf("a | b: %d\n", a | b);

  // Perform Bitwise XOR operation
  printf("a ^ b: %d\n", a ^ b);

  // Perform Bitwise NOT on integer 'a'
  printf("~a: %d\n", ~a);

  // Left shift operation of first integer with number of bits of second integer
  printf("a << b: %d\n", a << b); // equivalent to left shift

  // Right shift operation on the first integer with number of bits of second
  // integer
  printf("a >> b: %d\n", a >> b); 

  // Arithmetic right shift operation on the first integer with number of bits
  // of second integer
  printf("a >>> b: %u\n", (unsigned int)a >> b); // equivalent to unsigned right shift in C
}
```
The `%u` is used for unsigned output. Replace it with `%d` if you want signed numbers.
