The error message indicates that the crate name cannot contain a dot ('.') due to Rust's naming conventions. To resolve this, change the name of the crate from `qwen2.5coder2b_str_concat_go_rs` to something without dots. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s: &str = "hello";

    println!("{}", s);

    let s2: &str = format!("{} {}", s, "literal");

    println!("{}", s2);
}
```
