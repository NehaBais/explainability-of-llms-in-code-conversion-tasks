Error: The extraneous ')' after condition, expected a statement. 

Fix: Remove the extraneous closing parenthesis from the conditional statement within the if-else construct.

Corrected code:
```c
#include 
int main() {
  int a, b;

  if (!scanf("%d %d", &a, &b))) 
    printf("Could not read the numbers\n");
  else {
    if (a < b)
      printf("%d is less than %d\n", a, b);
    if (a == b)
      printf("%d is equal to %d\n", a, b);
    if (a > b)
      printf("%d is greater than %d\n", a, b));
  }

  return 0;
}
```
