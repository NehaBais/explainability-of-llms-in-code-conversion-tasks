 The error is caused by the fact that C requires explicit declaration for functions being used before they are called, but JavaScript does not require this explicit declaration as it infers them automatically. 

To fix this issue in C, you need to include <string.h> header file which has the function prototypes for strcpy and strcat. You can do this by adding "#include<string.h>" at the top of your code like so:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h> // Include string.h here
#define SIZE 50

int main() {
  char s[SIZE] = "hello";
  char concat[SIZE];

  strcpy(concat, s); // Use the function prototype provided in string.h
  strcat(concat, " there!");

  printf("Original string: %s\n", s);
  printf("Concatenated string: %s\n", concat);

  return 0;
}
```
