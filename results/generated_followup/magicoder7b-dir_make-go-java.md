 The error "/tmp/None.java:3: error: implicitly declared classes are a preview feature and are disabled by default." occurs when you use the `Path` type in Java without enabling preview features. 

To fix this, enable preview features while compiling your java code.

Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```java
import java.nio.file.*;

public void mkdirAll(Path path, int permissions) throws IOException {
    Files.createDirectories(path);
}
```
