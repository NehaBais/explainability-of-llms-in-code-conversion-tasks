The error is due to the fact that there's no main function, which is the entry point for any C++ program.
To fix this error, we must add a `main` function where control enters and exits from:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void logic(bool a, bool b) {
  cout << "a and b: " << (a && b) << endl;
  cout << "a or b: " << (a || b) << endl;
  cout << "not a: " << !a << endl;
}

int main() {
    logic(true, false); // replace with your desired inputs.
    return 0;
}
```
