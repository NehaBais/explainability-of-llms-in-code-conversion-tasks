The error occurs because the `current_path` variable is of type `PathBuf`, but the `join()` method requires a reference to a `Path` object. The fix is to change `current_path` to be a reference by adding a `&` before it in the `join()` method call.

```rs
let mut current_path = Path::new("");

while let Some(component) = components.next() {
    current_path = &current_path.join(component);
    if !current_path.exists() {
        fs::create_dir_all(&current_path).unwrap();
    }
}
```
