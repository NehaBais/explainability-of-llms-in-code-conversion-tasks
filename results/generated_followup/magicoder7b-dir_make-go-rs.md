 The error is caused by Rust's requirement that all compiled programs include a `main` function, which defines the entry point of a program. When you compile and run this code, it does not have a main function so it fails to compile with an error E0601 - "function not found".

To fix this issue, you need to define a `main` function. Here's how you can do that:
```rs
use std::fs;
use std::io;

pub fn make_dir(dir_path: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
    fs::create_dir_all(dir_path)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    match make_dir("/tmp/some/path/to/dir") {
        Ok(_) => println!("Directory created successfully"),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}
```
In this solution, the `main` function is defined to call the `make_dir()` function and handle its return value. If `make_dir()` succeeds it prints "Directory created successfully". If it fails, it will print out the error message.
