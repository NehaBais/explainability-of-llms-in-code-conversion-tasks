Error: Use of undeclared identifier 'cout', 'cin' or '<FILENAME>'
Fix: Replace '#include' with 'iostream'.
Corrected code:
```cpp
#include
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b;
  cout << "Enter two integers: ";
  cin >> a >> b;
  if (a < b) {
    cout << a << " is less than " << b << endl;
  } else if (a == b) {
    cout << a << " equals " << b << endl;
  } else {
    cout << a << " is greater than " << b << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find certain identifiers, such as 'cout', 'cin' or '<FILENAME>', which are required for the code to compile. To fix this issue, the correct identifier needs to be added in place of the '#include' statement. In C++, the standard input/output library is included using the `<iostream>` header file, so instead of directly including it with '#include', we use the 'iostream' alias for it. This ensures that the compiler can find the required identifiers and resolve any errors.
