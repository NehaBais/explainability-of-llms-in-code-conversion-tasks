The error is that the compiler cannot find the `string` type because it is not included in the code. To fix this, add `#include  to the top of the file. The corrected code is as follows:
```
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
 string stringA = "tacoloco";
 string stringB = "co";
 return 0;
}
```
