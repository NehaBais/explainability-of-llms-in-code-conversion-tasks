The error "`main` function not found in crate `yicoder9b_logic_ops_java_rs`" indicates that a Rust program must have a `main` function. The code you provided is missing the `main` function, which is necessary for running the code in a Rust environment.

The fix to this error involves defining a `main` function that will call your `logic` function with some inputs. 

Here's how you can correct the code:
```rs
fn main() {
    logic(true, false);
}

fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
```
