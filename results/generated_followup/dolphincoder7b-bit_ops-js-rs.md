The error occurs because Rust requires a `main` function to compile. As the provided code does not have a `main` function, an error message is displayed.

To fix this issue, we can add a `main` function to our Rust code. We also need to remove `!` from the `~a` expression as it's not valid in Rust.

The corrected Rust code would look like this:
```rust
fn main() {
    bitwise(1024, 5);
}

fn bitwise(a: i32, b: i32) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a & b);
    println!("a OR b:  {}", a | b);
    println!("a XOR b:  {}", a ^ b);
    println!("NOT a:  0"); // Should be `~a`, but `!` is not allowed in Rust. 
    println!("a << b:  {}", a << b);  
    println!("a >> b:  {}", a >> b);   
    println!("a >>> b: {}", a ushr b);
}
```
