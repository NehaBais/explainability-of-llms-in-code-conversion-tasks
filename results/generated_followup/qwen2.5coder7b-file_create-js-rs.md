The error occurs because the crate name contains an invalid character `'.'`. Rust crate names cannot contain dots.

To fix this, rename the directory or file containing the Rust program to avoid using dots in the name.

Here is the corrected code:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    fs::write("output.txt", "")?;
    fs::write("/output.txt", "")?;
    fs::create_dir("docs")?;
    fs::create_dir("/docs")?;
    Ok(())
}
```

This code will create the required files and directories without any errors.
