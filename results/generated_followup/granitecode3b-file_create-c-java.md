The error in the original C code is that `java.nio.file.Files` cannot be converted to an instance of `AutoCloseable`. The reason for this error is that `java.nio.file.Files` does not implement the `AutoCloseable` interface, which is required by the try-with-resources statement.
To fix this error, we can replace the line where the exception is thrown with a regular try-catch block instead of a try-with-resources statement. Here's the corrected code:
```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileCreator {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create an empty file called "output.txt" in the current working directory
    try {
      java.nio.file.Files.createFile(new File("output.txt").toPath());
    } catch (IOException e) {
      System.err.println("Error creating output.txt: " + e);
    }

    // Create an empty directory called "docs" in the filesystem root
    try {
      java.nio.file.Files.createDirectory(new File("/docs").toPath());
    } catch (IOException e) {
      System.err.println("Error creating /docs: " + e);
    }
  }
}
``` 
The corrected code uses a regular try-catch block to handle the exceptions thrown by `java.nio.file.Files`. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.
