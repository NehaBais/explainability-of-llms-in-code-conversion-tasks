The error message is indicating that there is an indentation error on line 2 of the code, specifically with respect to the assignment statement for the variable `s`. In Python, indentation is used to denote blocks of code within a function or other code structure, and it is important to use the correct amount of whitespace before each line of code.

To fix the error, we need to make sure that all lines of code are properly indented with the same number of spaces as the previous line. In this case, the assignment statement for `s` should be indented with the same number of spaces as the `print()` function call on the previous line. Here is the corrected code:
```py
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
s = 'hello'

# Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal.
s_plus = s + ' there!'

# Print the content of the variables
print(s)
print(s_plus)
```
