The error is due to missing dependencies for the `winsapi` crate and the unresolved import of `std::ffi::wide`. To fix this, add the necessary dependencies in the Cargo.toml file and remove the import statement. Here's the corrected code:
```rust
#[cfg(windows)]
fn windows_file_system_object() -> Result<HANDLE, IOError> {
    // Windows specific code here
}
fn get_file_size(fso: &HANDLE, filename: &str) -> Result<u64, IOError> {
    // File size retrieval code here
}
```
Note that the code provided is incomplete and does not include the necessary dependencies or platform-specific code. The solution assumes that the missing dependencies are already present in the Cargo.toml file.
