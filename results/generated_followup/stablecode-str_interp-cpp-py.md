The error is "SyntaxError: unmatched ')')". It means that there's an extra closing parenthesis at the end of the Python statement, which leads to a syntax error.

To fix it, we need to remove the extra closing parenthesis.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
original = "Mary had a X lamb."
toBeReplaced = "X"
replacement = "big"
newString = original.replace(original.find(toBeReplaced)), len(toBeReplaced), replacement)
print("String after replacement:", newString)
```

This code will replace the character sequence "X" in the string with the value of `replacement`, which is "big". The result will be printed to the console.
