The errors indicate that there is no implementation for the bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) between `i32` and `u32`. The Rust compiler is telling us that it doesn't know how to handle this situation, so it aborts the compilation process.
The fix is to cast one of the integers to an unsigned integer (`ua`) before performing the shift or rotate operations. This ensures that the bitwise operator can be applied correctly between the two types.
Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```rs
fn bitwise(a: i32, b: i32) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a & b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a | b);
    println!("a xor b: {}", a ^ b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);

    // Note: the C/C++ shift operators are not guaranteed to work if the shift count (that is, b)
    // is negative, or is greater or equal to the number of bits in the integer being shifted.
    println!("a shl b: {}", a << b); // Note: "<<" is used both for output and for left shift
    println!("a shr b: {}", a >> b); // typically arithmetic right shift, but not guaranteed

    let ua = a as u32; // Cast to unsigned integer to use logical right shift (guaranteed)
    println!("a lsr b: {}", ua >> b);

    // there are no rotation operators in Rust, but we can simulate them using the bitwise operators.
    println!("a rol b: {}", (a << b) | (ua >> (32 - b)));
    println!("a ror b: {}", (ua << b) | (a >> (32 - b)));
}
``` 
Note that in Rust, left shifts (`<<`) and right shifts (`>>`) are used for signed and unsigned integer arithmetic, respectively. Also, `rotr` is a standard library function that rotates the bits of a number to the right by a specified amount.
