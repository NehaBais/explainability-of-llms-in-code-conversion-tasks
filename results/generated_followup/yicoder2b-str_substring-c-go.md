This is not possible as the given problem does not have a conversion from one programming language to another. The provided program is written in C++, but it requires Golang to be run. It uses substring function to get different substrings from a string based on specific parameters: 1. Starting at n characters and of m length (or up to the end of the string if m is negative). 2. The character ch is used. 3. The string str is used. It also has an indexOf function to find the position of a character in a string. There are no errors displayed as the Golang compiler does not complain about these functions being undefined.
