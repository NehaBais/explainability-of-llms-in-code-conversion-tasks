The error can be summarized as "unknown type name 'fn'". This is because Rust and C++ have different syntax and language features, which causes incompatibilities in the code when converted from Rust to C++.

To fix this issue, we need to rewrite the entire code using compatible syntax and language features in C++.

Here's the corrected code in a single fenced code block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string hello = "Hello world";
    hello += "!!!!";
    std::cout << hello << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
1. We include the necessary header files for input/output, string manipulation, and the standard library.
2. In main(), we declare a string variable named hello and initialize it with the literal value "Hello world".
3. Next, we use the "+=" operator to append the string literal "!!!!" to the end of the hello string variable.
4. Finally, we print out the contents of the hello string variable using the std::cout object. We also add a newline character at the end of each line using the std::endl manipulator.

By following these steps and ensuring that the code uses compatible syntax and language features in C++, we are able to successfully convert the given Rust code to its equivalent in C++.
