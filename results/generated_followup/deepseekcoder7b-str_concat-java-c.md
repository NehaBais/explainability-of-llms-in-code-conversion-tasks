The error occurs because of incorrect syntax in C programming language, it seems the code was copied from an environment that includes Unicode characters which don't work in C programs. The corrected code is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()  {
   char s[] = "hello";  // create a string variable equal to any text value
   printf("%s\n", s);
   
   char literal[] = " literal";  // concatenate it with another string literal
   char s2[100];                 // new string variable for the resultant string
   
   int i = 0, j = 0;  // counters to iterate through both strings
   
   while (s[i] != '\0') {  // copy contents of string 's' into 's2'
       s2[j++] = s[i++];
   }
   
   i = 0;  // reset counter for string 'literal'
   
   while (literal[i] != '\0') {  // append contents of string 'literal' to 's2'
       s2[j++] = literal[i++];
   }
   
   s2[j] = '\0';  // mark end of string in 's2'
   
   printf("%s\n", s2);  // display the content of variables
   
   return 0;  // returning value 0 indicates success
}
```
