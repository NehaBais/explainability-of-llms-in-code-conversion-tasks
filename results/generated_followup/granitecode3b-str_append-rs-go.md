The error occurred because the `main` function is being redeclared in each code block. To fix this, simply remove the first `fn main()` declaration from the Rust code and add a new `func main()` declaration at the beginning of the Golang code. Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
 var hello string = "Hello world"
 fmt.Println(hello + "!!!!")
}
func main() {
 hello := "Hello world"
 hello += "!!!!"
 fmt.Println(hello)
}
``` 
This should compile without errors.
