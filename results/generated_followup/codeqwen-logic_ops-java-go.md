The error occurs because Go requires that the main function be declared inside the package main. The logic function is not included in this package, thus it can't be used as the entry point for the program.

To fix the error, we need to declare a function called `main` which calls our logic function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func logic(A bool, b bool) {
	fmt.Println("A AND b: ", A && b)
	fmt.Println("A OR b: ", A || b)
	fmt.Println("NOT a: ", !A)
}

func main() {
    logic(true, true)  // example usage
}
```
