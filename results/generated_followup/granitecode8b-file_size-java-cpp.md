The error in the converted C++ code is that it contains a syntax error in the include statements, which are represented by the `#include` directive in C++. The error message indicates that the compiler expected a filename or angle brackets enclosing a filename, but it did not find either. This could be due to a missing or misplaced quotation mark around the filename.
The fix is to ensure that the filenames are enclosed in quotation marks or angle brackets. In this case, the filenames are already enclosed in quotation marks, so there is no need to change them. However, if the filenames were not enclosed in quotation marks, they would need to be enclosed in angle brackets to indicate a system path.
Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include
#include
int main() {
  std::string filename1 = "input.txt";
  std::string filename2 = "/input.txt";

  // Current working directory
  std::ifstream fileA(filename1);
  if (fileA) {
    long size1 = fileA.tellg();
    std::cout << size1 << " B" << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cerr << "Error: Unable to open file " << filename1 << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  // File system root
  std::ifstream fileB(filename2);
  if (fileB) {
    long size2 = fileB.tellg();
    std::cout << size2 << " B" << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cerr << "Error: Unable to open file " << filename2 << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Note that the code uses the `std::ifstream` class from the C++ standard library to read a file and obtain its size. The `tellg()` member function returns the current position of the input stream, which is the file size in this case. The code then prints the size to the console. If an error occurs while opening or reading the file, the code prints an error message to the console and returns a non-zero value to indicate failure.
