The error occurs because Java does not have an equivalent to Golang's `strings.Builder` for building strings, but it offers `StringBuilder` class for this purpose. The errors are due to incorrect usage of `System.out<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>.print(sb.toString());` statement which is invalid in both languages.

The correct code would be: 
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append("foo");
        sb.append("bar");
        System.out.println(sb.toString());
    }
}
```
This code will successfully compile and run without any error because it uses the correct `StringBuilder` methods from Java standard library to append strings "foo" and "bar", and then print them out with `System.out.println()` function in idiomatic way.
