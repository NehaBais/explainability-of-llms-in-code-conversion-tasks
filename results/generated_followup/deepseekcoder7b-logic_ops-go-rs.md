The error occurs because Rust programs require an entry point (i.e., a `main` function).

To fix this issue, we need to add a `main` function that calls our existing `print_logic` function with some boolean values as inputs. 

Corrected code is:
```rs
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}

fn main() {
    print_logic(true, false);  // Call the function with some boolean values.
}
```
The `main` function here acts as an entry point of our program, and it calls the `print_logic` function that performs logical operations on two given boolean inputs. It uses true and false to demonstrate how these operations are carried out in Rust as well. 

In addition, we can add more usage by calling the print_logic with other values too. The main requirement of this exercise was done.
