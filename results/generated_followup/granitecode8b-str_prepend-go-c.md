The error message indicates that there is an issue with the syntax of the `sprintf()` function call. Specifically, it seems that the function is being called without specifying the type of the first argument (`char *`), which is required by the C standard. Additionally, there is a warning about redeclaring the `sprintf` function, which may indicate that the code is not compatible with the ISO C99 or later standards.

Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```c
char s[] = "world!";
sprintf(s, "Hello, %s", s);
```
Note that we have removed the unnecessary type declaration for the `s` variable, since it is already declared as a character array.
