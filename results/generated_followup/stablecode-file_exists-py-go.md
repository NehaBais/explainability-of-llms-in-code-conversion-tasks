The error occurs due to incorrect syntax for defining functions in Golang. In Go, function definitions are enclosed within brackets `[]` and their signature consists of the function's name followed by its parameters inside parentheses `()`. The body of a function is defined using curly braces `{}`. 

To fix this error, we need to correct the syntax for defining functions in Golang. Here is the corrected code:

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Check for the file input.txt and dir docs in the CWD
	_, err := os.Stat("input.txt")
	if os.IsNotExist(err)) {
		println("File 'input.txt' does not exist in the current working directory.")
	}

	// Check for the file input.txt and dir docs in the root ("/")) directory of the system
	_, err = os.Stat("/input.txt")
	if os.IsNotExist(err)) {
		println("File '/input.txt' does not exist in the root ('/') directory of the system." )
	}

	// Check for dir docs in the CWD
	_, err = os.Stat("docs")
	if os.IsNotExist(err)) {
		println("Directory 'docs' does not exist in the current working directory.")
	}

	// Check for file and dir existence in root ("/")) directory of the system
	_, err = os.Stat("/docs")
	if os.IsNotExist(err)) {
		println("Directory '/docs' does not exist in the root ('/') directory of the system." )
	}
}
```

This code block contains a corrected version of the Golang code provided. It checks for the existence of a file called `input.txt` and a directory called `docs` in both the current working directory (`"."`)) and the root (`"/"`)) directory of the system. The code uses the `os.Stat()` function to check for the existence of files and directories, and then prints error messages if any of the required entities do not exist.
