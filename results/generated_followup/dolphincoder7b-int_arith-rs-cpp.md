The error is because there's no such keyword as "GET". The `main` function expects two command-line arguments, but the function doesn't receive any arguments through the command line. To fix this, we can modify the `main` function to accept command-line arguments and then proceed with further operations. The modified code will look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    if (argc != 3) {
        std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <a> <b>" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    int a = std::stoi(argv[1]);
    int b = std::stoi(argv[2]);

    // Rest of the code remains the same
}
```

In this modified version, we check that `argc` is equal to 3. If not, an error message is printed using `std::cerr` and the program exits with a status code of 1. Otherwise, we proceed to parse the command-line arguments into integers using `std::stoi`. These values are then assigned to variables `a` and `b`, which can be used for further operations in the rest of the code.
