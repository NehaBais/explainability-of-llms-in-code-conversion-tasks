The error message is "fatal error: 'boost/filesystem.hpp' file not found". This means that there's no Boost library for C++. The solution is to include the necessary header files in your project, which are available through the package manager (e.g., apt-get on Linux or brew on Mac).

To fix this issue, you can modify the code to use "std::filesystem" instead of "boost::filesystem", and it should work without any issues. Here's an example of how to use std::filesystem in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream> 
#include <filesystem> 

namespace fs = std::filesystem; 

int main() { 
    const char *path  = "/tmp/some/path/to/dir"; 

    if (!fs::exists(path)) { 
        fs::create_directories(path);
    } 
    return 0; 
}
```
