The error is that the `assert()` function is not available in C. The `strstr()` function is used to search for the first string in the second string and return a pointer to the first occurrence of the second string. The `strcmp()` function is used to compare the resulting substring with the third string and print whether they match or not. The `strrchr()` function is used to find the last occurrence of the third string in the second string, which we can then compare with the third string using `strcmp()`.
To fix this error, you need to include the header file `<string.h>` and use the functions `strstr()`, `strcmp()`, and `strrchr()` instead of their equivalents in C. The `assert()` function is available in C99 and later versions of the language, so no action is needed.
Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```c
#include 
int main() {
  char s1[] = "abcd";
  char s2[] = "abab";
  char s3[] = "ab";

  // Determining if the first string starts with second string
  assert(strstr(s1, s3));
  // Determining if the first string contains the second string at any location
  printf("%d", strstr(s1, s3) != NULL);
  // Print the location of the match
  printf("Found match at pos %zu", strstr(s1, s3) - s1);
  // Determining if the first string ends with the second string
  assert(strcmp(strrchr(s2, 'b'), "ab"));

  return 0;
}
```
