The error message is indicating that the `auto` type specifier used in the `stat` variable declaration is not supported in C++14, which is the version of C++ being used by default when compiling with GCC. To fix this issue, you can replace the `auto` type specifier with the explicit type `std::filesystem::status` as follows:
```cpp
const std::filesystem::status stat = std::filesystem::status(f);
```
This will tell the compiler that the `stat` variable should be of type `std::filesystem::status`, which is a class provided by the C++ standard library for working with file system paths. The corrected code should now compile successfully.
