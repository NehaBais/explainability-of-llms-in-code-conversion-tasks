 The error message "Undefined symbols for architecture arm64: "_main", referenced from: <initial-undefines>" means that the program can't find the main function, which is usually the entry point of any C or C++ application. 

To fix this problem, make sure you've defined a main() function in your code.

The corrected code would be as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void print_logic(int a, int b) {
  printf("a and b is %d\n", (a && b));
  printf("a or b is %d\n", (a || b));
  printf("not a is %d\n", !a);
}

// New main function that will call the print_logic function.
int main(){
    print_logic(1, 0); // replace with desired values
    return 0;
}
```
