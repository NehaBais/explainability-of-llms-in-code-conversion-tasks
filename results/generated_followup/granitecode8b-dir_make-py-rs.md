The error message indicates that the Rust compiler cannot find the `Result` type in the `fs` module. The `Result` type is used to represent the result of an operation that may fail, and it is a common part of the Rust standard library. To fix this error, you need to import the `Result` type from the `std::result` module.
Here is the corrected code:
```rs
use std::fs;
use std::result::Result;
fn mkdirp(path: &str) -> Result<()> {
 fs::create_dir_all(path).map(|_| ())
}
```
In this implementation, we import the `Result` type from the `std::result` module and use it to return a `Result<(), ()>` instead of `fs::Result<()>`. The `()` type represents the success case, so we pass `()` as both the Ok value and the error value. This is because the `create_dir_all` function can only fail if there are IO errors, but we don't need to handle those errors in this case.
