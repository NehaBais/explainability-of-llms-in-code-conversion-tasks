 The provided C++ code has several issues related to namespace usage, type specification, and undeclared identifiers. Here are the errors and their fixes:

1. **Error**: `expected namespace name` - This error occurs because the `namespace fs = std::filesystem;` declaration is incorrectly placed within the function scope. It should be declared at the beginning of the file or before the code block that uses it.
2. **Error**: `'auto' type specifier is a C++11 extension [-Wc++11-extensions]`, `range-based for loop is a C++11 extension [-Wc++11-extensions]` - These warnings are due to the use of auto and range-based for loops, which are features introduced in C++11. To avoid these warnings in environments that do not support C++11 (like GCC 7.3), you should explicitly specify the type of `file`.
3. **Error**: `use of undeclared identifier 'fs'` - This error occurs because the namespace alias `fs` is not recognized within the scope where it is used. It needs to be declared globally or at least before its usage in the current scope.

Here is the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

int main() {
  const char *files[] = {"input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", "/docs"};

  for (const auto &file : files) {
    try {
      if (fs::exists(file)) {
        if (fs::is_directory(file)) {
          std::cout << file << " is a directory" << std::endl;
        } else {
          std::cout << file << " is a file" << std::endl;
        }
      } else {
        std::cout << file << " does not exist" << std::endl;
      }
    } catch (const fs::filesystem_error &e) {
      std::cerr << "Filesystem error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
  }
}
```
