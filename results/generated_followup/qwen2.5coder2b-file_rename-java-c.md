The error occurs because `chdir` is not declared as part of C99 or later standards. To compile this code, you would need to include the `<unistd.h>` header file which provides declarations for system calls like `chdir`.

Here's the corrected and rewritten code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  // Define the old and new file/directory paths
  char *old_name = "input.txt";
  char *new_name = "output.txt";

  // Define the directory paths
  char *dir_old_name = "docs";
  char *dir_new_name = "mydocs";

  // Change the current working directory to the filesystem root for testing
  if (chdir("/") != 0) {
    perror("Failed to change directory");
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }

  // Test the file renaming function
  printf("Renaming %s as %s...\n", old_name, new_name);
  if (rename(old_name, new_name)) {
    printf("%s successfully renamed as %s.\n", old_name, new_name);
  } else {
    perror("Failed to rename file");
  }

  // Change back to the original working directory
  chdir("..");

  // Test the directory renaming function
  printf("Renaming %s as %s...\n", dir_old_name, dir_new_name);
  if (rename(dir_old_name, dir_new_name)) {
    printf("%s successfully renamed as %s.\n", dir_old_name, dir_new_name);
  } else {
    perror("Failed to rename directory");
  }

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

This should compile without errors and execute the intended file and directory renaming operations.
