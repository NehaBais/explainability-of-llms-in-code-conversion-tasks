The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the declarations for `strcat` and `printf`, which are part of the C standard library. To fix this, we need to include the appropriate header files (`<string.h>` and `<stdio.h>`) at the top of the file, which declare these functions.
Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 char *str = "foo";
 char *append_str = "bar";
 strcat(str, append_str);
 printf("%s", str);
 return 0;
}
```
