The error message indicates that the code is not properly formatted as Go code, which requires a package declaration at the beginning of the file. The fix is to add a `package main` statement at the top of the file to declare the package name as "main".
Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```go
package main
func print_logic(a, b bool) {
 fmt.Println("a and b is", a && b)
 fmt.Println("a or b is", a || b)
 fmt.Println("not a is", !a)
}
```
