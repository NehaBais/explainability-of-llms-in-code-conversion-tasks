The error message indicates that there is an incompatible pointer to integer conversion when using the strstr function in C. In Golang, the pointer arithmetic of strings works as expected, but in C, this is not allowed due to stricter type checking rules. To fix this issue, we need to make a small modification.

The error occurs because the return value of strstr is treated as an integer by the compiler. We can resolve this by type-casting it to size_t before performing any arithmetic operations on it. The correct code would be:

```c
size_t start = 0;
while ((start = (size_t)strstr(first + start, second))) {
   printf("%d  ", start - first);
   if (strlen(second) > strlen(first))
     break;
   ++start;
}
```

This change allows the compiler to correctly interpret and type-cast the return value of strstr without causing an error. The modified C code should now compile successfully when run in a C environment.
