Your request appears to be incomplete or incorrect, as it doesn't detail what specific error message is being generated, nor does it provide an example of Rust code that cannot compile due to a missing type for struct stat. However, I can still help convert this Rust program to C:

The equivalent C code should look like this:
```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  char *file_name = (argc > 1) ? argv[1] : "input.txt";
  struct stat buffer;

  if (stat(file_name, &buffer) == -1) {
    perror("Error");
    return 2;
  }

  printf("Size of file.txt is %lld bytes\n", (long long int)buffer.st_size);

  return 0;
}
```
To compile this code and fix the error if it occurs:
1. Open terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to directory containing the `file_size.c` file
3. Compile the C program using the following command: `gcc -o file_size file_size.c`
4. Run the program with: `./file_size input.txt` or `./file_size` (if no arguments given)
5. If any error occurs during compilation, it will be printed to the terminal and the build process may halt.
