The error was that the Python code had an extra space after the opening quotation mark of the backticked string. This caused an `IndentationError` when Python tried to parse the code. The fix was to remove the extra space.
The corrected code in a single line is as follows:
```
print(f"Factors of {n} not computed")
```
