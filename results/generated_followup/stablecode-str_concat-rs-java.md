The error is caused by missing semicolons at the end of each line where variables are being assigned or concatenated with strings. 

To fix this, simply add a semicolon (;) after each variable assignment or concatenation operation.

Here's the corrected Java code in one single fenced code block:
```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Initialize the first string variable (s) with value "hello"
        String s = "hello";
        System.out.println("Original String: " + s));
        
        // Concatenate the original string variable (s) with another string literal (" world") and store it in a new string variable (s1).
        String s1 = s + " world";
        System.out.println("Concatenated String: " + s1));
    }
}
```
