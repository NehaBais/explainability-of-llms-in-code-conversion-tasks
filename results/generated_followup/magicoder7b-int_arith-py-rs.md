 The error is caused by trying to call `flush()` method on `io::Stdout` struct, but this method does not exist for the `Stdout` type in Rust. The correct way to flush output in Rust is by using `print!()` macro instead of `println!()`. You should also import the necessary trait (`Write`) before you call `flush()`, like so:

```rs
use std::io::{self, Write};

fn main() {
    print!("Enter first number: ");
    io::stdout().flush().unwrap();
    let mut input1 = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input1).expect("Failed to read line");
    let _input1: i32 = input1.trim().parse().unwrap();

    print!("Enter second number: ");
    io::stdout().flush().unwrap();
    let mut input2 = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input2).expect("Failed to read line");
    let _input2: i32 = input2.trim().parse().unwrap();

    // ... the rest of your program here ...
}
```
The corrected code above reads a line from standard input, trims it, parses it into an integer using `parse()`, and then stores this integer in either `_input1` or `_input2`. The `flush()` method is used to clear the standard output before reading the next line of text. This is because Rust's `print!()` macro doesn't automatically append a newline after printing, which is why we need to explicitly flush the buffer to print on the same line as the prompt.
