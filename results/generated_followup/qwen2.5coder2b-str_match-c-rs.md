The error message indicates that the crate name cannot contain a dot. In Rust, the crate name must be a valid identifier, which means it can only consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores.

To fix this, change the `crate_name` in the `Cargo.toml` file to something without dots.

```toml
[package]
name = "qwen2_5coder2b_str_match_rs"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
```

The corrected code is already provided above in the Rust section.
