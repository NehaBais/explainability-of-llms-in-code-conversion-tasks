The error occurred because Rust requires that both arguments to `replace` be slices of the same type (`&str` or `&[u8]`), not `String`. To fix this, we can modify our code as follows:

```rust
use std::string::String;
fn main()  {
    let original = String::from("Mary had a X lamb.");
    let to_be_replaced = String::from("X");
    let replacement = String::from("little");

    // Replace the first occurrence of the substring "X" with "little".
    let new_string: String  = original.replace(&to_be_replaced, &replacement);

    println!("String after replacement: {}", new_string);
}
```

Here, we replace `original.replace(to_be_replaced, replacement)` with `original.replace(&to_be_replaced, &replacement)`. This modification makes the method signature consistent with Rust's expectations, making it possible to call this method with the correct arguments.
