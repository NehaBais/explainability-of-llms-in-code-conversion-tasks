The error message is due to the fact that the `std::filesystem` library was introduced in C++17, which is not widely supported in older versions of the language. To fix this issue, you can use the Boost Filesystem library instead. Here's a single-line explanation and solution for your code conversion:

The error message is due to the fact that the `std::filesystem` library was introduced in C++17 (it is not available in earlier versions of the language). To fix this issue, you can use the Boost Filesystem library. Here's how you can rewrite the corrected code in a single code block:

```cpp
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>  // For filesystem operations (Boost 1.65+)
#include <iostream>                // For cout

int main() {
  boost::filesystem::path current_directory = boost::filesystem::current_path();
  std::cout << "input.txt is a regular file? "
            << (boost::filesystem::is_regular_file(current_directory / "input.txt")  ?  "yes" :  "no");

  std::cout  << "\ndocs is a directory? "
             << (boost::filesystem::is_directory(current_directory / "docs")  ?  "yes" :  "no");

  boost::filesystem::path root_directory = boost::filesystem::system_complete("input.txt");
  std::cout  << "\n/input.txt is a regular file? "
             << (boost::filesystem::is_regular_file(root_directory) ?  "yes" :  "no");

  std::cout  << "\n/docs is a directory? "
             << (boost::filesystem::is_directory(root_directory / "docs")  ?  "yes" :  "no");

  return 0;
}
```

In this modified code, the `std::filesystem` library is replaced by `boost::filesystem`. Additionally, to perform filesystem operations on non-standard paths (not in the current working directory or the root of the filesystem), you can use the `system_complete()` function from Boost Filesystem. This function returns a path with absolute path components if they are not already absolute.
