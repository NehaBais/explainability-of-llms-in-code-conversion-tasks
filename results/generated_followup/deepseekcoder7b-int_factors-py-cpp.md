The error message indicates that 'x' is not declared before its use in lines 13, 14, and 15 of the C++ code, which are incrementing 'x', checking if it squared equals to 'n', and pushing it back into vectors 'factors1'. This could be fixed by declaring 'x' at the beginning with a suitable initialization (i.e., `int x = 0;` instead of just `int x;`).

Here is the corrected code: 
```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> factor(int n) {
    std::vector<int> factors1, factors2;
    for (int x = 1; x <= static_cast<int>(sqrt(n)); ++x)  {
        if (n % x == 0)  {
            factors1.push_back(x);
            factors2.push_back(n / x);
        }
    }
    ++x;
    if (x * x == n) {
        factors1.push_back(x);
    }
    factors1.insert(factors1.end(), factors2.rbegin(), factors2.rend());
    return factors1;
}

int main() {
    for (const auto &i : {45, 53, 64}) {
        std::cout << i << ": factors: ";
        for (auto factor : factor(i)) {
            std::cout << factor << ' ';
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
    return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>0;
}
```
