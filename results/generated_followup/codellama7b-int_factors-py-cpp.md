Error: The C++ compiler is unable to find the "x" identifier, which is used in the for loop condition and as an iterator variable in the range-based for loop. This is likely because the "x" identifier is declared within a lambda function, and the C++ compiler does not support lambdas yet.
Fix: Replace the lambda function with a regular function, such as "int factor(int n)". This will allow the C++ compiler to find the "x" identifier and resolve the compilation error.
Corrected code:
```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

vector<int> factor(int n) {
  vector<int> factors1, factors2;
  for (int x = 1; x <= sqrt(n); ++x) {
    if (n % x == 0) {
      factors1.push_back(x);
      factors2.push_back(n / x);
    }
  }
  ++x;
  if (x * x == n) {
    factors1.push_back(x);
  }
  factors1.insert(factors1.end(), factors2.rbegin(), factors2.rend());
  return factors1;
}

int main() {
  for (auto i : {45, 53, 64}) {
    vector<int> factors = factor(i);
    cout << i << ": factors: ";
    for (auto f : factors) {
      cout << f << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
