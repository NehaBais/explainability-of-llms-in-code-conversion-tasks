 The error is occurring because Rust requires a `main` function from which the program starts execution. This isn't present in this file. In Rust, a `main` function must exist in every crate (Rust equivalent of an application or library), and it is called automatically when the binary is executed.

To fix this error, you can simply add a main function at the end of your file like so:
```rs
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("{}", format!("a and b is {}", a && b));
    println!("{}", format!("a or b is {}", a || b));
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}

fn main() {
    print_logic(true, false);
}
```
Here `main` function calls the `print_logic` with some arguments. You can change the values inside the brackets of `print_logic(true, false);` according to your need.
