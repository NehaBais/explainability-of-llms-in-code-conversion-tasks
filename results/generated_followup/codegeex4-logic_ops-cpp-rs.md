The error occurs because Rust requires a `main` function as entry point to the program, which is missing in the provided code snippet. 
To fix this, we simply need to add a `main` function that calls our `print_logic` function.
Here's how it can be done:
```rs
fn main() {
    print_logic(true, false);
}
```
This simple `main` function will call the `print_logic` function with true and false as arguments.
