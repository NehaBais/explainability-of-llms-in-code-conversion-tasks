The error message is indicating that it cannot find the `rename` method that's defined in the `System` class. This method is specific to the C++ standard library, not Java's built-in libraries. 

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that the necessary method exists within the correct Java class. In this case, we can use the `Files` utility class to achieve the desired functionality:

```java
import java.nio.file.Files;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
     // Rename  "input.txt" into  "output.txt" and  "docs" into  "mydocs", both in the current working
     // directory
    Files.move(Paths.get("input.txt"), Paths.get("output.txt"));
    Files.move(Paths.get("docs"), Paths.get("mydocs"));

     // Rename  "/input.txt" into  "/output.txt" and  "/docs" into  "/mydocs"
     Files.move(Paths.get("/input.txt"), Paths.get("/output.txt"));
     Files.move(Paths.get("/docs"), Paths.get("/mydocs"));
   }
}
```

In this updated code, we're using the `Files` utility class from Java's NIO (New Input/Output) library to perform the renaming operations instead of relying on the built-in system calls provided by C++. This approach ensures that the code works across different operating systems and is more portable.

Note: The `Paths` class was introduced in Java 7, so you'll need to add it if using an older version. It's not included in the default set of classes.
