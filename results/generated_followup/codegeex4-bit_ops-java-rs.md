The error occurred because bitwise operations cannot be performed directly between `i32` and `u32`. The fix involves casting both integers to either `i32` or `u32` before performing the operation, depending on which is required for the specific operation.

Here is the corrected code:

```rs
pub fn bitwise(a: i32, b: u32) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a & b as i32);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a | b as i32);
    println!("a XOR b: {}", a ^ b as i32);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
    println!("a << b: {}", (a as u32) << b); // left shift
    println!("a >> b: {}", a >> b); // arithmetic right shift
    println!("a >>> b: {}", (a as u32) >> b); // logical right shift
    println!("a rol b: {}", a.rotate_left(b)); // rotate left
    println!("a ror b: {}", a.rotate_right(b)); // rotate right
}
```

The error was due to Rust not supporting bitwise operations between types of different signedness (i.e., between `i32` and `u32`). The fix involves casting the second operand (`b`) to match the type of the first operand (`a`) before performing the operation.
