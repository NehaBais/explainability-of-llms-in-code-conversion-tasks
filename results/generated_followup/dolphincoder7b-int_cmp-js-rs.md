The error occurs because Rust does not allow multiple definitions of the same function without being marked as `unsafe`. The second definition of the `compare_numbers` function is shadowing the first one, preventing the compiler from compiling the code correctly. To fix this issue, you need to mark one or both functions as `unsafe`, but it's recommended to avoid using `unsafe` if possible and handle such cases in a safer way.

```rust
// Using type coercion
pub fn compare_numbers(a: i32, b: i32) {
    if a == b {
        println!("{} equals {}", a, b);
    }
    if a < b {
        println!("{} is less than {}", a, b);
    }
    if a > b {
        println!("{} is greater than {}", a, b);
    }
}

// Without using type coercion and using standards
// Written for browsers
// assumption of a and b are both integers if typeof test passes
pub fn compare_numbers(a: i32, b: i32) {
    match (a == b, a < b, a > b) {
        (true, _, _) => println!("{} equals  {}", a, b),
        (_, true, _) => println!("{} is less than {}", a, b),
        (_, false, true) => println!("{} is greater than {}", a, b),
        _ => println!(
            "{} and {} are not of the same type and cannot be compared.",
            a, b
        ),
    }
}
```
