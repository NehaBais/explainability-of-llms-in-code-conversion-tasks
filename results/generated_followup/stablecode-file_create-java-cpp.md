Error: Too many errors emitted, stopping now [-ferror-limit=]. 2 warnings and 20 errors generated.

Fix: Check the compilation settings of your compiler to ensure that it is configured to handle C++17 features correctly. Additionally, ensure that you are using a compatible version of your C++ compiler to successfully compile this code.

Corrected code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <filesystem>

int main() {
    std::filesystem::path currentDirPath(std::filesystem::current_path()));
    if (!std::filesystem::exists(currentDirPath))) {
        std::cout << "Directory does not exist." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This corrected code includes the necessary `#include` statements for using the `<iostream>` and `<filesystem>` libraries. It also includes the `main()` function, which initializes a `std::filesystem::path` object with the current directory path. It then checks if the directory exists by calling `std::filesystem::exists()` with the `currentDirPath` parameter. If the directory does not exist, it prints an error message and returns 1 from the `main()` function. Otherwise, it simply returns 0 from the `main()` function.
