 The error message `runtime.main_mainÂ·f: function main is undeclared in the main package` occurs when there isn't a main() function in the main package, which is necessary for the program to start executing. 

To fix this issue, you have to include a main function that calls your bitwise function with some example inputs. For instance:
```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "math"

func bitwise(a, b int) {
	//... code here ...
}

func main() {
    bitwise(10, 2)
}
```
In this corrected version of the program, I have included a `main()` function that calls the `bitwise()` function with example inputs.
