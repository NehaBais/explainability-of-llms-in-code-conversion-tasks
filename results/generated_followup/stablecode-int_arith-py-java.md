The error is due to an extra closing parenthesis `)` at the end of the line where it's needed most. 

Here's the fix: Remove the extra closing parenthesis `)`. 

Corrected code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) 
```
This corrected code should compile and run without any syntax errors or runtime exceptions.
