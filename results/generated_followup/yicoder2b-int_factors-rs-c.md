The error mentioned is due to mismatched types being used with square root functions in C. In Rust, we used `sqrt()` which was expecting float for input but added 1 to it which made it return integer type. But in C, the type of the result of a function like `sqrt` should be specified explicitly. So, you need to change the line `for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(num as float) + 1; ++i)` to `float i = 1.0; for (i <= sqrt(num) + 1.0; ++i)`. After making this change, your code should compile successfully and print the factors of the number in ascending order as expected.
