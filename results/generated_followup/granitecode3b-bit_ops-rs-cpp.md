The error occurred because the C++ compiler was unable to find the `iostream` library, which contains the `cout` object and other functions related to input/output operations. To fix this, we need to include the `iostream` library at the beginning of our program.
```cpp
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
  unsigned char a = 105;
  unsigned char b = 91;
  cout << "a      = " << setfill('0') << setw(8) << binary << a << endl;
  cout << "b      = " << setfill('0') << setw(8) << binary << b << endl;
  cout << "a | b  = " << setfill('0') << setw(8) << binary << (a | b) << endl;
  cout << "a & b  = " << setfill('0') << setw(8) << binary << (a & b) << endl;
}
```
The fix is to include the `iostream` library at the beginning of our program. Now, our code should compile without errors.
