The error message indicates that there are missing include statements for thestdio.h library, which provides declarations for the printf and scanf functions used in the code.
After adding the header file, the code should compile without any errors. Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```c
#include
int main() {
 int a, b;
 printf("Enter value of a: ");
 scanf("%d", &a);
 printf("Enter value of b: ");
 scanf("%d", &b);

 if (a < b) {
 printf("a is less than b");
 } else if (a > b) {
 printf("a is greater than b");
 } else if (a == b) {
 printf("a is equal to b");
 }

 return 0;
}
```
