The error message indicates that there is an ambiguity between the different implementations of the `parse` method for different integer types. To resolve this, the code needs to specify the type parameter `F` explicitly when calling the `parse` method. The corrected code is as follows:
```rs
if let (Ok(a), Ok(b)) = (a.parse::<i32>(), b.parse()) {
 // test for less-than
 if a < b {
 println!("{} is less than {}", a, b);
 }
 // test for equality
 if a == b {
 println!("{} is equal to {}", a, b);
 }
 // test for greater-than
 if a > b {
 println!("{} is greater than {}", a, b);
 }
} else {
 println!("Please enter valid integers");
}
```
This code explicitly specifies that the `parse` method should be called with type parameter `i32`. This ensures that there is no ambiguity between the different implementations of the `parse` method for different integer types. The rest of the code remains unchanged, as it already correctly handles the comparison operators and error cases.
