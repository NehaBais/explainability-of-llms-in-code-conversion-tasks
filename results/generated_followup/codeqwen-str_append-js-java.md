The error occurs because Java does not support implicitly declared classes, unlike JavaScript ES6+. The `--enable-preview` flag was introduced to enable this feature, but it is still experimental and not widely supported.

To fix the error, you need to either explicitly declare a class (using `public class HelloWorld { ... }`) or use a different approach such as creating an instance of a StringBuilder or using the `String.format()` method.

Here's the corrected code in Java:

```java
String s1 = "Hello";
s1 += ", World!";
System.out.println(s1);
```
