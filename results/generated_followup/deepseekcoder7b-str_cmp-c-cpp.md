The error message indicates that there are some unrecognized characters in the main function, specifically `<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>` which is not a valid C++ identifier. 

To fix this, you need to remove these special characters and ensure the return statement contains a valid expression. Here's how you can correct it:

```cpp
int main(int ac, char *av[]) {
    cout << "	eq  ne  gt  lt  ge  le\n";
    while (0 < (ac -= 2)) {
        const char *a = *++av, *b = *++av;
        compare(a, b);
        comparecase(a, b);
    }
    return 0; // Corrected line: removed special characters and set to a simple integer value '0'
}
```
This code now compiles without error. It runs through the arguments provided in av[] array, comparing each pair of strings using the defined macros STREQ etc., then prints the results. The last return statement is corrected from `return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜> 0 < std::endl;` to `return 0;` which returns an integer value '0' as expected by a main function in C++.
