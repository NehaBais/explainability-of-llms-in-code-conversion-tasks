The error message is indicating that the variable `newString` has an array type but does not have an explicit size or initializer. This is a requirement for all variables in C, as they must be declared with a size or initialized with a value.

To fix this issue, we can initialize `newString` with an empty string using the `strcpy` function to copy the null-terminated character array `""` into it:

char newString[1];
strcpy(newString, "");

This will create a new string with size 1 and set its value to an empty string.

Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char original[] = "Mary had a X lamb.";
  char toBeReplaced[] = "X";
  char replacement[] = "little";
  char newString[1];
  strcpy(newString, "");

  int index = strstr(original, toBeReplaced);

  if (index != -1) {
    strncpy(newString, original, index);
    strncat(newString, replacement, strlen(replacement));
    strncat(newString, original + index + 1, strlen(original) - index - 1);
  } else {
    strcpy(newString, original);
  }

  printf("String after replacement: %s\n", newString);

  return 0;
}
```
