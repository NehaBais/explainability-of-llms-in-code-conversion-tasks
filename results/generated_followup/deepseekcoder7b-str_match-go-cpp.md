The error occurs because of incorrect usage of special characters `<`, `>`, `|`, `~`, `▁`, etc., which are not allowed in C++. The correct return statement for a main function is to indicate the exit status of the program, an integer value typically between 0 and 255.

The corrected code should be:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

void match(std::string first, std::string second) {
    std::cout << "1. " << first << " starts with " << second << ": ";
    if (first.find(second) == 0)
        std::cout << "true\n";
    else
        std::cout << "false\n";

    std::size_t found = first.find(second);
    std::cout << "2. " << first << " contains " << second << ": ";
    if (found != std::string::npos)
        std::cout << "true\n";
    else
        std::cout << "false\n";

    if (found != std::string::npos) {
        std::cout << "2.1. at location " << found << ", \n";

        int i = found + 1;
        while ((found = first.find(second, i)) != std::string::npos) {
            std::cout << "2.2. at location " << found << ", ";
            // Move to next position after match
            i = found + second.length();
        }

        std::cout << "\n";
    }

    std::cout << "3. " << first << " ends with " << second << ": ";
    if (first.rfind(second) == first.length() - second.length())
        std::cout << "true\n";
    else
        std::cout << "false\n";
}

int main() {
    match("hello world", "world");
    return 0;   // Correct return statement
}
```
In the corrected code, I have removed all special characters and replaced them with their appropriate syntax. For example, `<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜ >` has been changed to `return 0;`. The function `main()` now returns a correct exit status of 0 (which signifies the program ended successfully).
