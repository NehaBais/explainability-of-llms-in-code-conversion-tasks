The error occurs because the function `printLogic` is not defined anywhere. In C++, functions are case-sensitive, so `printLogic` must be written as `print_logic`. The corrected code should look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void print_logic(int a, int b)  {
  cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << "\n";
  cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << "\n";
  cout << "not a is " << (!a) << "\n";
}

int main()  {
  print_logic(1, 0);  // Outputs: a and b is 0, a or b is 1, not a is 0
  return 0;
}
```

This code should successfully compile and produce the expected output.
