The error occurred because the JavaScript syntax does not allow for indentation at the function level. The correct way to define the `factor` function in JavaScript is as follows:

```js
function factor(n) {
    let factors1 = [];
    let factors2 = [];

    for (let x = 1; x <= Math.sqrt(n); x++) {
        if (n % x === 0) {
            factors1.push(x);
            factors2.push(n / x);
        }
    }

    const x = Math.sqrt(n);
    if (Math.pow(x, 2) === n) {
        factors1.push(x);
    }

    // reverse factors2 and append all elements of factors2 to the end of factors1
    return [...factors1, ...factors2.reverse()];
}
```

The above code defines a `factor` function which takes a single argument `n`, initializes empty arrays for storing factors (`factors1` and `factors2`). It then iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`. If a number is divisible by the current loop variable `x`, it adds that number (or its reciprocal) to `factors1` and `factors2`, respectively. After the loop, if the square of the last element in `factors1` plus 1 equals `n`, it appends this number to the end of `factors1`. Finally, it returns a new array containing all elements from `factors1` followed by all elements from `factors2` reversed.
