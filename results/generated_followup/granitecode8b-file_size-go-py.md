The error message indicates that there is an indentation issue with the `file_size = os.stat(f).st_size` line. The code is missing proper indentation for the nested if statement.
To fix this, you need to add the correct number of spaces or tabs before the `print()` statement within the nested if block.
Here's the corrected Python code:
```python
import os
def print_file_size(f):
 if os.path.exists(f):
 file_size = os.stat(f).st_size
 print(f"File size for {f}: {file_size} bytes")
 else:
 print(f"File not found: {f}")
# Test the function with a file in the current working directory and one in the file system root
print_file_size("input.txt")
print_file_size("/input.txt")
```
This should resolve the IndentationError you were encountering when running the code. The corrected code properly indents the `print()` statement within the nested if block to ensure it is executed correctly.
