The error in the given code is due to the incorrect usage of import. In Go, we use `import ""` for importing modules or specific packages. However, when using built-in packages like `os`, we use `os/os` instead. The correct version of the given JavaScript code in Golang would be:
```go
package main

import (
	"os"
)
func main() {
    fs := os.FileSystem()
	file, _ := fs.Open("input.txt")
	if file != nil {
		println("File exists in current working directory")
	} else {
		println("File doesn't exist in current working directory")
	}
	file, _ := fs.Open("c:\\input.txt")
	if file != nil {
		println("File exists at c:/ in current working directory")
	} else {
		println("File doesn't exist at c:/ in current working directory")
	}
	folder, _ := fs.Open("docs")
	if folder != nil {
		println("Folder exists in current working directory")
	} else {
		println("Folder doesn't exist in current working directory")
	}
	folder, _ := fs.Open("c:\\docs")
	if folder != nil {
		println("Folder exists at c:/ in current working directory")
	} else {
		println("Folder doesn't exist at c:/ in current working directory")
	}
}
```
The given Go code checks if the file and directories "input.txt" and "docs" exist in both the current working directory (cwd), as well as in the filesystem root. If they do, it prints a corresponding message; otherwise, it prints an error message.
