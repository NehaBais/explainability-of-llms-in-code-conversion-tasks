The error in this case is related to macro parsing issues in Rust. To fix this, we can use the correct syntax for defining a function or struct inside another function:

```rs
fn compare_strings(a: &str, b: &str) {
    match a.cmp(b) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("{} is strictly less than {}", a, b),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("{} is equal to {}", a, b),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("{} is strictly greater than {}", a, b),
    }
}

compare_strings("YUP", "YUP");
compare_strings("BALL", "BELL");
compare_strings("24", "123");
```

The fix in this case was to correctly define the `compare_strings` function inside another function. This corrected code should now compile successfully and produce the desired string comparison results.
