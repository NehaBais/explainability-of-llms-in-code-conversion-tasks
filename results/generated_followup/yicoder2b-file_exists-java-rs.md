The error you are seeing is due to the fact that the compiler cannot determine which module `java.io` or `fs` corresponds with Rust, since they are different modules in both languages. To fix this issue, you can add a statement at the top of your Rust file to specify that the module belongs to std (the standard library).
Now when you import `java.io` or `fs`, they will correctly refer to their counterparts in Rust's standard library, which is `std`. Here is how your revised code looks:

```rs
import std::io::File;

fn main() {
    let file = File::exists("docs/input.txt"); // Checking for current working directory 
    let file = File::exists("/docs/input.txt");  // Same but for root directory
}
```
