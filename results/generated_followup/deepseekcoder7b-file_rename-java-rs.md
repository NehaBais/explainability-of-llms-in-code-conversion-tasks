The errors are due to incorrect types being passed to the `test` function, which expects string slice (&str) as arguments but strings (String) were provided instead. The second error is related to a missing method call for PathBuf on display and the first argument of format! macro can only take &str as parameter not String.

The fix would be to use `display` or `to_string_lossy` methods on each of them, and change format! arguments from type String to &str. 

Here is the corrected code:
```rs
use std::env;
use std::fs;
use std::io::Error;

fn rename_file(old_path: &str, new_path: &str) -> Result<(), Error> {
    fs::rename(old_path, new_path)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn test(type_: &str, old_name: &str, new_name: &str) {
    match rename_file(old_name, new_name) {
        Ok(_) => println!("The following {} called {} was renamed as {}.", type_, old_name, new_name),
        Err(e) => println!("{} could not be renamed into {} because of: {}", old_name, new_name, e),
    };
}

fn main() {
    let current_dir = env::current_dir().unwrap();
    let root_path = "/";  // On Unix-based systems. Change it according to your OS

    test("file", &format!["/{}{}", current_dir.display(), "input.txt"], "output.txt");
    test(
        "directory",
        &format!["/{}{}", root_path, "docs"],
        "mydocs",
    );
}
```
This should fix the type mismatch errors and provide expected behavior for your use case.
