 The error message indicates that there is no member named 'filesystem' within the std namespace, which is true. In C++, filesystem features are provided by the `<filesystem>` header file, but this feature was added in C++17 and therefore not available before it.

Fix: Ensure your compiler supports C++17 or later to have access to `<filesystem>` functions. If you're using a version of C++ older than 17, consider upgrading your compiler or use an alternative method like Boost filesystem library if you are not allowed to upgrade the compiler version.

Corrected Code:
```cpp
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Size of 'input.txt' in the current directory: "
              << std::filesystem::file_size("input.txt") << '\n';

    std::cout << "Size of '/input.txt' in the root file system: "
              << std::filesystem::file_size("/input.txt") << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
