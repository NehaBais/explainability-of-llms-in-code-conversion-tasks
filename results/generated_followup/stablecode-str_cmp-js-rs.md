The error in this case is that Rust does not support multiple return types for a function. The function `comparison_test` is trying to return more than one value as part of a tuple, which is not allowed in Rust.

To fix this issue, the function `comparison_test` should be modified so that it only returns a single value or type.

Here is the corrected code:

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("{:?}", comparison_test()));
}

struct ComparisonTest;

impl ComparisonTest {
    // Demonstrating equal values with exact type equality 
    fn exact_type_equal(&self) -> bool {
        "abcd" == "abcd"
    }

    // Demonstrating not equal values 
    fn not_equal_values(&self) -> bool {
        "ABCD" != "abcd"
    }

    // Demonstrating lexical ordering before 
    fn lexically_ordered_before(&self) -> bool {
        "abcd" < "dcba"
    }

    // Demonstrating lexical ordering after 
    fn lexically_ordered_after(&self) -> bool {
        "abcd" > "dcba"
    }

    // Demonstrating case insensitive comparison 
    fn case_insensitive_comparison(&self) -> bool {
        "ABCD".to_lowercase() ==  "abcd".to_lowercase()
    }
}

fn comparison_test() -> (bool, bool, bool, bool, bool)> {
    (
        ComparisonTest::exact_type_equal(), 
        ComparisonTest::not_equal_values(), 
        ComparisonTest::lexically_ordered_before(), 
        ComparisonTest::lexically_ordered_after(), 
        ComparisonTest::case_insensitive_comparison()
    )
}
```

This code provides a suite of comparison functions, each testing one aspect of string comparison in Rust. These include equal values with exact type equality, not equal values, lexical ordering before and after, case insensitive comparison, and the ability to perform multiple comparisons within a single function call.

The corrected code is written using Rust syntax and provides all the required functionality for demonstration purposes.
