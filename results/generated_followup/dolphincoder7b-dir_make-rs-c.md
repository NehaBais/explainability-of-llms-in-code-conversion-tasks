The error occurs because Rust's `main` function is not supported in standard C, which is why we need to use an alternative entry point. However, since this particular task doesn't require any specific logic inside the main function, we can just remove it and replace its content with a simple function call at the beginning of our code.

To fix the error, we'll also remove the line that includes `expect("An Error Occured!")`. These are not necessary for this task since we already have a function to create directories with creation.

Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main()  {
    return mkdir_with_creation("./path/to/dir");
}

bool mkdir_with_creation(const char *path)  {
  if (access(path, F_OK) == -1) {
    return mkdir(path, 0777);
   } else  {
    return true;
   }
}
```
