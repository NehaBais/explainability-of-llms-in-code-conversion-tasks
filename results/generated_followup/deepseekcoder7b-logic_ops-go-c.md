The error occurred because there is no `_main` function present in our C program, which is required by default for any executable C code to compile successfully. 

The fix would be to define a main function that calls the printLogic function with some sample values.

Corrected Code:
```c
#include <stdio.<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>h

// function for logical AND operation
int And(int a, int b) { return a && b; }

// function for logical OR operation
int Or(int a, int b)  { return a || b; }

// function for logical NOT operation on single boolean (integer here as C
// doesn't have bool type)
int Not(int a)        { return !a; }

void printLogic(int a, int b) {
    printf("a and b is %d\n", And(a, b));
    printf("a or b is %d\n", Or(a, b));
    printf("not a is %d\n", Not(a));
}

int main() {
  int a = 1;
  int b = 0;
  
  printLogic(a,b);
  
  return 0;
}
```
This corrected code now compiles successfully with the same logic as before. The only difference is that it includes a `main` function to call `printLogic()` and run our C program.
