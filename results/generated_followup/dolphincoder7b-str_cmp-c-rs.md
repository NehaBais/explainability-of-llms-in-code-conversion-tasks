The error occurs because Rust requires all programs to have a `main` function. In this case, the C version of the program does not have one, which is why the Rust compiler cannot find it.

To fix the issue, we need to add a main function that simply calls other functions from the C program. Here's how you can do it:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = "hello";
    let s2 = "world";

    compare_strings(s1, s2); // calling our comparison function
}
```

Now, this code will compile and run successfully.
