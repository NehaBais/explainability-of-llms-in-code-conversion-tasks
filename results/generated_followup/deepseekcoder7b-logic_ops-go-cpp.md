The error occurred because there is no `main` function in provided C++ code. In C++, every program must have a main() function to execute from where control will start executing the program. 

To fix this issue, you need to add a basic structure for your program in main function as follows:

```cpp
int main() {
    printLogic(true, false);
    return 0;
}
```

This is how corrected code would look like -

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printLogic(bool a, bool b) {
  cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << endl;
  cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << endl;
  cout << "not a is " << (!a) << endl;
}

int main() {
    printLogic(true, false);
    return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>0
