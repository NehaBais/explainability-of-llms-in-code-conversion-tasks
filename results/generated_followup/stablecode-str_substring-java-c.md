Error: 3 errors generated.

Fix: The error occurs because there are missing header files for functions like malloc, memcpy, etc. In C programming, we need to include these header files before using their functions. To fix this issue, add the following header files at the beginning of your code:
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
```
Explanation: The error occurs because some library functions like malloc are not declared in our code. To fix this issue, we need to declare these functions before using them. By adding the required header files at the beginning of our code, we can ensure that all necessary declarations for library functions are included in our code.
