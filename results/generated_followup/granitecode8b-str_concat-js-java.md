The error is due to the use of preview features in Java 17, which are not enabled by default. To fix this, we need to enable the preview features using the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling the code. The corrected code is as follows:
```java
String s = "hello";
System.out.println(s + " there!");
```
Make sure to compile the code with the `--enable-preview` flag to enable the use of preview features.
