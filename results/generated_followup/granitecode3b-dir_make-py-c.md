Error: "Undefined symbols for architecture arm64: _main, referenced from: <initial-undefines>"
Fix: Add -lm flag to the compilation command
Corrected code:
```c
#include 
#include 
#include 
int mkdirp(const char *path) {
  struct stat st;
  if (stat(path, &st) != 0) {
    mkdir(path, S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH);
  }
  return 0;
}
int main() {
  mkdirp("./path/to/dir");
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error message indicates that the linker is unable to find the symbols `_main` and `<initial-undefines>` for the architecture `arm64`. This is because the C code is trying to use functions like `mkdir()` which are not available on Unix-like systems. To fix this, we need to add the `-lm` flag to the compilation command, which links against the math library.
