 The error indicates that the `math` package is imported but not used within the Go file, which is considered as an unused import. This can be fixed by removing or commenting out the unused import. Here's the corrected code in a single code block:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Function to compute factors of a positive integer
func factor(n int) []int {
	factors := []int{}
	for x := 1; x*x <= n; x++ {
		if n%x == 0 {
			factors = append(factors, x)
			if x != n/x {
				factors = append(factors, n/x)
			}
		}
	}
	return factors
}

func main() {
	for _, i := range []int{45, 53, 64} {
		fmt.Printf("%d: factors: %v\n", i, factor(i))
	}
}
```
