The error occurred because the code was compiled with an old version of the compiler, which does not support implicit function declarations for C99-style printf. To fix this, you need to include the header file <stdio.h> or explicitly provide a declaration for printf. The warnings and errors were generated because there are undefined identifiers (int16_t) and undefined functions (printf), as well as missing terminating quotes in some of the string literals.
Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include 
int main() {
 int16_t a = -460;
 int16_t b = 6;
 printf("a:   %016b\n", (uint16_t)a);
 printf("b:   %016b\n", (uint16_t)b);
 return 0;
}
```
