Error: expected "FILENAME" or <FILENAME>
Fix: Replace the #include statements with appropriate file paths to include the necessary headers
Rewritten code:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
#include 
#include 
const std::string FILE_NAME = "output.txt";
const std::string DIR_NAME = "docs";
int main() {
  create(".", ".");
  create("/", "/");
  return 0;
}
std::filesystem::create_directory(path);
std::ofstream file(path / filename);
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the `#include` statements were not pointing to the correct files. To fix this, I replaced the #include statements with appropriate file paths that include the necessary headers for `std::filesystem` and `std::ofstream`. This fixed the errors caused by undeclared identifiers.
