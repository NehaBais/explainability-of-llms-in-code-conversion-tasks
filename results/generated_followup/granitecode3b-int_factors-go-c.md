Error: Expected "FILENAME" or <FILENAME>
Fix: Add .c extension to the file name
Corrected Code:
```c
#include 
int64_t nr;
int main() {
 printf("Enter a positive integer: ");
 scanf("%" SCNd64, &nr);
 if (nr < 1) {
 return 0;
 }
 for (int i = 2, e = 0; nr % 2 == 0; i *= 2, e++) {
 }
 void (*apf)(int64_t, int) = NULL;
 if (e > 0) {
 apf = &printFactor;
 }
 for (int d = 3, e = 0; d * d <= nr; d += 2) {
 while (nr % d == 0) {
 fs[0] = d;
 break;
 }
 }
 return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the code was not compiled with the C compiler, and it contained a function called `main`. The file extension `.c` was not specified for the file name, which caused the compiler to try to compile it as a C program, but encountered errors. The fix is to add the `.c` extension to the file name before compiling it with the C compiler.
