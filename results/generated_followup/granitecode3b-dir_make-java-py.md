The error in the Python code is that the `try/except` statement is not indented correctly. The exception handling code should be indented after the `try` statement, but it is not.
The fix for this error is to indent the exception handling code by four spaces. 
Here's the corrected code:
```py
import os
def mkdirp(path):
 try:
 os.makedirs(path)
 except OSError as exc: # Python >2.5
 if exc.errno == errno.EEXIST and os.path.isdir(path):
 pass
 else: raise
```
The corrected code should work correctly, but it is not tested because the `mkdir` function in Python does not throw an exception when a directory already exists. So, it might not work as expected on some systems.
