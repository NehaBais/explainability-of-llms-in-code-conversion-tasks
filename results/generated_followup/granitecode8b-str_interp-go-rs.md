The error is occurring because the `format!` macro in Rust requires string literals as its arguments. In this case, we are passing in two variables (`str` and `txt`) instead of a single string literal. To fix this, we need to enclose both variables in string literals so that they are treated as strings when passed to the `format!` macro.
The corrected code is:
```rs
fn main() {
    let str = "Mary had a {} lamb";
    let txt = "little";
    let out = format!("{} {}", str, txt);
    println!("{}", out);
}
```
In this updated code, we enclose both `str` and `txt` in string literals so that they are treated as strings when passed to the `format!` macro. The resulting string is then printed using `println!`.
