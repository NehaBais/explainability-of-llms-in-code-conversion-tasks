The error message `runtime.main_main·f: function main is undeclared in the main package` indicates that GoLang compiler expects a function named 'main' to be declared, which does not exist in this case. This happens because by default Go applications start with a function named `main(){}`.

The fix for this error would be adding the mentioned main function like so:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func logic(a bool, b bool)  {
   fmt.Println("a AND b:", a && b)
   fmt.Println("a OR b: ", a || b)
   fmt<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>.rintln("NOT a: ", !a)
}
func main() {
    logic(true, false)  //example usage of function logic
}
```
The entire corrected code resides in a single fenced code block. This program defines `logic` function which takes two boolean variables and prints the results for AND, OR and NOT operations on them. Then it calls this `logic` function inside main function with some example values to demonstrate usage of logic operations. Note that Go is case-sensitive so `s` should be replaced by `fmt` in srintln statement as per standard syntax.
