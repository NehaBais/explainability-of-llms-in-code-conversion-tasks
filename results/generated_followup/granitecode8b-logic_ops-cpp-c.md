The error in the code is that it is missing the header file `stdio.h` which contains the declaration of the `printf()` function. To fix this, we need to add `#include` before the first function definition to include the header file. Additionally, there are some syntax errors in the printf statements and the missing terminating double quotes for the strings.
Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include
void print_logic(int a, int b) {
 printf("a and b is %d
", a && b);
 printf("a or b is %d
", a || b);
 printf("not a is %d
", !a);
}
```
Note that in C, the data types of the arguments passed to the `print_logic()` function need to be converted from `bool` to `int`. This is done using the ternary operator `(a ? 1 : 0)`.
