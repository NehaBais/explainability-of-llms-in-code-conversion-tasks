The error occurred because Go does not have built-in support for bitwise operations like Java, such as rotate operations. The `# command-line-arguments runtime.main_mainÂ·f: function main is undeclared in the main package` error occurs due to missing a main() function in Go. It's required in every go program.

The fix would be adding the necessary main() function. Here is the corrected code : 

```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
)
func bitwise(a int, b int){
	fmt.Println("a AND b: " + strconv.Itoa(a&b))
	fmt.Println("a OR b: "  + strconv.Itoa(a|b))
	fmt.Println("a XOR b: "  + strconv.Itoa(a^b))
	fmt.Println("NOT a: " + strconv.Itoa(^a))  //Note that for bitwise NOT in Go, we use ^ symbol instead of ~
	
	// Left shift and right arithmetic shift are same in go as compared to Java. Here is the left shift
	fmt.Println("a << b: "  + strconv.Itoa(a<<uint32(b)))  //left shift
	
	if a >= 0 {
	   fmt.Println("a >> b: " + strconv.Itoa(a>>uint32(b)))  //logical right shift
	} else {
	    fmt.Printf("Negative number %d does not support logical right shift\n", a)
        }
}
func main() {
	bitwise(5, 2)  
}
```
