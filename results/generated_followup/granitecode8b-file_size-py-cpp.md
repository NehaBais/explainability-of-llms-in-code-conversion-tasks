The error message indicates that there are multiple issues with the code. The first two errors indicate that the compiler cannot find the `std` header file, which is part of the C++ standard library. The third error indicates that the compiler cannot find the `stat` function, which is used to retrieve information about a file.
The fix for these errors is to include the necessary headers and libraries in the code. Additionally, the variable declarations for `info1` and `info2` are incorrect. They should be declared as `struct stat info1, info2;`. Finally, the function calls to `stat` need to be modified to pass the correct arguments.
Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 std::string filename1 = "input.txt";
 std::string filename2 = "/input.txt";
 struct stat info1, info2;

 if (stat(filename1.c_str(), &info1) != 0) {
 std::cerr << "Error getting file size for " << filename1 << std::endl;
 return 1;
 }

 if (stat(filename2.c_str(), &info2) != 0) {
 std::cerr << "Error getting file size for " << filename2 << std::endl;
 return 1;
 }

 std::cout << "File size for " << filename1 << ": " << info1.st_size << std::endl;
 std::cout << "File size for " << filename2 << ": " << info2.st_size << std::endl;

 return 0;
}
```
