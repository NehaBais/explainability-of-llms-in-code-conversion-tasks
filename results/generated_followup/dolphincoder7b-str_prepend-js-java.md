The error occurs because Java 14 introduced implicit class declaration as a preview feature. This means that the compiler may not be able to validate certain statements until they are fully implemented in the language. In this case, we are using the `+` operator for string concatenation which is not recognized by the compiler until JDK 14.

To fix this error, you need to enable Java 14 preview features and then use the `+=` operator instead of `+`. Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Enable implicit class declaration
--enable-preview

// Now we can use the += operator for string concatenation
String s = ", World";
s += "Hello";  // This will concatenate Hello to the end of s
System.out.println(s);
```

The output should be `Hello, World` since we are appending the string variable `s`. Also note that this code is written for Java 14 or later. If you have an older version of Java, you may need to modify it accordingly.
