The error is that the compiler cannot find the `<string>` and `<iostream>` headers because they are not included in the code. The fix is to add `#include  and `#include ` at the beginning of the file. Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include
#include
int main() {
  std::string c = "cat";
  std::string d = "dog";
  if (c == d) {
    std::cout << c << " is bytewise identical to " << d << std::endl;
  }
  if (c != d) {
    std::cout << c << " is bytewise different from " << d << std::endl;
  }
  if (c > d) {
    std::cout << c << " is lexically bytewise greater than " << d << std::endl;
  }
  if (c < d) {
    std::cout << c << " is lexically bytewise less than " << d << std::endl;
  }
  if (c >= d) {
    std::cout << c << " is lexically bytewise greater than or equal to " << d
              << std::endl;
  }
  if (c <= d) {
    std::cout << c << " is lexically bytewise less than or equal to " << d
              << std::endl;
  }
  bool eq = std::lexicographical_compare(c.begin(), c.end(), d.begin(), d.end());
  if (eq) {
    std::cout << c << " is lexically equal to " << d << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << c << " is lexically not equal to " << d << std::endl;
  }
}
```
Note that the `std::lexicographical_compare` function returns a boolean value indicating whether the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than the second string. The code then prints out whether the two strings are equal or not based on this comparison.
