**Error:** The error message indicates that there are 9 template mismatch errors, specifically when trying to compare `std::basic_string` objects with other types or containers like `std::vector`, `std::deque`, etc., using the equality operator `==`.

**Fix:** To fix these errors, ensure that the comparison is done between compatible types. If you intend to check if two strings are equal, use the `==` operator directly on the string objects.

**Corrected Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string str1 = "Hello";
    std::string str2 = "World";

    // Correct comparison of strings
    if (str1 == str2) {
        std::cout << "Strings are equal.\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Strings are not equal.\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This code correctly compares two `std::string` objects using the `==` operator, which is appropriate and will compile without errors.
