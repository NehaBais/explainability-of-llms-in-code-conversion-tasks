The error message indicates that there is an indentation error in the Python code enclosed in backticks. The error is occurring on line 3 of the code, after the `if` statement.
To fix this error, you need to indent the code correctly by adding four spaces before the `try` statement on line 4. This will ensure that the code is properly formatted and will prevent the indentation error from occurring.
Here's the corrected Python implementation of the `mkdirp` function:
```py
import os
def mkdirp(path):
 if not os.path.exists(path):
 try:
 os.makedirs(path)
 except OSError as e:
 if e.errno != os.errno.EEXIST:
 raise
```
In this corrected code, the `if` statement is indented correctly to ensure that it is properly formatted and will not cause an indentation error. Additionally, the `try-except` block has been adjusted to handle any errors that may occur during the creation process, such as file permissions or other issues.
