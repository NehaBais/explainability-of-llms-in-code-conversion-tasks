**Error Explanation:** The error occurred because the file name `qwen2.5coder7b_str_interp_go_rs` contains an invalid character (`.`) which is not allowed in crate names.

**Fix Explanation:** Rename the file to a valid name that does not contain any invalid characters like `.`, such as `qwen2_5coder7b_str_interp_go_rs`.

**Corrected Code:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let str = "Mary had a {} lamb";
    let txt = "little";
    let out = format!(str, txt);
    println!("{}", out);
}
```
