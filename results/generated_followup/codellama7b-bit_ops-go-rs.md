The error occurs because Rust does not have a variable `ub` in scope, but it is being used in the last line of the code as a shift distance for the right rotation operation. The fix is to replace `ub` with the correct name of the variable, which is `b`, so that the correct value can be passed as the shift distance.

Here's the corrected code:
```rs
fn main() {
    let a = -460;
    let b = 6;

    // Bitwise logical operations
    println!("{}", (a & b));
    println!("{}", (a | b));
    println!("{}", (a ^ b));
    println!("{}", (!a));

    // Logical shifts (unsigned left operand)
    println!("{}", (a << b));
    println!("{}", (a >> b));

    // Arithmetic shifts (signed left operand)
    println!("{}", (a << b));
    println!("{}", (a >> b));

    // Rotations
    println!("{}", ((a & !b) | (!!b)));
    println!("{}", ((a & !!b) | (b << b)));
}
```
