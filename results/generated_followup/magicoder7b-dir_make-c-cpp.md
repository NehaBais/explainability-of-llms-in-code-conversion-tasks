 The error is due to the fact that the `boost/filesystem.hpp` library was not found during the compilation process. This means that Boost library, specifically the filesystem module, was not installed in the system or the compiler could not find it. 

To fix this problem:

1) You need to install the Boost C++ libraries. For Debian-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu and its derivatives, you can install them via apt: `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`. On macOS with Homebrew, use `brew install boost`.

2) Add `-I/usr/include` or `/usr/local/include` (where Boost is installed) to the compiler flags in your build system.

Now, for the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  if (argc != 2) {
    std::cerr << "usage: " << argv[0] << " <path>\n";
    return 1;
  }
  
  boost::filesystem::path p(argv[1]);
  while (!p.empty()) {
    if (boost::filesystem::exists(p)) {
      if (!boost::filesystem::is_directory(p)) {
        std::cerr << "Could not create directory '" << argv[1]
                  << "' as a file with the same name exists.\n";
        return 1;
      }
    } else {
      boost::system::error_code ec;
      boost::filesystem::create_directories(p, ec);
      
      if (ec) {
        std::cerr << "Could not create directory '" << argv[1]
                  << "' due to the following error: " << ec.message() << "\n";
        return 1;
      }
    }
    
    p = p.parent_path();
  }
  
  std::cout << "Directory '" << argv[1] << "' was successfully created.\n";
  
  return 0;
}
```
