The error is that the compiler cannot find the header file named `iostream`, which contains the `cout` and `cin` objects used for input and output. The fix is to include the header file in the code using the `#include` directive. The corrected code reads as follows:
```cpp
#include
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b;
  cout << "Enter two integers: ";
  cin >> a >> b;

  int sum = a + b; // The result of adding 'a' and 'b' (Note: integer addition
                   // is discouraged in print statements due to confusion with
                   // string concatenation)
  int difference = a - b; // The result of subtracting 'b' from 'a'
  int product = a * b;    // The result of multiplying 'a' and 'b'
  int quotient = a / b;   // The result of dividing 'a' by 'b' (Note: 'division'
                          // does not contain the fractional result)
  int remainder = a % b;  // The remainder of dividing 'a' by 'b'

  cout << "a + b = " << sum << endl;
  cout << "a - b = " << difference << endl;
  cout << "a * b = " << product << endl;
  cout << "quotient of a / b = " << quotient << endl; // truncates towards 0
  cout << "remainder of a / b = " << remainder
       << endl; // same sign as first operand

  return 0;
}
```
The error occurred because the compiler cannot find the header file `iostream`. The fix is to include the header file in the code using the `#include` directive. This will allow the compiler to find the necessary objects for input and output.
