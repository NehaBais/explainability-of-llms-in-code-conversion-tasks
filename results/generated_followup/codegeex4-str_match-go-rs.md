The error occurs because `match` is a keyword in Rust and cannot be used as a function name. The correct fix is to escape it by prefixing it with a `r#`. 

```rs
fn r#match(first: &str, second: &str) {
    println!("1. {} starts with {}: {}", first, second, first.starts_with(second));
    let mut start = 0;
    loop {
        if let Some(i) = first[start..].find(second) {
            println!("2. {} contains {} at location {}", first, second, i + start);
            start += i + 1;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    println!("3. {} ends with {}: {}", first, second, first.ends_with(second));
}

fn main() {
    r#match("abracadabra", "abr");
}
```
