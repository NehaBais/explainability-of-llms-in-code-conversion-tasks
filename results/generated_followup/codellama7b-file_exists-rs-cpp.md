The error message is indicating that the `std::initializer_list` type is not found, which is required for range-based for loops. This is because the `std::filesystem` library was introduced in C++17, and the compiler does not support it. The fix is to use a different method of iterating over the list of files, such as using a regular loop with an index variable.

Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <filesystem>

int main() {
    std::string current_working_directory = "."; // current working directory is represented by a dot (.)
    std::string input_file_path = "input.txt"; // path to the input file relative to the current working directory
    std::string docs_dir_path = "docs"; // path to the docs directory relative to the current working directory
    std::string root_input_file_path = "/input.txt"; // path to the input file in the filesystem root
    std::string root_docs_dir_path = "/docs"; // path to the docs directory in the filesystem root

    for (size_t i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        const auto& file = {current_working_directory, input_file_path, docs_dir_path, root_input_file_path, root_docs_dir_path}[i];

        try {
            if (std::filesystem::is_directory(file)) {
                std::cout << "Directory: " << file << std::endl;
            } else {
                std::cout << "File: " << file << std::endl;
            }
        } catch (const std::exception& e) {
            std::cerr << "Exception occurred: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        }
    }
}
```
Note that the `size_t` type is used to store the index of the element in the array, and the `const auto&` type is used to avoid making unnecessary copies of the elements.
