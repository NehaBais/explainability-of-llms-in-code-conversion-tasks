This error indicates that the linker is unable to find the _main symbol which is required for executing C++ programs. This might be caused by either missing libraries or incompatibility between different versions of libraries being used.

To fix this, ensure you have a main function defined and call it correctly at the bottom of your program. The main function serves as the entry point to your program where control is transferred from where it was called to here for execution.

Here's how the code should look after fixing:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool logic(const bool &a, const bool &b) {
  std::cout << "a and b:" << (a && b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a or b:" << (a || b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "not a:" << !a << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    bool a = true, b = false;
    logic(a, b);
    return 0; // return value of main depends on the success of program.
}                              // If error occurs at any point, it will return non-zero value.
```
This code prints the boolean values of "and" and "or" operations of `bool` variables as well as the inverse (`not`) of variable `a`.

In C++, we generally write a main function to execute our program. The execution starts from here and continues till an exit statement is encountered in the program.
