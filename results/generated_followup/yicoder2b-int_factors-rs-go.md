The error is due to the fact that Go doesn't support importing multiple packages simultaneously, so we have to include all necessary packages in `package` statement. Here they are: `"fmt"` for printing output and `"math"` for mathematical operations needed in our code. To resolve this issue, insert these lines at the beginning of your Go file:

```go
// import (
// 	"fmt"
// 	"math"
// )
```
