The error "`main` function not found in crate `yicoder9b_dir_make_py_rs`" occurred because Rust requires a `main` function to run the program, but it was missing from your provided Rust code snippet. 

To fix this, you can add a main function that calls the `mkdirp` function:

```rs
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn mkdirp(path: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
    fs::create_dir_all(path)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    if let Err(e) = mkdirp("./path/to/dir") {
        println!("Error: {}", e);
    }
}
```
This code will run the `mkdirp` function with a directory path "./path/to/dir" inside the `main` function and print any error that occurs during its execution.
