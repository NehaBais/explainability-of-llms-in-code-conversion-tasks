The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the headers for `iostream` and `cmath`. To fix this, we need to include the appropriate header files for these libraries. Additionally, the code contains a few syntax errors and missing semicolons. The corrected code is shown below:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;
set factors(long n) {
 set factors;
 factors.insert(n);
 factors.insert(1L);
 for (long test = n - 1; test >= sqrt(n); test--) {
 if (n % test == 0) {
 factors.insert(test);
 factors.insert(n / test);
 }
 }
 return factors;
}
int main() {
 long n = 24;
 set result = factors(n);
 for (auto factor : result) {
 cout << factor << " ";
 }
 cout << endl;
 return 0;
}
```
In this corrected code, we have included the necessary header files for `iostream` and `cmath`. We have also fixed the syntax errors and added missing semicolons. Additionally, we have used the `set` data structure instead of the `TreeSet` data structure from Java. Finally, we have used a range-based for loop to iterate over the elements in the `result` set.
