 The error is because Rust doesn't know how to compare an integer with a string, which is why `"123" != "dcba"` works, but `123 < "abcd"` or `123 > "abcd"` doesn't work, it would require a numerical comparison.

The fix for this error is to use the appropriate type that allows for both string and numeric comparisons. In your case, you can convert your integer to a String before comparing it with another String: `"123".to_string() == "abcd"`. 

Here's how you can rewrite the corrected code in Rust:

```rs
fn main() {
    println!(
        "{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}",
        "abcd" == "abcd",
        123 == 123,
        123.to_string() == "123",
        "abcd" != "dcba",
        "abcd".to_lowercase() == "abcd".to_lowercase(),
    );
}
```
