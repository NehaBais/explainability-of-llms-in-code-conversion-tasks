The error is due to the use of `let` instead of `const`. In Rust, `let` is used to declare variables that are not meant to be modified throughout the program's execution. On the other hand, `const` is used to declare variables whose values will remain constant throughout the program's execution. Since the value of `s` is expected to change, it should be declared using `let`.
The fix is to replace `let s = String::from("hello");` with `const s: &str = "hello";`. This declares a constant string variable `s` with the value `"hello"`.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
const s: &str = "hello";
println!("{} there!", s);
```
