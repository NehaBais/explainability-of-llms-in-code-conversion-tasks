The error message indicates that there are unclosed delimiters and incorrect indentation in the Rust code snippet provided. Specifically, `s` is an unknown token and it seems like it might be a typo for `{}`. 

The fix would be to replace all instances of `s` with `}` (closing bracket). Here's how the corrected code should look:

```rs
use std::fs;
use std::io::Error;

fn file_exists(path: &str)  {
    println!("{}", path);
    
    if fs::metadata(path).is_ok()  {  
        match fs::metadata(path) { 
            Ok(meta) => {
                if meta.is_dir() {
                    println!(" is a directory");
                 } else {
                     println!(" exists with a file size of {} bytes", meta.len());
                 }},
             Err(_e)  => println!(" does not exist"),   
         };
     } else {
         println!("{} does not exist", path);  
     }
}

fn main()  {
    file_exists("input.txt");          
    file_exists("/input.txt");         
    file_exists("docs/input.txt");     
    file_exists("docs/zero_length.txt");       
}
```
This code should work as expected and correctly check if the files or directories exist in both relative to the current working directory, and absolute path of the filesystem root. Please replace "/input.txt" and "docs/zero_length.txt" with your actual file paths in root filesystem directory.
