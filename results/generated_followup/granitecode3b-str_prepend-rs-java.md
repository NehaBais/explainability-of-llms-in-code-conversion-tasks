The error occurred because Java does not support implicitly declared classes, which are required to compile the given code. To resolve this issue, we can use a `StringBuilder` class to concatenate the two strings together.
The error occurred because Java does not support implicitly declared classes, which are required to compile the given code. To resolve this issue, we can use a `StringBuilder` class to concatenate the two strings together. Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```java

 .append("World")
 .toString();
System.out.println(s);
```
