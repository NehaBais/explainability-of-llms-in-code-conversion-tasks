Error:
The Rust compiler is unable to determine the order of elements or compare two values of type `T` because it doesn't have any trait bounds defined for that type. This means that the compiler can't know how to compare or order instances of `T`, which leads to a compile-time error.

Fix:
To fix this issue, you need to define a trait with at least one method that takes two arguments of type `Self` and returns an ordering (`Ordering`). You can then add the `PartialOrd + Ord` trait bounds to your type definition. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```rust
trait MyTrait {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering;
}

struct MyStruct;
impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
    fn cmp(&self, _other: &MyStruct) -> Ordering {
        // Your implementation here
    }
}
```

In this example, the `cmp` method takes two arguments of type `&Self`, which means it can only be called on instances of `MyStruct`. You can implement the `cmp` method according to your needs.

Note that you may need to add additional trait bounds depending on the requirements of your code.
