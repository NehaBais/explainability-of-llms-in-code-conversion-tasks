The error occurs because the C compiler cannot find the `stat` function from the `libstat` library, even though it is included. The `stat` function returns information about a file or directory, so we need to link against the `libstat` library and use the `S_ISDIR` macro to check if a file is a directory or not.

The corrected code is as follows:
```c
#include
#include
int main() {
  char *filenames[] = {"input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", "/docs"};
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < sizeof(filenames) / sizeof(char *); i++) {
    struct stat info;
    if (stat(filenames[i], &info) == 0) {
      if (S_ISDIR(info.st_mode)) {
        printf("%s is a directory\n", filenames[i]);
      } else {
        printf("%s is a file\n", filenames[i]);
      }
    } else {
      printf("%s does not exist\n", filenames[i]);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This code works the same way as the Rust code, but it uses C's `stat` function to check if a file or directory exists. The `S_ISDIR` macro is used to check if the file is a directory. The `printf` function is used to print out whether each file or directory exists or not.
