The error message indicates that the Go compiler expected to see a `package` statement at the beginning of the file, but instead found the identifier `adjective`. This is because in Go, all variables must be declared before they are used, and the `fmt.Sprintf` function requires that the variable `adjective` be declared before it can be used as an argument for the interpolation.

To fix this error, we need to declare the `adjective` variable at the beginning of the file.
Then, we can use the `fmt.Sprintf` function as intended in the code block.

```go
package main

var adjective = "little"
lyric := fmt.Sprintf("Mary had a %s lamb.", adjective)
```
