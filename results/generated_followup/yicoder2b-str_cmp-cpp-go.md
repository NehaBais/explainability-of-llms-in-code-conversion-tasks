The error mentioned is due to the fact that we are using else after a top level declaration which is not allowed. The syntax error suggests we are missing a statement after our label or else clause in C++ but it's not clear from the context how this could happen with Golang code block, hence providing an answer for both languages.

In Golang, when compiling, we can't have multiple top-level declarations. If we try to do so, we will get a compilation error. 

The error was caused by misalignment of else statement and the preceding declaration. This generally happens if there is an else following a variable declaration in C++ but not in Golang as it doesn't follow the usual structure of the language. 

To fix this, it would be necessary to reorganize your code or find another way around the issue in your context. It might involve moving some statements outside a statement block like function or changing your variable declarations accordingly which would be more specific based on your code.
