The error is that the compiler cannot find the `strcat()` and `printf()` functions because they are not included in the code. To fix this, we need to include the appropriate header files for these functions. The fix is to add `#include` statements at the beginning of the code to include the necessary header files.
Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include 
#include 
int main() {
  char s1[] = "Hello";
  strcat(s1, ", World!");
  printf("%sn", s1);
  return 0;
}
```
This code includes the necessary header files for `strcat()` and `printf()`, which are `<string.h>` and `<stdio.h>`, respectively. The `strcat()` function appends the second string to the end of the first string, while the `printf()` function prints the contents of the variable `s1`.
