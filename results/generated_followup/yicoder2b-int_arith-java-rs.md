This problem arises due to different rules for handling division and modulo operations in various programming languages. In Java, if either of the operands are zero then it throws an ArithmeticException. However, Rust uses some different rules for these operations. 

For example:
- When you calculate `5/0` in Java, it will throw an ArithmeticException saying "cannot divide by zero". But in Rust, if we use a similar rule like `5 / 2` or `div_euclid(1,  with_overflow::<usize>())`, which is the same as calculating 1 divided by 2, it will return `0` instead of throwing an error since Rust's division operation follows the "round to zero" rule. This can lead to unexpected results for integer operations where the rounding to zero is not what you would expect.
- Similarly in your rust program when you write `i32::from(s1.trim()).unwrap();`, it will look for a method named `trim` on type `i32` and `usize`, but there isn't one named `trim` available, so it will fail to compile.
- Similarly in your rust program when you write `i32::from_str(s1.trim()).unwrap();`, it will look for a function/associated item named `from_str` on the type `i32` and similarly `usize` but there isn't one available named `from_str` in `i32`, so it will fail to compile again.
- When you write `let b = i32::from(s1.trim()).unwrap();`, which is the equivalent of `let b: i32 = s1.trim().into()`, which attempts to convert string to integer but fails since there isn't a method named `into` in type `i32`.
- Similarly for `usize::from(s1.trim()).unwrap();`, the error is due to the same reason. 

This issue can be resolved by ensuring that the rules for handling these operations match those used in your programming language of choice. If this does not resolve any issues then it might be worth looking at different rules or options (like using a different type or method) to see if you can resolve the problem without changing the basic rules of how the programming language handles division and modulo.
