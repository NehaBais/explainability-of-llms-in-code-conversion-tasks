The error in the code is that it uses the C++ namespace std for cout, endl, and other standard library functions without explicitly including the necessary header file. The fix is to include the #include <iostream> line at the top of the code to ensure that the standard library functions are accessible. Here is the corrected code:
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    std::cout << "a = " << a << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
