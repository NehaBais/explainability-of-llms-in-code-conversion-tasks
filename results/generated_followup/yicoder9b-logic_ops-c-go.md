The error message is indicating that there's no declared function named "main" within the main package, which in GoLang is the starting point for any program execution. 

To fix this error you need to declare a main function as follows:
```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
)
func printLogic(a bool, b bool){
  fmt.Printf("a and b is %t\n", a && b) 
  fmt.Printf("a or b is %t\n", a || b)
  fmt.Printf("not a is %t\n", !a)   
}
func main(){
	printLogic(true, false) // change the arguments to whatever you need here
}
```
