The error `undefined: ioutil.Touch` means that the Go standard library does not have an implementation of the `ioutil.Touch()` function, which is used to create a file if it doesn't exist and set its size to zero bytes. The function does not throw an error when called on non-existing files.

The error `undefined: ioutil.Mkdir` and `undefined: ioutil.MkdirAll` means that the Go standard library also does not have these functions in its implementation. These functions are used to create a directory if it doesn't exist, and they throw errors when called on non-existing directories.

To fix these issues in your code, you should either import or add an implementation of the `ioutil.Touch()` function (`os.Remove("output.txt"); ioutil.Touch("output.txt")` or a similar function which replaces an existing file with an empty one) and implement an equivalent for the `ioutil.Mkdir` and `ioutil.MkdirAll` functions, which should create directories in Go similar to how `fs.CreateDirectory()` method creates directories in C++.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Create an empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory called "docs"
	if err := ioutil.Touch("output.txt", nil); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	if err := ioutil.Mkdir("docs", 0755); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// Create the directories in / here as well
	filesystemRootDirHandle := "/"
	if err := ioutil.MkdirAll(filesystemRootDirHandle+"/docs", 0755); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```
