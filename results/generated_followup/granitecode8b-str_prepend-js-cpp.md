The error is caused by missing the filename after the `#include` directive, which specifies the header file to be included in the program. To fix this error, we need to add the filename after the `#include` directive for both `iostream` and `string`. After making this change, we also need to remove the `using namespace std;` statement since it is not necessary in C++.

Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 std::string s = ", World";
 s = "Hello" + s;
 std::cout << s << std::endl;
 return 0;
}
```
In this corrected version, we have added the filename `iostream` and `string` after the `#include` directive for both headers. We have also removed the `using namespace std;` statement since it is not necessary in C++.
