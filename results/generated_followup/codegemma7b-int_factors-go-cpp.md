The error is caused by attempting to output a `vector<long long>` where an `ostream` expects a valid data type. The fix is to convert the vector to a suitable data type, such as `vector<int>`.

```cpp
// Corrected code with vector<int> instead of vector<long long>
std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
std::cout << numbers << std::endl;
```
