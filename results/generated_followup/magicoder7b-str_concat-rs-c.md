 The error occurred because C does not implicitly declare library functions, meaning that without a prior declaration of `malloc` and `free`, the compiler will generate an error when attempting to use these functions. This is in line with ISO C99 and later standards, which disallow implicit function declarations as it could lead to subtle bugs and security vulnerabilities.

To fix this issue: 
Include the header `<stdlib.h>` at the top of your code file that declares `malloc` and `free`.

The corrected code is as follows:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // Adding this for malloc and free

int main() {
  char *s = "hello";
  printf("%s\n", s);

  int len1 = strlen(s);
  char *s1 = (char *)malloc((len1 + 6) * sizeof(char)); // "+6" for the space and null character.
  if(s1 == NULL){
    printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
    exit(-1);
  }
  strcpy(s1, s);
  strcat(s1, " world");
  printf("%s\n", s1);

  free(s1);
}
```
In the corrected code: 
- The header `<stdlib.h>` is included to provide declarations for `malloc` and `free`.
- An error check has been added after `malloc()` to avoid a potential null pointer dereference.
