The error is that the C++ code uses `#include`, while the C code does not. The C++ standard library does not have header files, so it cannot use them. To fix this, we simply remove the `#include` statements from the C code. The corrected code is shown below:
```c
#include
#include
int main() {
  struct std::filesystem::path path1 = "input.txt";
  if (std::filesystem::exists(path1)) {
    if (std::filesystem::is_directory(path1)) {
      std::cout << "The current working directory exists as a directory."
                << std::endl;
    } else {
      std::cout << "The current working directory exists with a file size of "
                << std::filesystem::file_size(path1) << " bytes."
                << std::endl;
    }
  } else {
    std::cout << "The current working directory does not exist." << std::endl;
  }
  struct std::filesystem::path path2 = "/input.txt";
  if (std::filesystem::exists(path2)) {
    if (std::filesystem::is_directory(path2)) {
      std::cout << "The root directory exists as a directory."
                << std::endl;
    } else {
      std::cout << "The root directory exists with a file size of "
                << std::filesystem::file_size(path2) << " bytes."
                << std::endl;
    }
  } else {
    std::cout << "The root directory does not exist." << std::endl;
  }
}
```
In this corrected code, we first check if the current working directory exists and print out its details. Then, we check if the root directory exists and print out its details. The fix for the C++ error is to remove the `#include` statements from the C code.
