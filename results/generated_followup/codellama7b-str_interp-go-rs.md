The error is due to the fact that the `format!` macro requires at least one formatting specifier, but there are no formatting specifiers present in the string literal passed as an argument. To fix this, you can add a formatting specifier to the string.

The corrected code should be:
```rs
fn main() {
    let str = "Mary had a {} lamb";
    let txt = "little";
    let out = format!("{}", str, txt);
    println!("{}", out);
}
```
