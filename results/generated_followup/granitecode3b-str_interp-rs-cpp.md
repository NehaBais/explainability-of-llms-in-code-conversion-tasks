The error is that the C++ compiler cannot find the required headers or types, such as `string`, `size_t`, and `cout`. The fix is to include the necessary headers and declare the types before using them in the code.

Here's how you can rewrite the corrected code in a single line:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <map>

int main() {
    std::string original = "This is a test";
    std::string value = "test";
    std::map<std::string, std::string> replacements = {{"adj", "little"}, {"name", "Mary"}};
    size_t pos = original.find("{" + replacements.begin()->first + "}");
    if (pos != std::string::npos) {
        std::string interpolated = original.replace(pos, 1, value);
        std::cout << interpolated << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
