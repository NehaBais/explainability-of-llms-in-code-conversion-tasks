 The error indicates that `fs` is not declared in the namespace where it's being used. This typically means that the necessary headers are either not included or incorrectly referenced.

The fix involves ensuring that the necessary header for `std::filesystem` is included. In C++, this can be done by including `<filesystem>` at the top of your file.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>

bool checkFile(const std::string &path) { return std::filesystem::exists(path); }

bool checkDirectory(const std::string &path) { return std::filesystem::is_directory(path); }

int main() {
  // Check in the current working directory
  std::cout << "Checking in the current working directory:" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "input.txt exists: " << (checkFile("input.txt") ? "Yes" : "No")
            << std::endl;
  std::cout << "docs is a directory: "
            << (checkDirectory("docs") ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;

  // Check in the filesystem root
  std::cout << "\nChecking in the filesystem root:" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "/input.txt exists: " << (checkFile("/input.txt") ? "Yes" : "No")
            << std::endl;
  std::cout << "/docs is a directory: "
            << (checkDirectory("/docs") ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
