Error: Call to undeclared library function 'malloc', 'strlen', 'strcpy', 'strreplace', 'printf', and 'free' with type '(void *)' or '(const char *, ...)'. The error is caused by the fact that C does not have string manipulation functions like `str_interp` in C++. To fix this, we need to include the necessary header files (`<string.h>` for `strlen`, `<stdlib.h>` for `malloc`, and `<stdio.h>` for `printf`) and declare the functions using their corresponding types.
```c
#include 
int main() {
  const char *original = "Mary had a X lamb.";
  const char *toBeReplaced = "X";
  const char *replacement = "big";
  char *newString = (char *)malloc(strlen(original) + 1);
  strcpy(newString, original);
  strreplace(newString, toBeReplaced, replacement);
  printf("String after replacement: %s\n", newString);
  free(newString);
  return 0;
}
```
