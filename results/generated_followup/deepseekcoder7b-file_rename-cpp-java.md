The error occurs because of incorrect syntax used for `Files.move()` method in Java. The correct syntax should be as follows:  

```java
File currentDir = new File(".");  //get the current working directory
        
// rename in current dir
Files.move(Paths.get(currentDir.getAbsolutePath(), "input.txt"), Paths.get(currentDir.getAbsolutePath(), "output.txt"));
Files.move(Paths.get(currentDir.getAbsolutePath(), "docs"), Paths.get(currentDir.getAbsolutePath(), "mydocs"));
        
// reset to the root directory ("/") before renaming 
File rootDir = new File("/");  
    
// rename in root dir
Files.move(Paths.get("/input.txt"), Paths.get("/output.txt"));
Files.move(Paths.get("/docs"), Paths.get("/mydocs"));
```

This will correctly move files and directories from their current location to the desired new ones in both the working directory as well as at the filesystem root level. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions for such operations. If not, your program will throw an exception.
