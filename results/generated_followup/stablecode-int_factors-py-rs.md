The error is caused by an unclosed delimiter `)`. This creates a syntax error in Rust.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that all opening delimiters have corresponding closing delimiters. In this case, the for loop and if condition both have unclosed delimiters. 

Here's the corrected code:

```rs
use std::cmp;

fn factor(n: u64) -> Vec<u64> {
    let mut factors = vec![];

    for x in 1..=cmp::min(n, u64::MAX as u64)) {
        if n % x == 0 {
            factors.push(x);
            factors.push(n / x));
        }
    }

    let mut factors_sorted = factors.clone();
    factors_sorted.sort();

    println!("{}: factors: {:?}", n, factors));
    println!("Sorted Factors: {:?}", factors_sorted));

    factors
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![45, 53, 64];
    for i in &numbers {
        factor(i);
    }
}
```

This code block contains the corrected Rust code. It fixes the issue of unclosed delimiters by adding the corresponding closing delimiters for the if condition and the for loop.
