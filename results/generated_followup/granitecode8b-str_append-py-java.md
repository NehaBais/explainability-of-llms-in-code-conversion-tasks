The error is due to the fact that Java 17 does not have implicitly declared classes enabled by default. In order to enable this feature, you need to add the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling the code. The fix is to add the `--enable-preview` flag to the compilation command.
Corrected code:
```java
String str = "12345678";
str += "9!";
System.out.println(str);
```
