The error was due to missing header files and undeclared identifiers, as well as syntax errors in the printf statements. The fix involved adding the appropriate header file (stdio.h) and declaring the uint8_t type. The corrected code is shown below:
```c
#include
int main() {
 uint8_t a = 105;
 uint8_t b = 91;
 printf("a      = %08b
", a);
 printf("b      = %08b
", b);
 printf("a | b  = %08b
", a | b);
 printf("a & b  = %08b
", a & b);
 printf("a ^ b  = %08b
", a ^ b);
 printf("!a     = %08b
", ~a);
 printf("a << 3 = %08b
", a << 3);
 printf("a >> 3 = %08b
", a >> 3);
 return 0;
}
```
