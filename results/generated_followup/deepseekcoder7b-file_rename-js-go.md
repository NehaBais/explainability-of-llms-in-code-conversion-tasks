The error message is indicating that there's an issue with your import statements or package name, possibly due to the use of special characters which are not allowed in Go language identifiers. 

The fix would be to change `os` to a valid identifier, like `file_system` for example and it should look something like this:
```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)
func moveFile(oldPath, newPath string) {
    err := os.Rename(oldPath, newPath)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
}
func main() {
    moveFile("input.txt", "output.txt")
    moveFile("c:/input.txt", "c:/output.txt")   // assuming c drive exists, you can use filepath.Join("C:", "input.txt") to generate full path if it's on Windows
    moveFile("docs", "mydocs")
    moveFile("c:/docs", "c:/mydocs")             // same here, C:\ is used in place of c:/ due to Go's standard library functions expect windows paths without the drive letter.
}
```
This corrected code should now compile successfully. 

Please note: As said before, this script runs on Windows as "c:/" notation is used which is specific to Windows and not cross-platform compatible. You may need a third party package like `goose` or use the standard library's path/filepath package for more portable code depending on your requirements.
