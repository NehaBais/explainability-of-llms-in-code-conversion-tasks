The error message is indicating that there is no `starts_with()` or `ends_with()` member function in the `std::string` class, which are used to determine if a string starts with or ends with another string. These functions were introduced in C++17 and later, but the code uses an older version of the language that does not support them.

To fix the error, you can replace the `starts_with()` and `ends_with()` calls with the equivalent `find()` call to search for the substring within the string. For example:
```cpp
#include <cctype>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string firstString = "abcd";
  string secondString = "ab";

  // Type 1: Determine if the first string starts with the second string.
  if (firstString.find(secondString) == 0) {
    cout << "The first string starts with the second string." << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "The first string does not start with the second string." << endl;
  }

  // Type 2: Determine if the first string contains the second string at any location.
  if (firstString.find(secondString) != string::npos) {
    cout << "The first string contains the second string." << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "The first string does not contain the second string." << endl;
  }

  // Type 3: Determine if the first string ends with the second string.
  if (firstString.find(secondString) == firstString.size() - secondString.size()) {
    cout << "The first string ends with the second string." << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "The first string does not end with the second string." << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This code uses `find()` to search for the substring within the string, and checks if the result is at the beginning of the string (type 1) or at the end of the string (type 3), which are equivalent to the `starts_with()` and `ends_with()` calls.
