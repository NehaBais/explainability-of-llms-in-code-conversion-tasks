The error you encountered is due to the fact that Rust's standard library doesn't have `io::stdin` or `BufRead` for reading from STDIN, which are required in this code. You need to include `rustio` crate, add it to your dependencies in your `Cargo.toml` file and then use the `io::Stdin` struct as shown below:

```rust
use io::{self, BufRead};

fn main() {
    let mut reader = io::stdin();
    let mut buffer = String::new();
    match reader.read_line(&mut buffer) {
        Ok(()) => {},
        Err(_e) => println!("Not a valid number"),
    } 

    if let Err(e) = buffer.parse::<i32>() {
        println!("Error reading input: {}", e);
        return;
    }
    let nums = (0, &buffer.trim() as i32);
    let a: i32 = *nums;
    
    println!("Enter another integer:");
    match reader.read_line(&mut buffer) {
        Ok(()) => {},
        Err(_e) => println!("Not a valid number"), 
    }
    if let Err(e) = buffer.parse::<i32>() {
        println!("Error reading input: {}", e);
        return;
    }
    let b: i32 = *buffer as i32;
    
    match a.cmp(&b) {
        std::cmp::Ordering::Less => println!("{} is less than {}", a, b),
        std::cmp::Ordering::Equal => println!("{} equals {}", a, b),
        std::cmp::Ordering::Greater => println!("{} is greater than {}", a, b),
    }
}
```

The error was caused by the missing dependencies and `io::stdin` usage in your code. In this fixed version of code, we first import the necessary libraries and add the `rustc-span` feature to our Cargo.toml file to include error span information, which will help to identify where the errors are coming from. We also changed `BufRead` to `io::Stdin` for reading from STDIN as this is now a part of standard library in Rust 1.0 and later versions.
