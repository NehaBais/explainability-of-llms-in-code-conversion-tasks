This error message indicates that there is an issue with the function `stat` being used in the Rust code. 

The `#[warn(unused_imports)]` directive on by default in Rust, which suggests to remove unused imports to improve readability and performance. This was why some of these particular functions were not found in this scope.

Here's the corrected code:

```rust
use std::fs::{exists, File};

fn main() {
    let input_txt = "input.txt".to_string();
    let docs = "/docs".to_string();

    // Check for regular file in current working directory
    if let Ok(stat) = stat(&input_txt) {
        println!("input.txt is a regular file? {:?}", if stat.is_file() { Some(true) } else { None });
    } 
    // Check for directory in current working directory
    if let Ok(stat) = stat(&docs) {
        println!("/docs is a directory? {:?}", if stat.is_directory() { Some(true) } else { None });
    }

    // Check for regular file in root filesystem
    if let Ok(stat) = stat(&input_txt) {
        println!("/input.txt is a regular file? {:?}", if stat.is_file() { Some(true) } else { None });
    } 
    // Check for directory in root filesystem
    if let Ok(stat) = stat(&docs) {
        println!("/docs is a directory? {:?}", if stat.is_directory() { Some(true) } else { None });
    }
}
```
The `stat` function returns an `Option<Stat>` which means that it either contains the information about the file or it returns an error, if for example there is no filesystem entry for a certain path. The `if stat.is_file()` will return true if the file exists and is a regular file; otherwise, false. The `Some(true)` or `None` indicates whether it exists and whether it's a file or not. 

The `println!` macro prints the output to the console. It uses the `{:?}` format specifier for debug output which gives you an overview of the object inside the parentheses, but does not display its content in normal form.
