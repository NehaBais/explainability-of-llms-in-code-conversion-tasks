The error you are seeing is due to the fact that Go (and its version of JavaScript) does not allow comments at the beginning of functions, or outside of a 'package' statement. The 'func' keyword in your code is incorrect because it suggests that this function is part of a bigger body, but the `/tmp/yicoder2b-bit_ops-js-go.go` file doesn't seem to be the part of any package or program.

If you want to perform bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT (invert) on two integers in Golang, you can do it like this:
```go
package main
import "log"
func bitwise(a int, b int){
    //Perform AND operation 
    AND := a & b
    log.Printf("a AND b: %d\n", AND)

    //Perform OR operation
    OR := a | b
    log.Printf("a OR b: %d\n", OR)

    //Perform XOR operation 
    XOR := a ^ b
    log.Printf("a XOR b: %d\n", XOR)

    NOT_a := ~a
    log.Printf("NOT a: %d\n", NOT_a)
}
```
This function can be compiled and run by saving the code in a file like `/tmp/yicoder2b-bit_ops-go.go` (or any other file you prefer) and compiling it with `$ go build /tmp/yicoder2b-bit_ops-go.go`. Then running the compiled program would output the results of the bitwise operations on your input integers a and b.
