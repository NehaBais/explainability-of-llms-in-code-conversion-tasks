The error in this case is "expected 'package', found stringVar". This error occurs because there's no `package` keyword before the `stringVar` declaration, which violates Go's package organization rules.

To fix this issue, you can simply remove the unnecessary `package` keyword before the variable declaration.

This code does exactly what your Java code did. It declares a `stringVar` variable and initializes it with the string "def". Then, it prepends the value of another string literal "abc" to the current value of `stringVar`. The result is assigned back to `stringVar`, effectively changing its value from "def" to "abcdelf", depending on how you interpret the code.
```go
stringVar := "def"
stringVar = "abc" + stringVar
```
