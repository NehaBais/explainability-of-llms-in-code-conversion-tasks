The error occurs because Golang requires a package statement at the start of all Go source files, but the Python program does not include this as it's just defining a function. To fix this issue, we can add an empty "package" statement to our Golang file.

Here's how we do it:
```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
)

func logic(a bool, b bool) {
  fmt.Printf("a and b: %v\n", a && b)
  fmt.Printf("a or b: %v\n", a || b)
  fmt.Printf("not a: %v\n", !a)
}
```

The package statement tells Go that this is the main package to be built and executed, just like in Python where __name__=="__main__".
