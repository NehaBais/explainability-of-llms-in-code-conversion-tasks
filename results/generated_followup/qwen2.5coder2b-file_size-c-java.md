The error is caused by the fact that `IOException` can be thrown anywhere in the try block, but it cannot be caught within the try block without declaring it as such. To fix this, we need to declare `IOException` in the catch block along with the rest of the exception types if needed.

Here's a single code block with the corrected code:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      // File size of input.txt in current directory
      long size1 = new java.io.File("input.txt").length();
      System.out.println("Size of input.txt in current directory: " + size1);

      // File size of /input.txt in file system root
      long size2 = new java.io.File("/input.txt").length();
      System.out.println("Size of /input.txt in file system root: " + size2);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```

The error is fixed by declaring `IOException` in the catch block along with the rest of the exception types if needed. This allows the code to handle any possible exceptions that might occur while trying to read from or write to files.
