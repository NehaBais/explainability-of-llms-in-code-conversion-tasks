Error:
The error is that the C++ compiler is not recognizing the `NULL` identifier, which may be causing an error on some systems. To fix this, you can add `#include "Windows.h"` to the top of your code, which defines the `NULL` constant as 0. Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <windows.h>
int main() {
  struct _finddata_t;
  void *hFind = NULL;
  char cPath[MAX_PATH];
  // Get the current working directory path.
  getcwd(cPath, sizeof(cPath));
  strcat(cPath, "/input.txt");
  if (_findfirst(cPath, &hFind) == 0) {
    _findclose(hFind);
    std::cout << "File exists in the current working directory." << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "File does not exist in the current working directory."
              << std::endl;
  }
  // Get the root directory path.
  sprintf(cPath, "/");
  if (_findfirst(cPath, &hFind) == 0) {
    _findclose(hFind);
    strcat(cPath, "input.txt");
    if (_access(cPath, 0) != -1) {
      std::cout << "File exists in the root directory." << std::endl;
    } else {
      std::cout << "File does not exist in the root directory." << std::endl;
    }
  } else {
    std::cout << "Directory does not exist in the root directory." << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
