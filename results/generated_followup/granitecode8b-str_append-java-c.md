The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the declaration for `strcpy`, `printf`, and `strcat`. These functions are part of the C standard library, so we need to include the appropriate header files to declare these functions. The fix is to add `#include  and ` #include 
 after the first line of code.
Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include
#include
int main() {
 char str[100];
 strcpy(str, "abc");
 printf("%s", str);
 strcat(str, "def");
 printf("%s", str);
 return 0;
}
```
