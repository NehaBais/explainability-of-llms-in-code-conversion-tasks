The error in a single line is: "error: mismatched closing delimiter: `)`". This occurred because there was an unexpected closing delimiter (`))`).

To fix this, we need to ensure that each comparison operator is used correctly with the appropriate number of operands and parentheses. In Rust, we can use chained comparison operators like `a < b < 10`, which checks if both conditions are true.

Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```rust
use std::io;

fn main() 
{
    let mut a = String::new();
    let mut b = String::new();

    io::stdin().read_line(&mut a)).expect("Failed to read line");
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut b))).expect("Failed to read line");

    let a: i32 = match a.trim().parse() 
    {
        Ok(num) => num,
        Err(_) => panic!("Please enter a valid integer for 'a'."),
    };

    let b: i32 
```
