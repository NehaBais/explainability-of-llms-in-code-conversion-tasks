The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the declarations for two functions, `strcat` and `printf`, which are used in the code. This can be fixed by including the appropriate header files, `<string.h>` and `<stdio.h>`, respectively. Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include
#include
int main() {
  char greeting[] = "Hello";
  strcat(greeting, ", world!");
  printf("%s", greeting);
  return 0;
}
```
This code initializes a character array `greeting` with the string "Hello", appends the string literal ", world!" to it using `strcat`, and then displays the contents of `greeting` using `printf`. The header files `<string.h>` and `<stdio.h>` are included at the beginning of the code to provide the declarations for these functions.
