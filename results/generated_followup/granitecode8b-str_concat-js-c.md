The error is that the C compiler does not recognize `printf()` as a library function, so it cannot find the declaration for it. This can be fixed by including the header file `<stdio.h>` at the beginning of the program, which declares `printf()`. Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```c
#include 
int main() {
  char *s = "hello";
  printf("%s there!", s);
  return 0;
}
```
Note that the header file must be included before any function calls, so it should be the first line of the program. Also, make sure to use double quotes (`"`) around string literals in C, unlike single quotes (`'`) in JavaScript.
