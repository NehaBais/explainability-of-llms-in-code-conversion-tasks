The error in the Rust code is that it tries to use the `+=` operator, which is not available until Java 17 or later. The fix is to use the `+` operator instead, like this:
```java
String hello = "Hello world";
hello += "!!!!";
System.out.println(hello);
```
The output of this code will be: `Hello world!!!`
