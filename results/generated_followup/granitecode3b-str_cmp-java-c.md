Error:
The error occurred because the C compiler was unable to find the `strcmp()` function or the `printf()` function, which were used in the Java code. The `#include` directive was used in the Java code to include the header files needed for these functions, but this did not work in the C code.
Fix:
To fix the error, I added the appropriate header file and function declarations at the beginning of the C code using the `#include` directive and the `int` keyword to declare the return type of the `strcmp()` function.
```c
#include 
#include 
void compare(char *A, char *B) {
  int result = strcmp(A, B);
  if (result == 0)
    printf("'%s' and '%s' are lexically equal.\n", A, B);
  else if (result > 0)
    printf("'%s' is greater than '%s'.\n", A, B);
  else 
    printf("'%s' is less than '%s'.\n", A, B);
}
```
