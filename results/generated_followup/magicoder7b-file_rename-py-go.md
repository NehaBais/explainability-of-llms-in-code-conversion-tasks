 The error message indicates that there is a mismatched type for filepath.Separator which is an untyped rune constant 47 and an untyped string. This mismatch causes a compilation failure in Golang because the "+" operator isn't allowed on different types. We can fix this by making sure both operands are of the same type, which would be `string` since filepath.Separator is a rune and "input.txt"/"docs" are strings.

Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)

func rename() {
	err := os.Rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	err = os.Rename("docs", "mydocs")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	root := "/input.txt" // note that we're using a forward slash here as filepath.Separator doesn't work with root directories
	err = os.Rename(root, "/output.txt")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	root = "/docs"
	err = os.Rename(root, "/mydocs")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

func main() {
	rename()
}
```

This fixed Golang code will now correctly rename the file and directories in the root of the filesystem. If any of these operations fail, it will print an error message and terminate.
