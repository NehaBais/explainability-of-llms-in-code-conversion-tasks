The error message indicates that there are several issues with the code. Firstly, the C compiler does not recognize `using namespace std;` and requires the `std` library to be included explicitly. Secondly, the C compiler does not recognize some of the functions used in the code, such as `strncmp`, `strcmp`, and `strstr`. Finally, there are some type mismatches between variables that can lead to errors.
The fix involves adding the necessary header files for string manipulation functions (`<string.h>`), including the standard library (`<stdio.h>`), and specifying the correct data types for variables. Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
    char s1[] = "hello world";
    char s2[] = "world";
    int result1 = strncmp(s1, s2, strlen(s2));
    int result2 = strcmp(s1 + strlen(s1) - strlen(s2), s2);
    char *loc = strstr(s1, s2);
    if (loc != NULL) {
        printf("String found at location: %ldn", loc - s1);
    }
    int result3 = loc != NULL;
    return 0;
}
```
