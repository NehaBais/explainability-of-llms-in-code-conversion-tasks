Your request can't be completed as it involves multiple concepts from different programming languages. The JavaScript code you provided tries to create directories recursively if they don't already exist, which is similar to the POSIX `mkdir -p` command, and it's implemented using the built-in `fs` module in Node.js.

The Rust equivalent would be quite different. For example, Rust does not have a direct equivalent to POSIX `mkdir -p` or cross-platform filesystem operations. Instead, we can use `std::fs::create_dir_recursive` which will create all the parent directories if they don't exist.

Here is an example of creating a directory in Rust:

```rust
use std::fs::{self, create_dir_if};

fn main() {
    let dir = "/path/to/directory";

    // Creating the directory if it does not already exist
    create_dir_if(dir).expect(&format!("Failed to create {}.", dir));
}
```
This will create all parent directories of '/path/to/directory' if they don't exist yet. If a parent directory is missing, it will be created successfully. If the directory already exists or could not be created due to some reason, this function will panic with error message about the failure.
