The error indicates that the linker cannot find the definition of the `main` function, which is required as an entry point for any C++ program. To fix this, you need to define a `main` function in your program.

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <set>

int main() {
  return 0;
}
```

This minimal `main` function ensures the linker finds its definition and resolves the error.
