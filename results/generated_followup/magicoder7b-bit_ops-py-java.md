 The error message is indicating that Java cannot find the BitSet class, because it has not been imported or declared at the beginning of the Main class file. 
The fix would be to add "import java.nio.BitSet;" at the start of your file, so Java knows which BitSet class you are referring to.

Here is the corrected code:
```java
import java.nio.BitSet;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ... (existing code here)
    }

    // ... (existing methods here)
}
```
