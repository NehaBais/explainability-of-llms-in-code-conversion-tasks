Error: "expected item, found keyword `let`" 

Fix: Replace the incorrect variable declaration with an appropriate Rust type and object creation method.

Corrected code:
```rust
let string = "abc".to_string() + "def";
```
This corrected code initializes a String variable named 'string' with the value "abc", concatenates it with another string literal "def", and assigns the resulting value to the 'string' variable.
