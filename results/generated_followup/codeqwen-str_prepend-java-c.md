Error: The operands to binary expression are of different types, 'char[4]' and 'char[4]'.

Fix: To fix this error, we need to concatenate two strings using a temporary variable or directly into the first string if it has enough space. Since the length of the final string is not known in advance, we will use a temporary variable here.
Corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char string[] = "def";
  char temp[10]; // Assuming the final string won't exceed 9 characters
  strcpy(temp, "abc");
  strcat(temp, string);
  strcpy(string, temp);
  printf("%s", string);
  return 0;
}
```
