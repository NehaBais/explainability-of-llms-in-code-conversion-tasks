The error message indicates that there are missing function declarations for `_rename`, `_rmdir`, and `_mkdir`. The functions `_rename` and `_rmdir` are used to rename files and directories respectively, while `_mkdir` is used to create a new directory. To fix this issue, we need to include the appropriate header file that declares these functions.
The fix is to add `#include` at the beginning of the code to include the `stdlib.h` header file, which contains declarations for these functions.
Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include
int main() {
  // Rename file in current working directory
  _rename("input.txt", "output.txt");

  // Rename file in filesystem root
  _rename("c:/input.txt", "c:/output.txt");

  // Rename directory in current working directory
  _rmdir("docs");
  _mkdir("mydocs");

  // Rename directory in filesystem root
  _rmdir("c:/docs");
  _mkdir("c:/mydocs");

  return 0;
}
```
Note that the header file `stdlib.h` is included by default in most C compilers, so you may not need to include it explicitly unless you are using a custom compiler or have specific requirements for including additional headers.
