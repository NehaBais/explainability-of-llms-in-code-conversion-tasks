The error is due to an unbalanced parentheses inside the console log statement. The correct syntax for console log statements allows for string interpolation using parentheses, but this was not properly implemented in the provided code snippet.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the parentheses are properly balanced within the console log statement. In this case, we can simply add an extra closing parenthesis at the end of the console log statement. This will ensure that all parentheses in the statement are properly balanced.
```javascript
let c = "cat";
let d = "dog";
if (c === d) {
    console.log(`${c} is identical to ${d})`);
} else if (c !== d) {
    console.log(`${c} is not equal to ${d})`);
}
```
