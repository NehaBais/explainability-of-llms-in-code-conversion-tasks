The error message is due to the fact that there is no method named `to_owned()` in the `String` class in Java, which means it's not a valid function call. The `to_owned()` function in Rust is used to convert a string into a type that implements `ToString`. However, as there is no equivalent functionality in Java, we need to find an alternative way to create a new string with the same value as `s` using the `String` class's constructor or by using other methods available in Java.

Here is the corrected code:
```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String s = "hello";
    System.out.println(s);

    String s1 = new String(s);
    // Alternatively, you can use:
    // String s1  = s;
    
    String s2  = s  + " world";
    System.out.println(s2);
   }
}
```
