The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the `direct.h` file, which is part of the C++ Standard Library for directories manipulation on Unix systems. 

To fix this issue, you need to include the correct header file. On a Windows system, you may want to use the function `CreateDirectoryW()` from the Windows API instead of `_mkdir`. However, it's important to note that using these functions requires linking against the Windows SDK and is generally not recommended for cross-platform development (e.g., C++).

Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

void createFile(std::string fn)  {
  std::ofstream outfile(fn);
  if (!outfile) {
    std::cerr << "Error creating file: " << fn << "\n";
    return;
   }
  std::cout << "file " << fn << " created!\n";
}

void createDir(std::string dn) {
  if (mkdir(dn.c_str(), 0666) == 0) {
    std::cout << "directory " << dn << " created!\n";
   } else {
    std<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>err << "Error creating directory: " << dn << "\n";
   }
}

int main() {
  createFile("output.txt");
  createDir("docs");
}
```
The `mkdir` function is available on most Unix-like systems by default, and creates directories with read/write/execute permissions for the user (0666). If you want to change these permissions, you can pass a different value to the second argument of `mkdir()`. Note that this code won't work in a Windows environment due to differences between Unix-like systems and Microsoft's own directory creation method.
