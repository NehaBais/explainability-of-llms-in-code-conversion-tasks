Error:
The error occurs because the Java compiler is treating the line `String s = "Hello";` as an implicitly declared class, which is a preview feature in Java 17 and later. To fix this, you can enable the preview feature by adding the `--enable-preview` flag to the Java command line when compiling the code.
Fix:
Enable the preview feature by adding the `--enable-preview` flag to the Java command line when compiling the code.
Corrected Code:
```java
String s = "Hello";
s += ", World"; // Prepend the string variable with another string literal
System.out.println(s);
```
Explanation:
In the given JavaScript code, we are trying to prepend a string literal to a string variable using the `+=` operator. However, this is not allowed in Java because Java does not support string concatenation using the `+=` operator. Instead, you can use the `+` operator to concatenate strings. In this case, we need to prepend the string "Hello" with the string ", World". We achieve this by assigning the result of concatenating the two strings to a new variable.
