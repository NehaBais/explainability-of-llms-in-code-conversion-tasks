The error in this case is related to missing semicolon (;) after the `String.format()` method call. 

To fix this error, we need to add a semicolon at the end of the line where `String.format()` is called.

Here is the corrected code block in a single fenced code block:

```java
public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    String str = "Mary had a %s lamb";
    String txt = "big";
    String out = String.format(str, txt));
    System.out.println(out);
  }
}
```
