The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the 'printf' function declaration, which is typically found in the <stdio.h> library header file. 

To fix this issue, we need to include the stdio.h library by adding the '#include <stdio.h>' line at the top of the code. This will allow the compiler to find and use the printf() function correctly.

Once we have included the library in the code, the compilation process should be able to locate the 'printf' function without any errors or warnings.

Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
// Using type coercion
void compare(int a, int b)  {
  if  (a == b)
    printf("%d equals %d\n", a, b);
  if  (a < b)
    printf("%d is less than %d\n", a, b);
  if  (a > b)
    printf("%d is greater than %d\n", a, b);
}
```
