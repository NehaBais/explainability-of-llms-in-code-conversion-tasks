The error occurs because Rust requires a `main` function to compile a file as an executable program. In Java, there is no requirement for a `main` function in order to run a program, but this is necessary in Rust. The fix is to add a simple `main` function at the end of the file, which will be ignored by the compiler.

The corrected code is now as follows:
```rust
fn main() {
    logic(true, false); // Example call to the logic function
}

fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b:  {}", (a && b));
    println!("a OR b:  {}", (a || b));
    println!("NOT a:  {}", !a);
}
```
