 The error indicates that the Go file contains an import of `"strings"` which is not used within the code. This is considered a syntax error because it's unnecessary to import packages that are not utilized.

The fix is to remove the unused import statement from the Go code.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	s := "hello"
	fmt.Println(s, "literal")
	// or
	fmt.Println(s + " literal")

	s2 := s + " literal"
	fmt.Println(s2)
}
```
