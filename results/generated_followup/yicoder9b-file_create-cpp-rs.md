The error message is saying that there's a mismatch between types, because `write_all` function expects to receive mutable references. However, when passing the `file` variable into this function, you are passing it as an immutable reference (a reference type without `mut`), so Rust doesn't allow this due to its strict ownership rules.

To fix the error, change the file variable from immutable to mutable:

```rs
fn create_empty_file(path: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut file = fs::File::create(path)?;
    io::Write::write_all(&mut file, &[])?;  // changed the reference to be mutable.
    Ok(())
}
```
