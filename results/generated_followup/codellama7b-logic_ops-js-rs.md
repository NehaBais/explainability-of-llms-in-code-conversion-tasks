Error: The `main` function is not found in the crate, which means that it was not declared or defined in the program.

Fix: To fix this error, we need to define a `main` function in the code. We can do this by adding a function called `main` at the top level of the file, like so:
```rust
fn main() {
    logic(true, false);
}
```
Now, when we compile and run the program, it should produce the expected output.
