 The error `main function not found` occurs because Rust doesn't have a built-in main() entry point like JavaScript does for command line applications. You would need to define a main function if this was intended to be a standalone application that could be executed from the command line or compiled into an executable, but it seems more likely you are trying to use this as a module within your larger codebase and in that case, there is no `main` function required.

To fix this error, simply remove the closing curly brace (`}`) at the end of your Rust code. This is because Rust requires an ending point for each block of code (functions, if-statements, etc.), and without a main() function, there's no point in requiring one at the very end of your file.

Here's the corrected version:

```rs
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
```
