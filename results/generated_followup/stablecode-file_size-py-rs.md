The error is due to an unclosed delimiter `]`. The `paths` vector contains two nested vectors, each containing one file path. 

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that all opening and closing delimiters are properly balanced. In this case, the inner vectors are missing their corresponding closing brackets (`]`)).

Here is the corrected code:

```rs
fn get_file_sizes() 
{
    let mut paths = vec![vec!["input.txt"]], vec![vec!["/input.txt"]]];

    for i in 0..paths.len() 
    { 
        match fs::metadata(paths[i].first()) 
        {
            Ok(meta) => println!("{}' size is 
{} bytes.", paths[i].first(), meta.size())
            Err(_) => println!("Could not get the metadata of 
'{}'.";, paths[i].first()),
        }
    }
}
```
In this corrected code, we have properly closed all opening brackets (`[`) in the `paths` vector, ensuring that each delimiter has a matching pair. This fix resolves the error related to mismatched closing delimiters.
