The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the declaration for `strcat` and `printf`, which are part of the C standard library. To fix this, we need to include the appropriate header files and declare the functions explicitly. Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include 
int main() {
 char str[] = "12345678";
 strcat(str, "9!");
 printf("%s", str);
 return 0;
}
```
By including the necessary header files (`stdio.h` and `string.h`) and declaring `strcat` and `printf` explicitly, we can resolve the compilation errors and run the program successfully.
