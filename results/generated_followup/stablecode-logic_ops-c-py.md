Error: The error is caused by a missing closing parenthesis at the end of the print statement.
Fix: To fix this issue, we need to add a closing parenthesis after "not a". The corrected code would look like this:
```python
def print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) -> None:
    print(f"a and b is {bool(a and b)}")
    print(f"a or b is {bool(a or b)}")
    print(f"not a is {bool(!a)}")
```
This code block contains the corrected function definition, which now includes the missing closing parenthesis at the end of the print statement.
