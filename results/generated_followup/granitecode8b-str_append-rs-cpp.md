The error is that the C++ compiler cannot find the `string` and `cout` libraries, which are used in the Rust code. The fix is to add `#include` statements for these libraries at the beginning of the code. The corrected code is as follows:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
  string hello = "Hello world";
  cout << hello + "!!!!" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
