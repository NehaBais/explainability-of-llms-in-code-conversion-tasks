The error `package encoding/utf8 is not in std(/opt/homebrew/Cellar/go/1.23.0/libexec/src/encoding/utf8)` occurred because the Go compiler is trying to compile your code using the 'utf8' package which doesn't exist because you are trying to use a function from it, and 'utf8' is part of the standard library (`std`), but in Go 1.23.0, 'utf8' is not in `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/go/1.23.0/libexec/src` (the directory where your compiled code will be).

Here are possible solutions:

- If you don't need to use the "utf8" package, consider removing it from the dependencies of your Go project by removing `"encoding/utf8"` in your 'Go mod' or 'go.mod' file if present and then running `go mod tidy`.
    
- Alternatively, you can manually compile the 'utf8' package into the standard library. Here is how to do it: remove the line with the package declaration from your `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/go/1.23.0/libexec/src/encoding/utf8` file and add the following lines at the end of your `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/go/1.23.0/libexec/src/` directory:
    
```bash
package main

import ("encoding/utf8")

func utf8.ValidRune(r rune) bool { return true } // Stubs, not actual check.
```
This `ValidRune()` function is just a stub that always returns true because the UTF-8 code point check works correctly even if you don't have the real 'utf8' package.

To summarize: one way to fix this error is by removing/changing the required encoding package in your Go code which should make the errors go away. The other way could be adding an utf8 package manually or by using another version of Golang that doesn't need it.
