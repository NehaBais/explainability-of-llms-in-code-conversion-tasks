The error occurs because Rust requires a `main` function to execute the code. In Rust, a program must have a `main` function as an entry point for running code. The JavaScript code doesn't require a `main` function since it's designed to be embedded in other scripts or modules, and not executed as a standalone program.

To fix this error, you can simply add an empty `main` function at the beginning of your Rust code. Here's the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
    logic(true, false);
}

fn logic(a: bool, b: bool)  {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
```

Now the code has a `main` function and can be executed as standalone program. After compilation, the output will be the desired results from your original JavaScript code.
