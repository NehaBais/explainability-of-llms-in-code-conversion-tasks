The error is that the C++ compiler does not recognize `vector` as a built-in type, so it cannot compile the code. The fix is to include the necessary header file `<vector>` at the beginning of the code. Here's the corrected code:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
std::vector<int> factor(int n) {
    std::vector<int> factors;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            factors.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return factors;
}
int main() {
    std::cout << "Factors of 45: ";
    for (auto i : factor(45)) {
        std::cout << i << ' ';
    }
    std::cout << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
