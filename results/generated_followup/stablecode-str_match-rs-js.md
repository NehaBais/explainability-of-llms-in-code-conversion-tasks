The error `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')` is due to incorrect placement of closing parenthesis in JavaScript conditionals.

The fix involves correctly placing the closing parenthesis after each conditional statement, like so:

```js
if (s1.startsWith(s3)) {
  console.log('Match found');
} else {
  console.log('No match found');
}
```
In this fixed code block, the `starts_with` method is used to check if the first string starts with the second string. The result of this check is then printed out based on whether or not a match was found.
