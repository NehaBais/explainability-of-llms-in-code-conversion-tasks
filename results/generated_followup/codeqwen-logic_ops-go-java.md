The error occurs because `A` and `B` are not defined variables within the scope of the `main()` function. They need to be initialized before being used in the `printLogic()` call.

To fix this, we can define `A` and `B` with appropriate values within the `main()` function:

```java
public class Main {
  public static void printLogic(boolean A, boolean B) {
    System.out.println("A and B is " + (A && B));
    System.out.println("A or B is " + (A || B));
    System.out.println("not A is " + !A);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    boolean A = true; // replace with your boolean variable
    boolean B = false; // replace with your boolean variable
    printLogic(A, B);
  }
}
```

After making this change, the code should compile and run without any errors.
