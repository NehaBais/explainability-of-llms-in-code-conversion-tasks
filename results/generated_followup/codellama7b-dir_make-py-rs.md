The error message indicates that the `Error` trait is not found in scope, which means it cannot be used to handle errors. To fix this, you need to add an import statement for the `Error` trait at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:
```rs
use std::fs;
use std::error::Error;

fn mkdirp(path: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    fs::create_dir_all(path).map(|_| ())?;
    Ok(())
}
```
