The error message indicates that the `printf` function is not defined, suggesting that the header file `stdio.h` is not included at the beginning of the program or it does not have a declaration for `printf`. To fix this issue, include the header file before defining the `logic` function as follows: 

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // include stdio.h to use printf()

void logic(int a, int b) {
  printf("a AND b:   %d\n", a && b);
  printf("a OR b:    %d\n", a || b);
  printf("NOT a:     %d\n", !a);
}
```

Now the code should compile without any errors and the logic function will output the result of "and", "or", and "not" on both arguments.
