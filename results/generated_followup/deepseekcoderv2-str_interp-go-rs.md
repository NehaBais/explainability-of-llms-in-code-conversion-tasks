 The error is due to Rust's `format!` macro requiring format specifiers (`{}`) to be directly within string literals, while Go allows them as placeholders in formatted strings. To fix this, we need to pass both the format string and the argument as separate arguments to `format!`.

The corrected code:

```rs
fn main() {
    let str = "Mary had a {} lamb";
    let txt = "little";
    let out = format!("{} {}", &str, txt);
    println!("{}", out);
}
```
