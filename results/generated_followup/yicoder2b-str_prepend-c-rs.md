The error "type `char` cannot be dereferenced" in the above code is caused by trying to use the dereference (`*cstr`) operator with a `char` type. In Rust, we can't dereference a character (a char) directly. Instead of it, we need to get its underlying byte value and insert that into our string.

The error "aborting due to 1 previous errors" indicates an issue with the compilation process. The previous error is about `E0614`, which means the type `char` cannot be dereferenced, which is a common problem in Rust when you're trying to use the `*cstr` operator and it doesn't make sense for your type.

We don't need to dereference `cstr` because `.to_string()` returns a `String`, which is already the correct type for our operation. However, we can still insert an element into string with position and value using indexing syntax (`[]`), so we should correctly use it.

Here is the corrected Rust code:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut str = "my String".to_string();
    let cstr = "Changed ".to_string();
    str.insert(0, *cstr.chars().nth(0).unwrap());
    println!("{}", &*str);
}
```
