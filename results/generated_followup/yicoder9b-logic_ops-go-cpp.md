The error is due to the fact that there's no main function provided in this C++ program, which is required for any executable application. The main function serves as the entry point of a C++ application.

To fix it, you should define a `main` function and use the `printLogic` function inside it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printLogic(bool a, bool b) {
  std::cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "not a is " << !a << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    printLogic(true, false);
    return 0;
}
```
The `main` function here just calls the `printLogic` with the parameters `true` and `false`.
