 The issue is due to the incorrect placement of the `!` operator inside an f-string expression. In Python, the `!` operator must be used directly within the f-string for it to work correctly.

The fix involves simply placing the `!` operator directly in the f-string expression as follows:

```py
def boolean_ops(a: bool, b: bool):
    print(f"{a} and {b} -> {a and b}")
    print(f"{a} or {b} -> {a or b}")
    # In Python, there is no direct 'xor' operator for booleans. However, you can use the ^ operator for integers.
    # For boolean values, we can define xor as follows:
    def bool_xor(x, y):
        return x != y
    print(f"{a} xor {b} -> {bool_xor(a, b)}")
    print(f"not {a} -> {not a}")  # Corrected line

# Test the function with different boolean values
boolean_ops(True, True)
boolean_ops(True, False)
boolean_ops(False, True)
boolean_ops(False, False)
```
