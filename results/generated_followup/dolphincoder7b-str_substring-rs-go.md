The error message indicates that the Go compiler is expecting a package statement at the beginning of the file, but it instead found an `s`. The issue seems to be caused by incorrect syntax in the Rust code being translated into Golang. 

To fix this, remove the unnecessary line from the Golang code:

```go
s  :=  "abc文字化けdef"
n  :=  2
m  :=  3

 // Print 3 characters starting at index 2  (c文字)
fmt.Println(string(s[n : n+m]))
 
 // Print all characters starting at index 2  (c文字化けdef)
 fmt.Println(s[n:])
 
 // Print all characters except the last  (abc文字化けde)
 fmt.Println(s[:len(s)-1])
 
 // Print 3 characters starting with 'b'  (bc文)
 cpos := strings.IndexByte(s, byte('b'))
 fmt.Println(string(s[cpos:]))
 
 // Print 3 characters starting with "けd"  (けde)
 spos := strings.Index(s, "けd")
 fmt.Println(s[spos:])
```

In the corrected code, there is no longer any line that starts with `s`. This should resolve the error.
