The error message indicates that there is an issue with including the correct header file for `printf`. The function `printf` is part of the C standard library, so it needs to be included in the code. Additionally, the declaration for `printf` needs to be explicitly provided.
To fix this error, include the header file `stdio.h` at the beginning of the code, and add an explicit declaration for `printf` before using it:
```c
#include 
void logic(int a, int b) {
 printf("a AND b: %d", (a && b));
 printf("a OR b: %d", (a || b));
 printf("NOT a: %d", (!a));
}
```
This will ensure that the compiler can find the declaration for `printf` and resolve the error. The code should now compile without any issues.
