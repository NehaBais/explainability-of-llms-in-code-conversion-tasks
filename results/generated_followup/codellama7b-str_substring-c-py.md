The error is due to the use of `in` as an identifier in the `str_fromstr` function, which is also a keyword in Python used for defining a loop. The interpreter interprets this as a syntax error.

To fix the issue, you can either change the name of the input parameter or wrap it in parentheses to indicate that it's a string literal:
```py
def str_fromstr(s, 'in', m):
    """
    Extract a substring starting with the first occurrence of 'in' and of length m.
    """
    start = s.find('in')
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = min(start + m, len(s))
    return s[start:end]
```
