**Error Explanation:** The error occurs because the `main` function is defined twice, which is not allowed in Golang.

**Fix:** Remove one of the `main` function declarations.

Here's the corrected code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var hello string = "Hello world"
    fmt.Println(hello + "!!!!")
}

// Removed the second main function declaration
```

This code will correctly declare and use a single `main` function, allowing it to compile without errors.
