 The error occurs because Rust interprets `<<` as starting a generic argument list instead of an arithmetic shift operation, which is not allowed without parentheses for precedence reasons. 

The fix involves adding parentheses to clarify that we are performing an arithmetic shift operation on the cast value `a as u32`.

Here's the corrected code:

```rs
fn main() {
    let a = 0b1010; // Example value for 'a'
    let b = 0b1100; // Example value for 'b'

    println!("a AND b: {}", a & b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a | b);
    println!("a XOR b: {}", a ^ b);
    println!("NOT a: {:08b}", !a); // Assuming 8-bit representation for NOT operation
    println!("a << b: {}", a << (b & 0x1F)); // Left shift, mask b to fit within 32 bits
    println!("a >> b: {}", a >> (b & 0x1F)); // Arithmetic right shift, mask b to fit within 32 bits
    println!("a >>> b: {:08b}", (a as u32) << (32 - (b & 0x1F)) | a >> (b & 0x1F)); // Logical right shift, assuming 8-bit representation for output
}
```
