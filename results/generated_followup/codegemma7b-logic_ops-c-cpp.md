**Error:** The code uses C++ features like `std::cout`, which requires including the `<iostream>` header.

**Fix:** Add the following line at the top of the code: `#include <iostream>`

**Corrected Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void print_logic(bool a, bool b) {
  std::cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "not a is " << !a << std::endl;
}
```
