The error is because the crate name cannot contain dots. The dot character can be used to separate different crates, not for the crate name.

To fix this, we change the crate name from `qwen2.5coder2b_str_cmp_go_rs` to just `qwen2.5coder2b_str_cmp`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = "cat";
    let d = "dog";

    println!("{} is bytewise identical to {}", c, d);
    println!("{} is bytewise different from {}", c, d);
    println!("{} is lexically bytewise greater than {}, {}", c, d, c > d);
    println!("{} is lexically bytewise less than {}, {}", c, d, c < d);
    println!("{} is lexically bytewise greater than or equal to {}, {}", c, d, c >= d);
    println!("{} is lexically bytewise less than or equal to {}, {}", c, d, c <= d);

    let num_c: i32 = c.parse().unwrap();
    let num_d: i32 = d.parse().unwrap();

    println!("{} equals {} as numbers {}", c, d, num_c == num_d);
}
```
