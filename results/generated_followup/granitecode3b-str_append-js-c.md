Error: The C compiler is unable to find the `strcat()` and `printf()` functions, which are standard library functions used for string concatenation and printing, respectively. To fix this error, you need to include the header files that declare these functions, or explicitly provide their declarations in your code.
Fix: Add the following lines of code at the beginning of your C program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char s1[] = "Hello";
  strcat(s1, ", World!");
  printf("%s", s1);
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation of the error:
The C compiler is unable to find the `strcat()` and `printf()` functions because they are not built-in functions in C. They are part of the standard library, which needs to be included in the code. The fix involves including the header files that declare these functions or explicitly providing their declarations in your code.
