Error: "use of undeclared identifier" for O_WRONLY, O_CREAT, O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, close, and S_IRWXU.
Fix: Declare the constants using `using namespace std;` before using them.
Corrected code:
```cpp
#include
#include
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int fd1 = open("output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
  close(fd1);
  mkdir("docs", S_IRWXU);
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the identifiers `O_WRONLY`, `O_CREAT`, `O_TRUNC`, `S_IRUSR`, `S_IWUSR`, `close`, and `S_IRWXU` were not declared in the code. By adding `using namespace std;` at the beginning of the program, we declare these constants for use in the code. This ensures that the identifiers are recognized by the compiler and resolves the errors.
