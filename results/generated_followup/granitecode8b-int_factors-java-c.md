The error message indicates that there are several issues with the code. Firstly, the headers for `stdio.h`, `math.h`, and `treeset` need to be included at the beginning of the file. Secondly, the function declaration for `sqrt` needs to be added. Finally, the correct syntax for a range-based for loop is used instead of a normal for loop.
The fix involves adding the necessary headers and correcting the function declaration for `sqrt`. The corrected code is as follows:
```c
#include 
#include 
#include 
#include 
int main() {
  long n;
  printf("Enter a positive integer: ");
  scanf("%ld", &n);
  std::treeset factors = {n, 1};
  for (long test = n - 1; test >= sqrt(n); test--)
    if (n % test == 0) {
      factors.insert(test);
      factors.insert(n / test);
    }
  printf("Factors of %ld:n", n);
  for (auto factor : factors)
    printf("%ldn", factor);
  return 0;
}
```
