 The error occurs because the linker cannot find the `main` symbol, which is needed to start execution of the C program. In C/C++, there must be an entry point function named `main`. It's where control starts when you run a program. Therefore, your program should begin with the line `#include <stdio.h>` and end with `return 0;}` in your `main` function.

Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void printLogic(int a, int b) {
    printf("a and b is %d\n", (a && b));
    printf("a or b is %d\n", (a || b));
    printf("not a is %d\n", !a);
}

int main() {
  printLogic(1, 1); // Prints 'a and b is 1' , 'a or b is 1', 'not a is 0'
  printLogic(0, 1); // Prints 'a and b is 0' , 'a or b is 1', 'not a is 1'
  
  return 0;
}
```
In the `main` function, we call our `printLogic` function with some test values. As requested, this code should only contain one fenced code block.
