The error is due to missing header files and function declarations. To fix it, we need to include the `stdio.h` header file and explicitly declare the `printf` function. Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include 
int bitwise(int a, int b) {
 printf("a AND b: %d", a & b);
 printf("n");
 printf("a OR b: %dn", a | b);
 printf("a XOR b: %dn", a ^ b);
 printf("NOT a: %dn", ~a);
 printf("a << b: %dn", a << b);   // left shift
 printf("a >> b: %dn", a >> b);   // arithmetic right shift
 printf("a >>> b: %dn", a >>> b); // logical right shift
 return 0;
}
```
Now the code compiles and runs without errors. The `stdio.h` header file is included to provide access to the `printf` function, which is used to print the output. The `printf` function takes a format string as its first argument, followed by any number of additional arguments that are formatted according to the format string. In this case, the format string `"a AND b: %d"` is used to print an integer value, and the value of `a & b` is passed as an additional argument. The `n` character at the end of each line is used to insert a newline character between the output messages.
