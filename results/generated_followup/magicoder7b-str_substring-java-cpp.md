 The error is due to the missing Boost library file 'boost/utility/string_view.hpp' which is required for C++ ranges operations. 

To fix this, we need to install the Boost library on our system. If you are using a package manager such as `apt` in Debian-based systems or `yum` in CentOS, you can simply use it to install Boost:
```
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev # For Debian/Ubuntu based systems
sudo yum install boost-devel # For CentOS based systems
```
Once the library is installed, you should be able to compile your C++ program without encountering any errors.
