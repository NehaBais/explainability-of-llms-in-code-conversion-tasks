The error in the original code is that it uses `process` instead of `os` to access command-line arguments, which is not available in Golang. To fix this, we can use `flag` package to parse command-line arguments and then assign their values to variables. The fix for this error is as follows:
```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
	"strings"

 "flag"
)
func main() {
	var a, b int
	flag.IntVar(&a, "a", 0, "first integer")
	flag.IntVar(&b, "b", 0, "second integer")
	flag.Parse()

	sum := a + b
	difference := a - b
	product := a * b
	division := a / b
	remainder := a % b

	fmt.Printf("a + b = %dn", sum)
	fmt.Printf("a - b = %dn", difference)
	fmt.Printf("a * b = %dn", product)
	fmt.Printf("a / b = %dn", division)
	fmt.Printf("a % b = %dn", remainder)
}
```
The error in the original code is that it uses `process` instead of `os` to access command-line arguments, which is not available in Golang. To fix this, we can use `flag` package to parse command-line arguments and then assign their values to variables. The fix for this error is as follows:
- We import the `flag` package to add a new flag to our program that accepts two integer arguments.
- We define three new variables `a`, `b`, and `c` to store the sum, difference, and product of two integers.
- We use `flag.IntVar()` to parse the command-line arguments and assign them to the variables `a` and `b`.
- We perform the arithmetic operations and store the results in the new variables `sum`, `difference`, `product`, `division`, and `remainder`.
- We use `fmt.Printf()` to print out the results with the desired format.
Note that there is no error handling in this code since we are not performing any I/O or other operations that could potentially fail.
