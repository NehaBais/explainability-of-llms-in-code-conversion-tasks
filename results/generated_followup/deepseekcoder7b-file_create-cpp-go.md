The error message `"io/ioutil" imported and not used` means that the package "io/ioutil" was imported but not used anywhere else in the program. This is a redundant import and can be removed without affecting the functionality of your program. 

The fix for this is to remove the unused `import ("io/ioutil")` from your Go code.
