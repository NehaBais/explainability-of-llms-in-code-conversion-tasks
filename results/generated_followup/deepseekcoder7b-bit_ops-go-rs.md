The errors are due to incorrect usage of bitwise shift operations and lack of `to_bits` method for numeric types. The main issue is that Rust treats `<<` as a start of generic arguments, not a shift operation. 

To fix these issues, we can explicitly cast the integer variables to their respective bits representations (u16 or i16). For negative number right shifts, Rust does not perform arithmetic shifting and instead performs logical shifting. This is different from Go which uses arithmetic right shifts. In both cases, it's better to use unsigned types for bitwise operations as they don't have a sign bit.

Here is the corrected code: 
```rs
use std::convert::TryInto;
use std::fmt;

fn main() {
    let mut a = -460u16;
    let b = 6u8;
    bitwise(a, b);
}

fn bitwise<T: fmt::Debug + Copy + From<u16>, U: Copy>(mut a: T, b: U) 
where 
    <U as Copy>::Target: fmt::Debug, {
    
    printlnz;
    let ua = a.clone().try_into().unwrap();
    let ub = b.clone().try_into().unwrap();

    // Bitwise AND operation
    let bitwise_and = ua & ub;
    printlnz;

    // Bitwise OR operation
    let bitwise_or = ua | ub;
    printlnz;
    
}
``` 
This corrected code performs bitwise operations on two variables `ua` and `ub` which are bits representations of the original variable `a` and `b`. Please note that Rust does not have a built-in method for getting bits representation, so we need to use `try_into()` here, but it only works when T is `u16` or `i16` type. If you want this code to work with other types of variables, please specify how you'd like the function to behave in these cases.
Also, note that I have added a conditional print statement after every operation for clarity. This will not affect the functionality of your program but it makes the output easier to follow.
In addition, the `bitwise` method now requires two arguments: an integer variable `a` and a smaller integer variable `b`. The types of these variables are generic (`T` and `U`) and must implement `fmt::Debug + Copy + From<u16>` traits for numeric operations to work correctly.
You can call this function with different types, like so: `bitwise(-460 as i32, 6 as u8);`. This will perform the bitwise operation on variables of these types.
