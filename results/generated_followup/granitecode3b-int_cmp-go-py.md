The error message indicates that there is an issue with the syntax of the Python code enclosed in backticks. Specifically, it seems that the code is missing a closing `}` character at the end of the `if` statement.
The fix is to simply add the closing `}` character, which will close off the `if` statement and allow the code to be executed properly.
Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```python
package main
import sys
print("Enter first number: ")
num1 = int(input())
print("Enter second number: ")
num2 = int(input())
if num1 < num2:
 print(f"{num1} is less than {num2}")
elif num1 == num2:
 print(f"{num1} is equal to {num2}")
else:
 print(f"{num1} is greater than {num2}")
```
This code uses the `input()` function to get user input for two numbers, and then uses a series of `if` statements to check which number is larger or smaller. The `elif` statement allows us to test multiple conditions in a single block of code.
