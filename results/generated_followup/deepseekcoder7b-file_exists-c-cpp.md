The error message indicates that there are syntax errors in the `main` function. The problematic part is `<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>` which appears to be a typo or incorrect character sequence. It seems like the return statement was cut-off somehow. 

The fix for this error would be to replace it with the standard way of returning an integer from the main function, i.e., `return 0;`.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>     // for std::ifstream
#include <iostream>    // for std::cout, std::endl
#include <sys/stat.h>  // for stat() function

bool check_file(const char *path) {  // Function to check file existence
  struct stat buffer;   // buffer to hold info about the file or directory
  return (stat(path, &buffer) == 0);  // Check if file/dir exists and get its info into 'buffer' variable. Return true on success, false otherwise.
}

bool check_directory(const char *path) {  // Function to check directory existence
  struct stat buffer;
  return (stat(path, &buffer) == 0 && S_ISDIR(buffer.st_mode));  // Check if file/dir exists and it is a directory. Return true on success, false otherwise.
}

int main() {
  std::cout << "input.txt exists: " << check_file("input.txt") << std::endl;  // Checking the existance of 'input.txt'
  std::cout << "Directory exists: " << check_directory("/home/user1") << std::endl;  // Checking if '/home/user1' is a directory
  return 0;   // Returning an int value to match the standard of main function in C++. The correct return value should be 0, indicating successful termination of program execution.
}
```
This code checks for the existence of a file named `input.txt` and a directory named `/home/user1` on your system. It prints out "1" if it exists and "0" otherwise. The return statement is corrected to match the standard C++ syntax. Make sure that you replace "input.txt" and "/home/user1" with the actual paths you want to check in your case.
