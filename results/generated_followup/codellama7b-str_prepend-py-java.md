The error message is indicating that implicitly declared classes are not supported by default in Java, so we need to enable them using the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling the code.

To fix this issue, we can add the `--enable-preview` flag to the compilation command. Here's an example of how to do this:

javac --enable-preview None.java

This will compile the `None.java` file with the implicitly declared classes feature enabled.

Here's the corrected code in a single fenced code block:
```java
String s = "12345678";
s = "0" + s; // by concatenation
System.out.println(s);
```
Note that the `--enable-preview` flag is only required when compiling the code, and it does not need to be used every time we compile the code.
