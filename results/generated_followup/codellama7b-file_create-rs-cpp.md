Error: The C++ compiler is unable to find the `create` function, as it is not declared in the global namespace or any of the namespaces that are included by default.
Fix: To fix this error, you need to add a `using namespace std;` statement at the beginning of your code, which will allow the C++ compiler to find the `create` function.
