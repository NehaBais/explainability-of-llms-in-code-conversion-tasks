The error occurred because Golang does not allow function definitions to appear before package declarations. To fix this, we simply need to move the function definition above the `package main` declaration.
Here's the corrected code in a single code block:
```go
package main
func logic(a, b bool) {
    fmt.Println("a and b:", a && b)
    fmt.Println("a or b:", a || b)
    fmt.Println("not a:", !a)
}
``` 
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
