The error message indicates that there are missing include statements for `stdio.h` and `string.h`, which declare the required functions like `printf`, `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcat`. To fix this, we need to add these include statements at the beginning of the file. The corrected code is as follows:
```c
#include 
#include 
int main() {
  char s[] = "hello";
  printf("%s literaln", s);
  char s2[strlen(s) + 9];
  strcpy(s2, s);
  strcat(s2, " literal");
  printf("%sn", s2);
  return 0;
}
```
Note that we have also added the necessary header files for `char` and `NULL`, which are required by the library functions used in this code.
