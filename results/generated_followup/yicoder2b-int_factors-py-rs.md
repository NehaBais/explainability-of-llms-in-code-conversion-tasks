Sure, the problem is that we are trying to push an u32 into a VecDeque of u64. We can simply convert our u32 value to u64 before pushing it. Here's the corrected Rust code:

```rust
use std::collections::VecDeque;

fn main() {
    let nums = vec![45, 53, 64];
    for num in &nums {
        let mut result = VecDeque::new();
        let limit: u64 = *num as u64;
        for x in 1..=limit {
            if *num % x == 0 {
                result.push_back(x);
                result.push_front((*num / x) as u64);
            }
        }
        println!("{}: factors: {:?}", num, result);
    }
}
```
