The error message indicates that the `strcat` function is not declared by the compiler, which is required for the program to compile. It also states that array initializers must be initializer lists or string literals, which means we need to use the `strcpy` function from `<string.h>` for this purpose.

To fix the issue and rewrite the corrected code in a single code block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char s[] = "hello"; // Create a string variable equal to any text value.
  printf("%s literal\n", s); // Output: hello literal

  strcpy(s2, strcat(s, " literal")); // Concatenate another string literal and assign the result back to s2
  printf("%s\n", s2);                // Output: helloliteral

  return 0;
}
```
