The error occurs because the function `strcat` is used directly without first declaring it or including its header file (which contains the declaration) in your program. The error can be fixed by either including the necessary header file <string.h> that defines the `strcat()` function, like so: ```#include <string.h>```, or explicitly providing a declaration of `strcat` like so: ```char * strcat(char * restrict str1, const char * restrict str2);``` in your source code where the parameters are pointers to strings and return type is void (not necessarily necessary if you're sure that `strcat()` modifies its first argument).
