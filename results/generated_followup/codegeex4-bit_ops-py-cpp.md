The error occurred because C++ does not support control flow (e.g., `if` statements) within template definitions, and it also suggests that `rotl<width>(a, -n);` and `rotr<width>(a, -n);` are being used without declaration before they are defined or if the compiler doesn't recognize them as valid expressions. Additionally, in the line defining `mask`, there's an error due to misplaced punctuation. The fix involves removing the control flow inside template definitions, ensuring proper function declarations/definitions, and correcting the syntax errors related to misplaced punctuation. Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
template <unsigned width>
uint64_t rotl(uint64_t a, unsigned n) {
    if (n >= width)
        n %= width;
    return (a << n) | (a >> (width - n));
}

template <unsigned width>
uint64_t rotr(uint64_t a, unsigned n) {
    if (n >= width)
        n %= width;
    return (a >> n) | (a << (width - n));
}

uint64_t bitwise_operations(uint64_t a) {
    // Note: The logic here may need to be corrected based on the actual operations you want
    uint64_t signs = a & ((1ULL << (width - 1)));
    return a >> n | (signs << width - n);
}
```
