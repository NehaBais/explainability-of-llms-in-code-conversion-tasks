The error message "SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'hello'" occurs because JavaScript does not have a built-in `mut` keyword, so the use of this keyword in the Rust code is not valid in JavaScript.

To fix this issue, you can simply remove the `mut` keyword from the variable declaration in the JavaScript code. Here's the corrected code:
```js
let hello = "Hello world";
hello += '!!!';
console.log(hello);
```
