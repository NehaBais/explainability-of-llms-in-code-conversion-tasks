The error `runtime.main_mainÂ·f: function main is undeclared in the main package` occurs because the Go programming language doesn't allow us to call a function named "main" directly from the top level of a program (outside any file), since Go doesn't have a single "main" function like JavaScript.

The corrected code for GoLang can be as follows:
```go
package main
import(
	"fmt"
)
func compare(a int, b int){
    if a == b {
        fmt.Printf("%d is equal to %d\n", a, b)
    }
    if a < b {
        fmt.Printf("%d is less than %d\n", a, b)
    }
    if a > b {
        fmt.Printf("%d is greater than %d\n", a, b)
    }
}

func main(){
	compare(10, 20); // This will print that '10' is less than '20' as these are integer type.
}
```
In the provided code, we define a function `compare` which checks if two integers are equal, less than or greater than each other and prints the corresponding message. Within our `main` function, we call this method with two numbers (10 and 20) to demonstrate its usage.
