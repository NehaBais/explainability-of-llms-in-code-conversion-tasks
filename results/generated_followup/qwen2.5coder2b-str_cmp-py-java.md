The error is that `num1` and `num2` are declared as integers, which cannot be dereferenced to get their class names because they do not support object-oriented operations like `getClass()`. To fix this, you need to declare `num1` and `num2` as objects of type `Integer`, `Double`, or any other class that supports `getClass()`. You can also use the `toString()` method instead of `getClass().getName()` for integers and doubles. The corrected code would look like this:

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Integer a = 24;
    Integer b = 123;

    System.out.println(
        "a is of type "
            + a.getClass().getName()
            + " and b is of type " + b.getClass().getName());
    if (a.compareTo(b) < 0) System.out.println(a + " is strictly less than " + b);
    else if (a.compareTo(b) <= 0) System.out.println(a + " is less than or equal to " + b);
    else if (a.compareTo(b) > 0) System.out.println(a + " is strictly greater than " + b);
    else if (a.compareTo(b) >= 0) System.out.println(a + " is greater than or equal to " + b);
    else if (a.equals(b)) System.out.println(a + " is equal to " + b);
    else if (a != b) System.out.println(a + " is not equal to " + b);

    Double d1 = 5.0;
    Double d2 = 5;

    System.out.println(
        "d1 is of type "
            + d1.getClass().getName()
            + " and d2 is of type " + d2.getClass().getName());
    if (d1.compareTo(d2) < 0) System.out.println(d1 + " is strictly less than " + d2);
    else if (d1.compareTo(d2) <= 0) System.out.println(d1 + " is less than or equal to " + d2);
    else if (d1.compareTo(d2) > 0) System.out.println(d1 + " is strictly greater than " + d2);
    else if (d1.compareTo(d2) >= 0) System.out.println(d1 + " is greater than or equal to " + d2);
    else if (d1.equals(d2)) System.out.println(d1 + " is equal to " + d2);
    else if (d1 != d2) System.out.println(d1 + " is not equal to " + d2);
  }
}
```
