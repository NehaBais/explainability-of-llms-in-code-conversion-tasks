The error message indicates that the Java compiler is rejecting the use of the implicitly declared classes feature, which is disabled by default. To resolve this issue, we need to enable the preview feature by adding `--enable-preview` as a compiler argument.
The fix is straightforward - simply add `--enable-preview` to the compilation command line.
Here's the corrected code:
```java
--enable-preview
public static void printLogic(boolean a, boolean b) {
    System.out.println("a and b is " + (a && b));
    System.out.println("a or b is " + (a || b));
    System.out.println("not a is " + (!a));
}
``` 
Note that the `--enable-preview` option must be specified before the class name, and it must be the first command line argument passed to the Java compiler.
