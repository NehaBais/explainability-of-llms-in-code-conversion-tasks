The error message `'direct.h' file not found` is typical when compiling C programs on Windows but the header files are unavailable. This can be because the compiler does not know where to find these files, or they do not exist in your system at all. 

In order to fix it, you need to install a package that provides these missing header files (like "Development Tools" for CentOS/RHEL based systems). Alternatively, if you are on Windows and have installed MinGW compiler suite from http://www.mingw.org/, the directory containing `direct.h` is usually included in your PATH environment variable, so it can be found by the linker at compile time.

The corrected code block would look like this: 
```c
#include <stdio.<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
#include <sys/stat.h>

void create(const char *directory) {
    FILE* file;
    
    // Create an empty text file "output.txt"
    if (fopen_s(&file, directory[0] == '.' ? "./output.txt" : "C:/Users/<Your-Username>/Desktop/output.txt") == 0) {
        fclose(file);
    } else {
        printf("Failed to create output.txt");
    }
    
    // Create an empty directory "docs"
    if (mkdir(directory[0] == '.' ? "./docs" : "C:/Users/<Your-Username>/Desktop/docs") != 0) {
        printf("Failed to create docs directory");
    }
}

int main() {
    create(".");     // current directory
    create("/");  // root directory not available in windows, so we need to provide an absolute path instead. e.g., "C:/" or "file:///" etc.

    return 0;
}
```  
Please replace `<Your-Username>` with your actual username on the system where this is being executed. The provided paths are just examples, you need to provide absolute path to directory from which script/program will be running i.e., path to current working directory or root filesystem of respective OSs (as Windows does not support "/" as a relative path).
