The error occurs because the `os` package's `rename` function cannot handle strings directly, but it expects them to be pathnames that can be interpreted by the system. The `os.PathSeparator` constant is a string that represents the platform-specific directory separator. By using this operator and the string "docs", you are trying to concatenate two different types of values: an untyped rune (representing the separator) with an untyped string ("docs").
To fix this issue, you need to convert the `os.PathSeparator` constant into a string before concatenating it with the pathnames. Here's how you can modify the code to resolve the error:
```go
package main

import  (
	 "fmt"
	 "os"
)

func main() {
	 // Rename "input.txt" to "output.txt", both in current working dir and filesystem root
	 os.Rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
	 os.Rename(string(os.PathSeparator) +  "docs", string(os.PathSeparator) +  "mydocs")

	 // Same as above, but in reverse order for testing purposes
	 os.Rename("output.txt",  "input.txt")
	 os.Rename(string(os.PathSeparator) +  "mydocs", string(os.PathSeparator) +  "docs")
}
```
In this modified version of the code, we convert the `os.PathSeparator` constant into a string using the `string()` function before concatenating it with the pathnames. This ensures that the `rename` function can handle strings correctly and resolves the error related to mismatched types.
By executing this code in the Go compiler, you will find out that there are no errors or warnings, indicating that the code has been successfully compiled and executed. You can now perform file renaming in both current working directory and filesystem root using Golang's `os` package.
