**Error Explanation:**
The error occurs because `strcat` is an external function, and it needs to be declared before its use in C programs. In C, all functions used must either be defined in the same file or declared before their first call.

**Fix Explanation:**
To fix this, you need to include the `<string.h>` header file which contains the declaration for `strcat`.

Here is the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

void rename_file(const char *old_name, const char *new_name) {
  if (rename(old_name, new_name) != 0) {
    perror("Error renaming file");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
}

int main() {
  // Here in the current working directory
  rename_file("input.txt", "output.txt");
  rename_file("docs", "mydocs");

  // In the filesystem root
  char *root_path = "/";
  char path[1024]; // Buffer to hold full path
  strcpy(path, root_path);
  strcat(path, "input.txt");
  rename_file(path, strcat(path, "_output"));
  
  strcpy(path, root_path);
  strcat(path, "docs");
  rename_file(path, strcat(path, "_mydocs"));

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

In this corrected version:
- I included `<string.h>` to provide the declaration for `strcat`.
- Added a buffer (`path`) to store and manipulate full file paths safely.
- Used `strcpy` to copy the root path into the buffer before appending other strings.
