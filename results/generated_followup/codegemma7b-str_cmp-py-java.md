The error occurs because the `compare()` method expects two `String` objects as arguments, but the code is attempting to pass an `int` and a `double` as arguments. The fix is to convert the numeric values to strings before passing them to the method.

```java
compare("24", "123");
compare(String.valueOf(5.0), String.valueOf(5));
```
