The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the files `FILENAME` or `` when it encounters the `#include` directives at lines 1 and 2. The fix is to specify the correct file names for the header files.

Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include
#include
using namespace std;
int main() {
  string s = "hello";
  cout << s << endl;

  string s1 = s + " world";
  cout << s1 << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
In this corrected code, we include the `` header file to use the `string` class and the `` header file to use the `cout` and `endl` objects for printing to the console. We also specify the correct namespace for the `std::string` type using the `using` directive at line 3.
