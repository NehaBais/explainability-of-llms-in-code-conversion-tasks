The error occurs because `Result` is not imported from the required module when using `fs::rename()` function. 

To fix this, we import the `std::result::Result` which is a generic type for representing results of operations that can fail. We then define an alias `RcResult = Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>` to make our code more concise and readable while keeping its functionality intact.

Here is the corrected code:

```rs
use std::fs;
use std::result::Result as RcResult;

fn main() -> RcResult<()>  {
    fs::rename("input.txt",  "output.txt")?;
    fs::rename("docs",       "mydocs")?;
    // The same applies for the lines below which will fail at compile time:
    //fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")?;  
    //fs::rename("/docs",      "/mydocs")?; 
    
    return Ok(());
}
```
In this corrected code, we import `Result` from the module that provides it (`std::result`), and use it as a shorthand for `Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>`. This allows us to write the function signature of our main function more compactly while still ensuring the same functionality.
