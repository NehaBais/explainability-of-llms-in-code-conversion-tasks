Error: `#include` directive requires a filename or `<filename>`, not `#include`.
Fix: Replace `#include` with `#include`.
Corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
  string s1 = "Hello";
  s1 += ", World!";
  cout << s1 << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the `#include` directive requires a filename or `<filename>` after it. In this case, there was no filename provided, so the compiler gave an error. The fix is to replace `#include` with `#include`. This will include the necessary header file for the `string` class and resolve the error.
