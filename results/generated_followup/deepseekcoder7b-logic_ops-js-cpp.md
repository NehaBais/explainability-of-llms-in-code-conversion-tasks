The error occurred because there is no `main()` function which is an entry point for C++ programs. A simple fix to this error would be adding a main function that calls our logic function with two boolean values as arguments. 

Here's the corrected version of your code snippet:
```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout and std::endl

void logic(bool a, bool b) {
    std::cout << "a AND b: " << (a && b) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a OR b: " << (a || b) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "NOT a: " << !a << std::endl;
}

int main() {  // Added the missing main function
    logic(true, false);  // Calling our logic function with two boolean values
    return 0;  // Return statement is compulsory in every C++ program's main function. It can be just 0 or any other integer as per standard coding guidelines.
}
```
