The error "Undefined symbols for architecture arm64" occurs when there are issues with linking the program correctly. It seems like the code can be compiled and run successfully, but it's important to address these types of errors during the development process.

To fix this error, you can ensure that your code is properly linked together by using the correct linker flags. In this case, it looks like the issue might be related to the missing `-framework Foundation` flag in the linker command. Adding this flag should resolve the linker error and allow the program to compile and run successfully.

Here's the corrected C++ code:
```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>

std::set<long> factors(long n) {
  std::set<long> factors;

  factors.insert(n);
  factors.insert(1L);

  for (long test = n - 1; test >= sqrt(n); test--) 
  {
    if (n % test == 0) 
    {
      factors.insert(test);
      factors.insert(n / test);
    }
  }
  return factors;
}
```
This corrected code should compile and run successfully without any linker errors.
