The error message indicates that there is an issue with the syntax of the `let` statement in Rust. The expected item after the `mut` keyword is not found. This is likely due to a typo or incorrect placement of the `let` statement. 
The fix for this error would be to ensure that the `let` statement is placed at the beginning of a function or block, and that it is properly indented. Additionally, the syntax for creating a mutable string variable in Rust is slightly different than Golang. The corrected code in Rust is as follows:
```rs
fn main() {
 let mut s = String::from("world!");
 s.insert_str(0, "Hello, ");
 println!("{}", s);
}
```
This code creates a new function called `main` that contains the necessary logic to create and prepend a string variable in Rust. The `mut` keyword is used to create a mutable string variable, which allows us to modify its value later on. The `insert_str()` method is then used to prepend the string literal "Hello, " to the existing string. Finally, the modified string is printed to the console using the `println!()` macro.
