The error occurs because there is no main function in the Go file. You need to add a `main` package to your Go program in order for it to be able to run.

In Go, you can use the `fmt` package to print formatted output. The `Sprintf` function creates a string representation of the output, and the `%v` format specifier is used to represent the value as it appears in the source code. In this case, we print the result of logical "and",  "or", and "not" on both arguments a and b. This should resolve the error without any additional changes.

Now, let's execute the Go code:

```go
package main

import  "fmt"

func main() {
    a := true
    b := false

    printLogic(a, b)
}

func printLogic(a, b bool) {
    fmt.Printf("a and b is %v\n", a && b)
    fmt.Printf("a or b is %v\n", a || b)
    fmt.Printf("not a is %v\n", !a)
}
```
