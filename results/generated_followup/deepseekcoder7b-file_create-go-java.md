The error occurs because of incorrect escape sequences used in the string "already exists". In Java, backslash `\` is an escape character that denotes special characters. So to print a literal backslash we use `\\` or to print a newline we use `\n` and so on. But not every sequence after `\` is valid.

The fix for the error involves escaping these sequences correctly, i.e., changing them from `System.out<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>.println(fn + " already exists");` 
to `System.out.println(fn + " already exists");`.

Here's how you can rewrite the corrected code:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        createFile("output.txt");
        createDir("docs");
    }
    
    private static void createFile(String fn)  {
        File file = new File(fn);
        try {
            if (file.createNewFile()) {
                System.out.println("File " + fn + " created!");
            } else {
                System.out.println(fn + " already exists");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
    
    private static void createDir(String dn)  {
        File dir = new File(dn);
        if (dir.mkdirs()) {
            System.out.println("Directory " + dn + " created!");
        } else {
            System.err.println("Could not create directory: "+ dn);
        }
    }
}
```
This code will only create two files and directories in the current working directory, as desired by your initial requirement. If you want to also create them in the filesystem root or a specific location, consider passing that path when calling `createFile` and `createDir` methods respectively.
