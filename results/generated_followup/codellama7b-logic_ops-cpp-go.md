The error occurred because Go requires that all files start with the `package` keyword, which specifies the package name for the file. The code in the backticks does not include this keyword, so it is considered invalid Go code.

To fix the error, we need to add the `package` keyword at the beginning of the file. Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main

func printLogic(a, b bool) {
    fmt.Println("a and b is", a && b)
    fmt.Println("a or b is", a || b)
    fmt.Println("not a is", !a)
}
```
