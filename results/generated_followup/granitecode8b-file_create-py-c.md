The error message indicates that there are several issues with the code conversion from Python to C. The first error is that the compiler cannot find the header files for `stdio.h` and `string.h`, which are required by the functions `fopen` and `strcat`. To fix this, you need to add the appropriate include statements at the beginning of the file.
The second error is related to the use of undeclared identifiers such as `FILE`, `mkdir`, `S_IRWXU`, `S_IRWXG`, `S_IROTH`, and `S_IXOTH`. These are C-specific functions and variables that need to be declared or defined before they can be used. To fix this, you need to add the appropriate function and variable declarations at the beginning of the file.
The third error is related to the use of undeclared library functions such as `strcat`. To fix this, you need to add the appropriate function declaration for `strcat` at the beginning of the file.
Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include 
#include 
#include 
int main() {
  char directory[1024] = "."; // current working directory
  FILE *file;
  mkdir(directory, S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH); // create directory
  file = fopen(strcat(directory, "/output.txt"), "w");
  fclose(file);                      // create file
  mkdir(strcat(directory, "/docs")); // create sub-directory

  directory[0] = '/'; // root directory
  mkdir(directory);
  file = fopen(strcat(directory, "/output.txt"), "w");
  fclose(file);
  mkdir(strcat(directory, "/docs"));

  return 0;
}
```
