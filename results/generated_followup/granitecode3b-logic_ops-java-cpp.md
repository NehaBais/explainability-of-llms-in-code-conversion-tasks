Error: "expected "FILENAME" or <FILENAME>"
 Fix: Provide the filename of the file containing the header, if any. Use `#include "filename"` if there is a header file with the same name as the included file.
 Revised code: 
```cpp
#include 
 using namespace std;
 int main() {
  bool a, b;
  cout << "Enter two boolean values (0 or 1): ";
  cin >> a >> b;
  cout << "a AND b: " << (a && b) << endl;
  cout << "a OR b: " << (a || b) << endl;
  cout << "NOT a: " << (!a) << endl;
  return 0;
 }
```
