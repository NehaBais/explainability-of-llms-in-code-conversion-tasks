The error you're seeing is due to an undeclared function main in the main package. In Golang, every program needs at least one function named 'main' which is the entry point for the execution of a Go program. 

Here are the corrections:
```golang
func main() {
	logic(true, false) // call your function with boolean values
}
```
This function will correctly run the logic function you wrote in Python. If you compile and run this code, it should print "a and b: true", "a or b: true", and "not a: false" on separate lines.
