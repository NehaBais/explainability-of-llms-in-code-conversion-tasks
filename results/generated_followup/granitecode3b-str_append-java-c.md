Error:
The error occurred because the C compiler does not have implicit knowledge of the `printf` and `strcat` functions, which are required for the code to compile successfully. To fix this, we need to include the header files `<stdio.h>` and `<string.h>` to declare these functions in our code.
Fix:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
  char *string = "abc";
  printf("%s", string);
  strcat(string, "def");
  printf("%s", string);
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
The error occurred because the C compiler did not recognize the `printf` and `strcat` functions. To fix this, we included the header files `<stdio.h>` and `<string.h>`, which declare these functions in our code. After including these header files, the C compiler recognized the `printf` and `strcat` functions and compiled the code successfully.
