The error occurs because C does not have a built-in `bool` type, so the compiler is unable to understand the `bool` data type used in the function signature.

To fix this error, you can either use an integer type instead of `bool`, or define the `bool` type yourself and then use it in the function signature. Here's an example of how to do the latter:
```c
#include <stdbool.h>

int logic(bool a, bool b) {
  printf("a and b: %d\n", a && b);
  printf("a or b: %d\n", a || b);
  printf("not a: %d\n", !a);
}
```
This code defines the `bool` type using the `stdbool.h` header file, which provides the necessary definitions and macros for working with booleans in C.
