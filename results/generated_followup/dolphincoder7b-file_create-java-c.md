The error occurs because `creat` is not a built-in function in C, but it's typically provided by the operating system's C library. In this example, we are using the POSIX function to create files and directories. The `mkdir` function is already declared in `<sys/stat.h>`, which is included in the code.

To fix the error, replace `creat(filename, S_IRUSR  | S_IWUSR  | S_IXUSR) != 0)` with `(int)(creat(filename, S_IRUSR  | S_IWUSR  | S_IXUSR)) != 0` and `mkdir("/", dirname) != 0)` with `(int)(mkdir("/", dirname)) != 0`. This casts the function call to int before comparing it to zero.

Here is the corrected code in a single code block:
```c
#include  <stdio.h>
#include  <stdlib.h>
#include  <string.h>
#include  <sys/stat.h>

int main(void) {
  const char *filename = "output.txt";
  const char *dirname = "docs";

  if ((int)(creat(filename, S_IRUSR  | S_IWUSR  | S_IXUSR)) != 0) {
    perror("File creation failed");
    return -1;
   }

  if ((int)(creat("/" filename, S_IRUSR  | S_IWUSR  | S_IXUSR)) != 0) {
    perror("File creation failed");
    return -2;
   }

  if ((int)(mkdir(dirname, S_IRUSR  | S_IWUSR  | S_IXUSR)) != 0) {
    perror("Directory creation failed");
    return -3;
   }

  if ((int)(mkdir("/", dirname)) != 0) {
    perror("Directory creation failed");
    return -4;
   }

  return 0;
}
```
