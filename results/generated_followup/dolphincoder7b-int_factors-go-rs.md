The error occurs because Rust does not have built-in support for converting 64-bit integers to 32-bit integers for function parameters or return values, as they are generally too large to fit in a single machine word. 

To fix this, we can convert the number before calling the apf function by using the `try_into` method, which returns an error if the conversion is not possible. The corrected code block includes these changes:

```rust
let d  = (d as u32).try_into().unwrap();
apf(d, e);
```

This converts the `i64` value to a `u32` without causing overflow or loss of information. Now, when calling the apf function with d and e values, they are guaranteed to be 32-bit integers. The error has been resolved.
