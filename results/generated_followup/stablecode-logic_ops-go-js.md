The error is caused by an unexpected token ')' at wrapSafe (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1497:18) in checkSyntax (node:internal/main/check_syntax:78:3)) when checking the syntax of the code enclosed in backticks. 

Fix: The error is caused by an unexpected token ')' at wrapSafe (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:149 7:18) in checkSyntax (node:internal/main/check_syntax:78:3)) when checking the syntax of the code enclosed in backticks. To fix this, you need to ensure that all closing brackets are properly matched with their corresponding opening brackets in your JavaScript code.

Corrected Code:
```js
function printLogic(a, b) {
    console.log("a and b is " + (a && b)));
    console.log("a or b is " + ((a || b))));
    console.log("not a is " + (!a)));
}
```
Explanation: The corrected code fixes the syntax error caused by an unexpected token ')' at wrapSafe (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:149 7:18) in checkSyntax (node:internal/main/check_syntax:78:3)) when checking the syntax of the code enclosed in backticks. The fix involves ensuring that all closing brackets are properly matched with their corresponding opening brackets in your JavaScript code.
