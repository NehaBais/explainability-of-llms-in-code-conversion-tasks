The error message indicates that the C compiler does not recognize the `printf` function, which is part of the standard C library. To fix this error, the program must include the `stdio.h` header file, which declares the `printf` function and provides other necessary functions for input/output operations. 
Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include 
int main() {
  printf("Mary had a %s lamb", "little");
  // You can specify order
  printf("%s had a %s lamb", "Mary", "little");
  // Or named arguments if you prefer
  printf("%s had a %s lamb", "Mary", "little");
  return 0;
}
```
Note that the `stdio.h` header file must be included before any function calls, such as `printf`. The code uses the `%s` format specifier to indicate that the following arguments should be treated as strings, and the program includes the necessary library for string interpolation.
