The error is because 'close' function was not declared before it was called. In C, all functions must be declared before they are used. We can fix this by including stdlib.h header file where close function prototype exists.

Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // Include this for close()

int main() {
  // Create an empty file 'output.txt' in the current directory and root filesystem twice
  int fd = open("output.txt", O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
  if (fd == -1) {
    perror("open error");
    return 1;
  } else
    close(fd); // File created successfully. No need to write anything as it is supposed to be empty.

  // To create a file at root, you have to give the absolute path. For instance '/output.txt'
  fd = open("/output.txt", O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
  if (fd == -1) {
    perror("open error");
    return 1; // Error condition
  } else
    close(fd); // File created successfully. No need to write anything as it is supposed to be empty.

  // To create a directory, we use mkdir function provided by sys/stat.h
  if (mkdir("docs", S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXO) == -1) {
    perror("Cannot create directory 'docs'");
    return 2; // Error condition.
  }

  // To create a directory at root, you have to give the absolute path. For instance '/docs'
  if (mkdir("/docs", S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXO) == -1) {
    perror("Cannot create directory '/docs'");
    return 2; // Error condition.
  }

  return 0;
}
```
