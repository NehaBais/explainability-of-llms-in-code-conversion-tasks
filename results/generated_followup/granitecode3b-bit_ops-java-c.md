Error: Expected "FILENAME" or <FILENAME>
Fix: Add angle brackets around the filename in the include directive.
```c
#include 
int main() {
  int a = 5;
  int b = 3;
  printf("a AND b: %d", a & b);
  printf("n");
  printf("a OR b: %d", a | b);
  printf("n");
  printf("a XOR b: %d", a ^ b);
  printf("n");
  printf("NOT a: %d", ~a);
  printf("n");
  printf("a << b: %d", a << b);
  printf("n");
  printf("a >> b: %d", a >> b);
  printf("n");
  printf("a >>> b: %d", a >>> b);
  printf("n");
  printf("a rol b: %d",
         (int)(a << b)); // C does not have this built-in function, but it can
                         // be simulated with the following code: a << (b % 32)
  printf("n");
  printf("a ror b: %d", (int)(a >> b)); // same as above
  printf("n");
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the `include` directive was missing angle brackets around the filename. This is a syntax error in C. The fix was to add the angle brackets, which tells the compiler to include the file with the specified name. The corrected code builds and runs without errors.
