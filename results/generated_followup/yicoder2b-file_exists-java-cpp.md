The error "'unistd' file not found" appears because this header (file) is not included for the C++ program given above, which is written in Java. 

In C++, you need to include the `unistd.h` header file to get access to system functions related to Unix/Linux operating systems. However, it seems like you didn't have this header included at all in your Java code when compiling and thus got that error.

You can fix this by including the `<unistd.h>` header in your C++ program:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>  // added this line

int main() {
  struct stat filestat;
  if (stat("input.txt", &filestat) == 0 && S_ISREG(filestat.st_mode))
    printf("File 'input.txt' exists\n");
  else
    printf("File 'input.txt' does not exist\n");

  // checking for file in filesystem root
  stat("/docs/input.txt", &filestat);
  if (S_ISREG(filestat.st_mode))
    printf("/docs/input.txt exists and it's a regular file\n");
  else if (S_ISDIR(filestat.st_mode))
    printf("/docs/input.txt exists and it's a directory\n");
  else
    printf("/docs/input.txt exists but it's not a file or a directory\n");

  return 0;
}
```
