 The error `runtime.main_mainÂ·f: function main is undeclared in the main package` occurs because Go expects that there be a "main" function to start executing from, but the code does not have such a function.

To fix this issue, you just need to add a 'main' function to your code. The 'main' function is like an entry point for any Golang program. It gets executed when we run our program. 

Here is the corrected code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func logic(a, b bool) {
	fmt.Printf("a AND b: %v\n", a && b)
	fmt.Printf("a OR b: %v\n", a || b)
	fmt.Printf("NOT a: %v\n", !a)
}

func main() {
  logic(true, true) // Test with some sample inputs
}
```

In this corrected code, we declare the `main` function that will be executed when the program is run. Within the 'main' function, we call our `logic` function and test it with a few sample inputs (like `true`, `true`).
