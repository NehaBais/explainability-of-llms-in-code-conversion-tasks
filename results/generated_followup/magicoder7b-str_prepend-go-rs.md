 The error occurred because Rust requires that each top-level declaration (module, enum, struct, impl, or fn) is followed by a semicolon. Since `let` is not an item like module, enum, struct, etc., but rather a keyword for variable declarations, the parser got confused and returned an error.

The fix is to add a semicolon at the end of each line of code:

```rs
let mut s = String::from("world!");
s = format!("Hello, {}", s);
```

Now there are no errors, and the code will correctly prepend "Hello, " to any string stored in `s`.
