The error occurs because there is no `rename_file` or `remove_file` method in the `fs` module provided by `std::fs`. The compiler is unable to find these methods in its standard library.

To fix this, we need to add a dependency on a third-party crate for file operations. One such crate is `walkdir`, which provides various functions and methods for working with directories and files. Here's an updated code snippet that includes the necessary imports:

```rust
use std::fs::{remove_file, rename};
use walkdir::{DirEntry, WalkDir};

fn main() {
    let src  = PathBuf::from("input.txt");
    let dest1  = PathBuf::from("output.txt");
    let dest2  = PathBuf::from("/c/output.txt");

    rename(&src, &dest1).unwrap(); // unwrap() is used to propagate the error to a more user-friendly location

    for entry in WalkDir::new(".") {
        if let Ok(entry) = entry {
            if let Some(path) = entry.path().to_str() {
                println!("{:?}", path);
            }
        }
    }

    rename("docs", "mydocs").unwrap(); // equivalent to MoveFolder in JavaScript
    remove_file("/c/docs").unwrap();  // equivalent to RemoveFolder in JavaScript
}
```

In this updated code, we first import the necessary methods from `std::fs` and then from `walkdir`. We then use the `WalkDir` struct to iterate over all the files and directories within the current working directory. Finally, we apply the file renaming and folder deletion operations using their respective methods. 

Note that you may need to adjust the code based on your specific requirements or use-cases as per your own needs. For example, you can modify the `WalkDir` loop to handle different types of entries or add further processing for files and directories.
