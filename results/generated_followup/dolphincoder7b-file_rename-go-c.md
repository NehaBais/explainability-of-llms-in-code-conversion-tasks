The error is related to the fact that the rename function is not declared and linked against the C runtime library. When compiling the C code within backticks, the compiler treats it as a C++ program instead of a C program. To fix this, we need to explicitly link against the appropriate library:

```c
#include  <sys/stat.h>
#include  <unistd.h>
int main() {
  rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
  rename("docs", "mydocs");
  rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
  rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
}
```

The corrected code should be linked with the standard C library by adding the `-l` flag to the compilation command: `gcc -o file_rename -l file_rename.c`. The resulting binary will now work as expected.
