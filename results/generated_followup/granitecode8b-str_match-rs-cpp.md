The error in the code is that it uses the C++ standard library features such as `optional` and `cout`, which are not available in Rust. The fix for this error is to use the equivalent features in Rust, such as `Option` and `println!`. Here is the corrected code:
```rust
fn print_match(possible_match: Option<usize>) {
    match possible_match {
        Some(match_pos) => println!("Found match at pos {}", match_pos),
        None => println!("Did not find any matches")
    }
}
fn main() {
    let s1 = "abcd";
    let s2 = "abab";
    let s3 = "ab";

    // Determining if the first string starts with s3
    println!("{}", s1.starts_with(s3));

    // Determine if the first string ends with s3
    println!("{}", s1.ends_with(s3));

    // Count the occurrences of s3 in s1
    let count = s1.matches(s3).count();
    println!("Number of occurrences of {} in {}: {}", s3, s1, count);

    // Search for the first occurrence of s3 in s1
    let start_index = s1.find(s3).unwrap_or(s1.len());
    println!("First occurrence of {} in {} starts at index {}", s3, s1, start_index);
}
```
