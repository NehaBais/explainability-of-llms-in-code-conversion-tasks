Error: `strcat()` is an undeclared library function and needs to be included from `<string.h>`.
Fix: Include the header file `<string.h>` at the top of the C program.

Corrected Code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char s[] = "hello";
  printf("%s there!\n", strcat(s, " there!"));
  return 0;
}
```
