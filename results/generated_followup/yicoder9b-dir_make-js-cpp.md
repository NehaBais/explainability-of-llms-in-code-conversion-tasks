The error message indicates that it couldn't find the Boost `filesystem` header file, which is part of the Boost library. Boost isn't installed in this environment or its location can't be found by the compiler. 

The fix to this issue involves installing the necessary Boost libraries and ensuring that the compiler knows where to find them. On Unix-like systems such as Linux and macOS, you could use a package manager like apt (Debian/Ubuntu) or brew (macOS) to install Boost. For example on Ubuntu you can run `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`.

After the Boost libraries are installed, you need to tell the compiler where to find them. This is typically done by setting the environment variable `CPATH`, but other methods may be used depending upon your build system and development environment.

Here's an example of how the code would look like after fixing these issues:

```cpp
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>
#include <iostream>

void mkdirp(const std::string &p) {
  try {
    if (!boost::filesystem::exists(p)) {
      boost::filesystem::create_directories(p);
    }
  } catch (const boost::filesystem::filesystem_error &ex) {
    std::cout << ex.what() << std::endl;
  }
}
```
