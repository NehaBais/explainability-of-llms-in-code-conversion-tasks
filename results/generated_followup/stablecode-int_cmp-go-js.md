The error is due to the use of `true` as a switch statement, which is not valid syntax in JavaScript. 

To fix this error, we need to replace `true` with `{}`. The empty object serves as a default case when none of the switch cases match.

Here's the corrected code:

```js
let n1 = prompt("Enter number 1:") | 0;
let n2 = prompt("Enter number 2:") | 0;

switch (true) {
  case n1 < n2:
    console.log(n1, "less than", n2));
  case n1 === n2:
    console.log(n1, "is equal to", n2));
  case n1 > n2:
    console.log(n1, "greater than", n2));
}
```
This code block ensures that all three comparison operators are used in the switch statement for handling different conditions based on user input.
