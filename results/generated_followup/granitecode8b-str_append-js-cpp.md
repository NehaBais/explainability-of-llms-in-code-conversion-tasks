The error is due to missing the necessary header files for input/output and string manipulation in C++. The fix is to add `#include` statements at the beginning of the file to include these headers. Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include
#include
int main() {
  std::string s1 = "Hello";
  s1 += ", World!";
  std::cout << s1 << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This code includes the necessary headers for input/output and string manipulation, and defines a main function that returns an integer. Inside the main function, it creates a string variable `s1` and initializes it with the value "Hello". It then appends the string literal ", World!" to `s1` using the `+=` operator, which is the idiomatic way to append strings in C++. Finally, it prints the contents of `s1` using `std::cout`, followed by a newline character to improve readability.
