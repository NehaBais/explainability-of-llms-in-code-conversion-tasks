The error is that the Rust compiler requires a `main` function to be present in the code, but it does not find one in the given code snippet. The fix is to add a `fn main()` function at the beginning of the code, and then call the `logic` function within the `main` function. Here's the corrected code:
```rs
fn main() {
    logic(true, false);
}
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
```
This code defines the `main` function that calls the `logic` function with some sample values.
Note that in Rust, functions are defined with a lowercase letter as the first character of their name, while Java uses camelCase for function names. Also, the `println!` macro is used instead of `System.out.println` to format and print the output strings.
