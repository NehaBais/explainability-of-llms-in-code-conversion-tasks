The error was caused by not including the necessary header file for the `cout` and `endl` statements, as well as the use of undeclared identifiers `cout` and `endl`. The fix was to add the line `#include` at the beginning of the code, which includes the standard input/output library. The corrected code is shown below:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
void print_logic(bool a, bool b) {
  cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << endl;
  cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << endl;
  cout << "not a is " << (!a) << endl;
}
int main() {
  // Test the function with some sample inputs
  print_logic(true, true);
  print_logic(false, true);
  print_logic(true, false);
  print_logic(false, false);
  return 0;
}
```
