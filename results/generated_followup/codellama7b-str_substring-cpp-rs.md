Error: No method named `substr` found for struct `String` in the current scope.
Fix: Use the `substring` method instead of `substr` to get a substring from a string in Rust.
Corrected Code:
```rust
use std::string::String;

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("0123456789");

    let n = 3;
    let m = 4;
    let c = '2';
    let sub = "456";

    println!("{}", s.substring(n, m)); // starting from n characters in and of m length
    println!("{}", s.substring(n)); // starting from n characters in, up to the end of the string
    println!("{}", s.substring(0, s.len() - 1)); // whole string minus the last character
    println!("{}", s.substring(s.find(c), m)); // starting from a known character within the string and of m length
    println!("{}", s.substring(s.find(sub), m)); // starting from a known substring within the string and of m length
}
```
