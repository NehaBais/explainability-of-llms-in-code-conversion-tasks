The error occurred because the `let` keyword is not valid outside of functions or other blocks of code. In Rust, variables are declared with the `let` keyword at the beginning of a function or other scope. The corrected code can be written as follows:
```rust
fn main() {
 let mut str = String::from("12345678");
 str.push_str("9!");
 println!("{}", str);
}
``` 
The `let` keyword is now used to declare a variable called `str`, which is of type `String`. The initial value of the string is set to "12345678". The `+=` operator is used to append the string literal "9!" to the end of `str`. Finally, the contents of `str` are printed using the `println!` macro.
