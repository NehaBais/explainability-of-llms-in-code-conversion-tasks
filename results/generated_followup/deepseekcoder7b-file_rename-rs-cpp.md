The error occurs because `std::filesystem` is not part of standard C++ library, it's added from C++17 onwards. 

To fix this issue, you need to enable C++17 when compiling the program by using -std=c++17 flag. Then, your code should work fine.

Here's the corrected code with necessary changes:
```cpp
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>

int main()  {
    try {
        std::experimental::filesystem::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
        std::experimental::filesystem::rename("docs", "mydocs");
        // For moving files to root directory, you need full path of the file. 
        // Assume current working directory is /home/user/project and running program from there:
        std::experimental::filesystem::rename("/home/user/project/input.txt", "/home/user/project/output.txt");
        std::experimental::filesystem::rename("/home/user/project/docs", "/home/user/project/mydocs");
    } catch (const std::exception &e) {
        std::cerr << "File move error: " << e.what() << '\n';
    }
   return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>0;
}
```
This code uses the `std::experimental::filesystem` namespace, which provides filesystem access in C++17 and later, as it is part of the C++ Standard Library since C++20. For pre-C++20 compilers like GCC 8 or Clang 6, you can use `boost/filesystem.hpp` to provide similar functionality.
