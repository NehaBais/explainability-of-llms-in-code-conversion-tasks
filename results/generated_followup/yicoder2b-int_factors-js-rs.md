The error occurs because the type `u32` is trying to dereference itself, which is not allowed by Rust. Rust uses an ownership-based memory model for its programs, where each variable has a reference count that initially starts at 1 (owned), and when it's copied or assigned, that count increases by one, and when it's dropped (i.e., the last reference to the variable goes out of scope), that count decreases by one. If it reaches zero, the variable is deallocated, but the memory it points to can still be accessed if other variables refer to it.

The solution for this error would be to remove the type `u32` while trying to perform division and pushing the result into the vector. 
Here's the corrected Rust code:
```rs
fn factors(num: u32) -> Vec<u32> {
    let mut n_factors = vec![];
    for i in 1..=((*num / 2) + 1) {
        if num % i == 0 {
            n_factors.push(i);
            // The following line is added to avoid type conversion error
            n_factors.push(*num as u32 / i);
        }
    }
    n_factors.sort(); // numeric sort
    n_factors
}

fn main() {
    println!("{:?}", factors(45)); // prints [1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45]
    println!("{:?}", factors(53)); // prints [1, 53]
    println!("{:?}", factors(64)); // prints [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64]
}
```
