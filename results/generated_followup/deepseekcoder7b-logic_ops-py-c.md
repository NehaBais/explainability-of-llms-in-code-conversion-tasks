The error message indicates that there is no "main" function in the linked object files, which are required for a C program to run successfully. This usually happens when compiling with `-c` option but not linking them together. 

Here is the corrected code snippet:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void logic(int a, int b) {
    printf("a && b: %d\n", a && b);
    printf("a || b: %d\n", a || b);
    printf("!a: %d\n", !a);
}
``` 

Please note that in C, the logical operations `and` and `or` are represented by symbols `&&` and `||` respectively. The `not` operation is represented by `!` symbol before variable names. Also, please ensure that you handle these operators correctly with respect to their use case as per your requirements.
