The error is caused by an unexpected `)` at the end of a statement on line 8. 

The fix for this issue requires removing or escaping the `)` character in order to properly concatenate the two string variables (`s` and `s2`) and concatenate them with another string literal (`"literal"`)).

Here is the corrected code in a single code block:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var s string = "hello"
    fmt.Println(s + " literal"))

    s2 := s + " literal"
    fmt.Println(s2))
}
```
