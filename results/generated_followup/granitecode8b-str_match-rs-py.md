The error in the code is that the `print_match()` function definition is indented, which is not allowed in Python. The correct way to define a function in Python is to use the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. The body of the function should be indented underneath the function definition.
The fix is to remove the indentation from the `print_match()` function definition, which will make it a valid Python code block.
Here's the corrected code:
```py
def print_match(possible_match):
 if possible_match is not None:
 print("Found match at pos", possible_match)
 else:
 print("Did not find any matches")
 
s1 = "abcd"
s2 = "abab"
s3 = "ab"
# Determining if the first string starts with second string
assert s1.startswith(s3)
# Determining if the first string contains the second string at any location
print_match(s1.find(s3)) # Found match at pos 0
# Print the location of the match for part 2
print_match(s1.find(s2)) # Did not find any matches
# Determining if the first string ends with the second string
assert s2.endswith(s3)
```
This code will work as expected and print the desired output without any indentation errors.
