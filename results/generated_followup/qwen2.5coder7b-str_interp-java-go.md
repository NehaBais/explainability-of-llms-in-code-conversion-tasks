**Error Explanation:** The Go compiler expects a package declaration at the beginning of a file, not an identifier like 'adjective'.

**Fix Explanation:** Add a package declaration at the beginning of the file.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    adjective := "little"
    lyric := fmt.Sprintf("Mary had a %s lamb", adjective)
    fmt.Println(lyric)
}
```
