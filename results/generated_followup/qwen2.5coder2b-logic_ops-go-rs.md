The error is because `qwen2.5coder2b_logic_ops_go_rs` is not a valid Rust crate name. In Rust, the crate name must follow specific rules. The fix is to rename the crate to something that follows these rules, such as `logic_operations`. Here is the corrected code:

```rust
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}

fn main() {
    let (a, b) = (true, false);
    print_logic(a, b);
}
```
