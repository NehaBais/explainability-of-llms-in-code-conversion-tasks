The error is because Rust does not allow dots (.) to appear in the crate name. The solution is to either change the crate name from `qwen2.5coder2b_str_interp_go_rs` to something that doesn't have a dot in it, or use the `#![crate_name="â€¦"]` attribute to set the crate name explicitly.

Here's the corrected code block:

```rs
fn main() {
    let str = String::from("Mary had a {} lamb");
    let txt = String::from("little");
    let out: String = format!("{}", txt);
    println!("{}", out);
}
```

This will compile and run without errors.
