Error: The code is missing the header file `stdio.h` that contains the declaration of the `printf()` function.
Fix: Add `#include "stdio.h"` at the beginning of the C code to include the necessary header file.
Corrected Code:
```c
#include "stdio.h"
#include
#include

int main() {
  struct stat file_stat1, file_stat2;

  // Get the size of input.txt in the current working directory
  if (stat("input.txt", &file_stat1) == 0) {
    printf("File size of input.txt: %ldn", file_stat1.st_size);
  } else {
    perror("Error getting file size of input.txt");
  }

  // Get the size of input.txt in the file system root
  if (stat("/input.txt", &file_stat2) == 0) {
    printf("File size of /input.txt: %ldn", file_stat2.st_size);
  } else {
    perror("Error getting file size of /input.txt");
  }

  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error in the original code was that it was missing the header file `stdio.h` that contains the declaration of the `printf()` function. This is a common issue when working with C and needs to be addressed by including the necessary header file. By adding `#include "stdio.h"` at the beginning of the C code, the error will be resolved and the code will compile successfully.
