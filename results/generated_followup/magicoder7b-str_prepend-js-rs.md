 The error message "expected item, found keyword `let`" is displayed because Rust does not allow statements at the top level of its modules; it expects items like functions, structs, constants or static variables instead. This is why the `let mut s = ", World".to_string();` line was producing an error.

To fix this issue, we should wrap the code within a function or main block:

```rs
fn main() {
    let mut s = ", World".to_string(); 
    s = "Hello ".to_string() + &s;  
    println!("{}", s);               
}
```

In this version of Rust, the code is wrapped in a `main` function. This ensures it can run correctly and will not throw an error for having a top level statement. The main block is the entry point of the program, thus encapsulating all the logic inside this block is very practical to organize your project structure.
