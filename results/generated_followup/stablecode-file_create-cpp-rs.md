The error is due to an unexpected closing delimiter (`}`)) on line 10 of the code. 

To fix this, you need to properly close the opening bracket (`[`) on line 9, and also add a closing bracket (`]`) on line 11 after creating the directory using `create_dir()`.

Here is the corrected code:
```rust
fn main() {
    std::fs::create_directory("docs");

    let root = "/";
    let mut docs_path = std::path::PathBuf::from(root).join("docs");
    if !docs_path.exists() {
        std::fs::create_dir(&docs_path)).unwrap();
    }
}
```
