The error message indicates that there are type mismatches between the variables `a` and `b`, as well as between the bitwise operations and the expected output types. The fix is to ensure that all operands and results of the bitwise operations have the same type. In this case, since `a` is an `i16` and `b` is a `u16`, the bitwise operations need to be performed on unsigned values, which can be achieved by casting one or both of the operands to `u16`. Additionally, the output types of the bitwise operations should match the expected type.

Here's the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = -1i16;
    let b = 256u16;

    let and = (a as u16) & b;
    let or = (a as u16) | b;
    let xor = (a as u16) ^ b;
}
```

In this corrected code, we cast `a` to `u16` before performing the bitwise operations. This ensures that all operands and results have the same type, which is `u16`. Additionally, we cast the result of each bitwise operation back to `i16` if needed.
