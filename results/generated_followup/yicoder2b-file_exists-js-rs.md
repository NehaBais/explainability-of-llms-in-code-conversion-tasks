Sure, the given JavaScript code is checking if two files ('input.txt' and 'c:/input.txt') exist or not at the current working directory (where this script runs). 
The equivalent Rust code for it would be:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let file_exists = fs::File::exists("input.txt");
    println!("File exists: {}", file_exists);

    let file_exists = fs::File::exists("c:/input.txt");
    println!("File exists: {}", file_exists);

    let folder_exists = fs::Dir::exists("docs");
    println!("Folder exists: {}", folder_exists);

    let folder_exists = fs::Dir::exists("c:/docs");
    println!("Folder exists: {}", folder_exists);
}
```
This Rust code does exactly the same thing as your JavaScript code - it checks if a file or directory with the given names exist at the current working directory (or filesystem root if you are in the root of the system). If the `fs::File::open()` function succeeds, then the file or folder exists; if it fails, it doesn't exist.
The paths are different between Windows (using "c:/") and POSIX-compliant systems such as Linux or MacOS (using "/home/" for example), so make sure to use the correct path format for your system when calling `fs::File::open()`. 

Your original error message is not explaining well the problem. The error seems related to trying to use the `env` module from `std::process` which doesn't exist in Rust. You should use `fs` instead. Also, `File::exists` and `Dir::exists` will return true if a file or directory exists at the specified path, or root, respectively.
