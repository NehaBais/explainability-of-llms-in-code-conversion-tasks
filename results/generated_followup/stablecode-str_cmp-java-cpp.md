Error: Expected function body after function declarator

Fix: In C++, when declaring a function, we need to provide its body within the curly braces following the function declaration. However, in the given code snippet, the `caseSensitiveLexicalComparison` function is declared but its body is missing or not properly defined. To fix this issue, we need to add the proper implementation for the `caseSensitiveLexicalComparison` function inside the curly braces following the function declaration.

Corrected Code:

```cpp
#include <cctype>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

bool areEqual(std::string A, std::string B) 
{ 
    return A == B; 
}

bool areInverseEqual(std::string A, std::string B) 
{ 
    return !(A == B)); 
}

int lexicalComparison(std::string A, std::string B) 
{ 
    return A.compareTo(B));
}

int caseSensitiveLexicalComparison(std::string A, std::string B)) 
{ 
    return A.compare(B));
}

int main() 
{ 
    std::string str1 = "Hello";
    std::string str2 = "Hello";

    if (areEqual(str1, str2))))
        std::cout << "'" << str1 << "' and '" << str2 << "' are lexically equal." << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "'" << str1 << "' and '" << str2 << "' are not lexically equal." << std::endl;

    str1 = "5";
    str2 = "5.0";

    if (areEqual(str1, str2))))
        std::cout << "'" << str1 << "' and '" << str2 << "' are lexically equal." << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "'" << str1 << "' and '" << str2 << "' are not lexically equal." << std::endl;

    str1 = "Java";
    str2 = "java";

    if (areEqual(str1, str2))))
        std::cout << "'" << str1 << "' and '" << str2 << "' are lexically equal." << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "'" << str1 << "' and '" << str2 << "' are not lexically equal." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected code provides the proper implementation for both `lexicalComparison` and `caseSensitiveLexicalComparison` functions. The first function performs a lexical comparison between two strings, while the second function performs a case-sensitive lexical comparison between two strings.
