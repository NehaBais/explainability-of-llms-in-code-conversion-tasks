Error:
- The C code uses the `strcmp` function to determine if the first string starts with the second string. It also uses the `strstr` function to find the location of the first string containing the second string. The `strchr` function is used to find all occurrences of the second string within the first string. Finally, the C code uses the `strcmp` function again to determine if the first string ends with the second string.
- However, there are some errors and warnings in the C code that need to be fixed.
Fix:
- The C code should include the necessary header files for the functions used (`<stdio.h>`, `<string.h>`).
- The `strcmp` function is used to compare two strings and return an integer value indicating the result of the comparison. It takes three arguments - a pointer to the first string, a pointer to the second string, and the number of bytes to compare. In this case, we need to compare only up to the length of the second string. So, we should pass `strlen(second)` as the third argument to `strcmp`.
- The `strstr` function is used to find the location of the first string containing the second string. It takes two arguments - a pointer to the first string and a pointer to the second string. In this case, we need to subtract the length of the second string from the return value of `strstr`.
- The `strchr` function is used to find the first occurrence of a character in a string. It takes two arguments - a pointer to the string and an integer representing the character to search for. In this case, we need to pass 0 as the second argument to search for the first occurrence of a null character (`\0`).
- The C code should also include the necessary header files for the functions used (`<stdio.h>`, `<string.h>`).
Single line:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  const char *first = "This is a sample string";
  const char *second = "sample";

  if (strcmp(first, second) == 0) {
    printf("The first string contains the second string\n");
  } else {
    printf("The first string does not contain the second string\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```
