The error message indicates that the `strcat` function is not declared implicitly, which is required by C99 and later standards. The fix involves including the `<string.h>` header file or explicitly providing a declaration for `strcat`.

Here's the corrected code in a single code block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char world[] = "world!";
  char greeting[] = "Hello, ";

  // Prepend the string variable with another string literal
  strcat(greeting, world);

  printf("%s\n", greeting);
  return 0;
}
```
