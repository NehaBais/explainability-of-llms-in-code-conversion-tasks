The error is due to the fact that C++ does not have a built-in string type, so the compiler does not recognize the `string` keyword.

To fix this issue, we can use the `std::string` class provided by the standard library in C++, which allows us to create and manipulate strings. Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string hello = "Hello, ";
    std::string world = "world!";
    std::string greeting = hello + world;

    return 0;
}
```
In this code, we include the `string` header using the `#include <string>` directive, and then use the `std::string` class to create and manipulate strings. The `hello`, `world`, and `greeting` variables are declared as instances of `std::string`.
