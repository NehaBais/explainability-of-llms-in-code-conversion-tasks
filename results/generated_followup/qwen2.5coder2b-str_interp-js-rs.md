The error is because Rust does not allow dots (.) to appear in the crate name. To fix this, rename the crate from `qwen2.5coder2b_str_interp_js_rs` to something that doesn't contain a dot. For example, you could change it to `rust-str-interpolation`.

The corrected code would look like this:

```rs
fn main() {
    let original = "Mary had a X lamb";
    let little = "little";

    // Using format! for string interpolation
    let replaced = format!("{} had a {} lamb", original, little);

    println!("{}", replaced);
}
```

This code will compile and run without errors.
