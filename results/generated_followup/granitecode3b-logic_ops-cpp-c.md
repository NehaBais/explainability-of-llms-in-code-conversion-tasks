The error occurred because the `printf` function is not available in C by default, so we need to include the `<stdio.h>` header file to use it. The fix for this error is to include the `<stdio.h>` header file at the beginning of the code using the `#include` directive. The corrected code is shown below:
```c
#include 
void print_logic(int a, int b) {
 printf("a and b is %d
", a && b);
 printf("a or b is %d
", a || b);
 printf("not a is %d
", !a);
}
```
