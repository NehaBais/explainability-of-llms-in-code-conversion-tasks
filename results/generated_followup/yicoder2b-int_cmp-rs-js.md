This issue is related to the syntax of JavaScript. The issue seems to come from this line: `rl.close();` . Syntax in JavaScript is case-sensitive, so it needs to be exactly as written. 

The corrected code would look like this:
```javascript
let readline = require('readline');
let rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

rl.question("Enter first number: ", function(answer1) {
  let a = parseInt(answer1);

  rl.question("Enter second number: ", function(answer2) {
    let b = parseInt(answer2);

    if (a < b) {
      console.log(`${a} is less than ${b}`);
    } else if (a == b){ 
        console.log(`${a} equals to ${b}`); 
    } else if (a > b) {
        console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b}`);
    };
  });
rl.close();
});
```
This JavaScript script will prompt the user for input on two separate lines, then print a message based on whether the first number is less than, equal to or greater than the second number.
