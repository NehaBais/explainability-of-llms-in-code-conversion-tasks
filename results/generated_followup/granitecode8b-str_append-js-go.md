The error occurs because the variable `s1` is declared inside a function, but the `fmt.Println()` function is not defined inside the same function. To fix this, we need to define the `fmt.Println()` function outside of the function where `s1` is declared. Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
 s1 := "Hello"
 s1 += ", World!"
 fmt.Println(s1)
}
```
The `package main` statement at the beginning of the code indicates that this is a standalone program, and it defines the `main()` function as the entry point of the program. The `import "fmt"` statement imports the `fmt` package, which provides the `Println()` function for printing text to the console. Inside the `main()` function, we declare a variable `s1` with the string value `"Hello"`, and then we append the string literal `", World!"` to it using the `+=` operator. Finally, we print the contents of `s1` using the `Println()` function from the `fmt` package.
