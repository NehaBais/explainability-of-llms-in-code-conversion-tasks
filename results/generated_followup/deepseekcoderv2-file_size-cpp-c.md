 The provided C++ code was correctly converted to C, but it seems there might be an issue with how the command is executed or the environment setup for compiling the C code. However, based on the error messages, the main issues are related to syntax and missing characters in string literals and a misplaced function definition.

### Error Explanation:
1. **Syntax Errors**: The use of `printf` and `perror` functions is correct but requires proper handling of string literals which were not terminated correctly.
2. **Function Definition Placement**: In C, the main function should be defined at the start before any other code or function definitions.
3. **String Literal Issues**: String literals in `printf` calls lacked a terminating double-quote (`"`).

### Fix Explanation:
1. Ensure string literals are properly terminated with double-quotes.
2. Place the main function definition correctly at the start of the file.

### Corrected Code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void print_file_size(const char *filename) {
  struct stat file_info;
  if (stat(filename, &file_info) == 0) {
    printf("Size of file %s is %ld bytes.\n", filename, file_info.st_size);
  } else {
    perror("Error");
  }
}

int main() {
  print_file_size("input.txt");
  print_file_size("/input.txt");
  return 0;
}
```
