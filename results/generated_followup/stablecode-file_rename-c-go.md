The error occurred because the `path` package was imported but not used within the code. To fix this, simply remove the import statement for the `path` package.

Here is the corrected code in a single code block:
```go
package main

import (
    "io/ioutil"
    "os"
)

func rename(src, dest string) {
    // Check if source file exists
    _, err := os.Stat(src)
    if err != nil {
        // Source file does not exist
        return
    }

    // Read the source file into memory
    data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(src)
    if err != nil {
        // Error reading source file
        return
    }

    // Write data to destination file
    err = ioutil.WriteFile(dest, data, 0644)
    if err != nil {
        // Error writing destination file
        return
    }
}

func main() {
    rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
    rename("docs", "mydocs")
    rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
    rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
}
```
This corrected code ensures that the `path` package is not imported unnecessarily, which resolves the error that was initially present in the code.
