The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the required header file for the `stat()` function, as well as the `printf()` function used to print error messages. To fix this, we need to include the appropriate header files and declare any functions or types that are used but not declared in the code.
Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include
#include
#include
int main() {
  struct stat file_info;
  char *file_path = "input.txt";

  if (stat(file_path, &file_info) == -1) {
    perror("Error getting file size");
  } else {
    printf("File size: %ld bytesn", (long)file_info.st_size);
  }

  char *root_path = "/input.txt";

  if (stat(root_path, &file_info) == -1) {
    perror("Error getting file size");
  } else {
    printf("File size: %ld bytesn", (long)file_info.st_size);
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This code includes the necessary header files for `stat()` and `printf()`, as well as declaring the `struct stat` type that is used to store file information. It also declares the `perror()` function, which is used to print error messages. The corrected code should compile without any errors.
