The error occurs because the "strings" package is not imported. The method `strings.TrimSuffix(a, "\n")` requires this package. 

To fix it, just add `"strings"` to the list of imports at the beginning of the code as follows: 
```go
import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)
```

The entire corrected code is:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

func main()  {
	reader := bufio.NewReader(os<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜> // Remove trailing newline character
