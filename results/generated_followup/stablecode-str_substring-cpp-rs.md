The error is:
```error: mismatched closing delimiter: `)`
 --> /tmp/stablecode-str_substring-cpp-rs.rs:5:27
  |
4 |     println!("{}", &s[3..7]));
  |                           ^ unexpected closing delimiter
```
The fix is to ensure that all opening and closing parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly matched in your code. In this case, the mismatched closing delimiter error indicates that there's a mismatch between the opening `(` and closing `)` delimiters in the `println!()` macro call.

The corrected code is:
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = "01234567890";

    println!("{}", &s[3..7]));
    println!("{}", &s[..]}));
    println!("{}", &s[0, s.size()-1) )));
    println!("{}", &s[s.find('2'), 4 ..].]) )));
}
```
This corrected code ensures proper matching of opening and closing parentheses, brackets, and braces in the `println!()` macro calls.
