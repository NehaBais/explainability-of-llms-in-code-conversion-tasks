The errors occurred because Rust does not have built-in functionality for retrieving the root directory of the filesystem. The `dirs` crate was used to find the home directory, but there is no equivalent function in the standard library that would retrieve the root directory path. Also, some methods were called on references which do not exist.

The fix involves replacing those references with mutable instances and calling the functions directly on them:
```rs
use std::fs;

fn main()  {
    // Create an empty file in the current directory
    let _ = fs::File::create("output.txt").unwrap();
    
    // Create an empty directory in the current directory
    let _ = fs::DirBuilder::new().recursive(true).write(true).create("docs");
} 
```
The error messages are resolved by calling these methods directly instead of using references. The `unwrap()` method was also used to handle any resulting errors, but this can be removed or replaced with proper error handling in a production environment. Be aware that unwrapping might lead to panics if the creation fails for some reason (e.g., insufficient disk space).
