The error in the Rust code is that the `try-except` statement is not indented correctly. The correct indentation for this statement would be after the `if-else` statement.

The fix is to indent the `try-except` block correctly. The corrected code would look like this:
```python
import os
def create_directory(path):
 try:
  os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)
 except OSError as e:
  print(f"Error creating directory: {e}")
```
The error in the Python code is that the `os.makedirs()` function does not return a value. It must be called without parentheses.
