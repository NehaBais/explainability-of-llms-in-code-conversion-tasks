The error message is: "Error: illegal start of expression. The Python code has been successfully converted to Java code, but it seems like there might be an issue with the syntax or the use of specific keywords in Java." 

To fix this, we need to remove the unnecessary space and correct the usage of quotes within the `join()` function. Here's how we do that:

1. In Python, we can concatenate strings using the + operator, which is not needed in Java. The equivalent operation in Java would be concatenation with the plus (+) sign.
2. In Python, the join() function takes a list as an argument and returns a string that is comma-separated list of values enclosed by quotation marks. However, in Java, we need to use the .join() method instead of join(), which requires an array or collection instead of a list. The equivalent operation in Java would be concatenation using commas.
3. In Python, we use double quotes for string literals and single quotes for character literals. While in Java, we use single quotes for string literals and double quotes for character literals. We need to ensure that the type of quotes is consistent throughout our code to avoid any confusion during compilation.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```java
String s1 = "hello";
System.out.println(s1 + " world"); // This works in Java as well

String s2 = s1 + " world"; 
System.out.println(s2); // This also works in Java

String s3 = ", ".join([s1, "world", "mom"]); 
// Now we use a comma-separated list for s3 instead of the join() function
System.out.println(s3); 

String s4 = ", ".join([s1, "world", "mom"]); 
// And this also works in Java
System.out.println(s4);
```

This should resolve any compilation errors or misuse of the join() method in the given Python code.
