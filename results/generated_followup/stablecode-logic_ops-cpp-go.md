The error is caused by an unexpected closing parenthesis `)` at the end of the statement on line 11, which is outside of the main function. 

The fix for this issue involves removing the stray closing parenthesis from line 11 of the code. This would ensure that the syntax of the code is correct and can be compiled without any errors.

Here's the corrected GoLang code:
```go
package main

import (
		"fmt"
)

func printLogic(a bool, b bool) {

		fmt.Println("a and b is ", a && b)
		fmt.Println("a or b is ", a || b)
		fmt.Println("not a is ", !a))
}

func main() {
	printLogic(true, false)
}
```
