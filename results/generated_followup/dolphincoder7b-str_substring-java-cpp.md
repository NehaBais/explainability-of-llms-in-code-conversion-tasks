```cpp
cout << Substring::Substring(str, "Wo", 2); // Corrected code without errors
```
Explanation:
The error message `no matching constructor for initialization of 'Substring::Substring'` is due to the fact that there are three arguments provided to the Substring function. The language expects only one argument, which is a string object (in this case "Wo") and two integers representing the starting index and length, respectively.

The fix involves providing only the required argument - the string object "Wo" in the code block above. This resolves the error and allows for the Substring function to be called correctly with the desired arguments.
