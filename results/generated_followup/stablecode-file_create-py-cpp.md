The error occurs due to an extraneous closing brace (`'}')) on line 20 of the code block. This indicates that there is a misplaced or unexpected closing brace in the code, which leads to compilation errors.

Fix explanation:
To fix this issue, we need to remove the extraneous closing brace from line 20 of the code block. This will ensure that the code block is properly enclosed and will prevent any compilation errors due to mismatched braces.

Corrected code block:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
void create(const std::string &directory) {
    std::ofstream output_file{fs::path{directory} / "output.txt"} ;
    fs::create_directories(fs::path{directory}/"docs"));
}
int main() {
    create(".");
    create("/");
    return 0;
}
```
This corrected code block will compile without any errors due to mismatched braces.
