The error occurred because Python does not support assignment within an expression (like it does in C). In the given example, we are trying to assign the value of `dup.value` to `str.value`.

In the fix, we are creating a temporary variable `temp` and assigning the value of `str.value` to it before passing it as an argument to `sprintf`. This allows us to perform assignment within an expression, which is the standard way to do it in Python.

The updated code block will look like:

```python
from ctypes import  *
import string
import re
def main():
    str = create_string_buffer(b'my String')
    cstr = create_string_buffer(b'Changed  ')
    dup = create_string_buffer()
    temp = str.value
    sprintf(str,  "%s%s", cstr,  (dup.value  = temp))
    free(dup)
    print(str.value.decode())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
