The error `/tmp/yicoder2b-file_size-js-c.c:2:10: fatal error: 'windows.h' file not found` means that the compiler cannot find the windows.h header file which is a part of Windows SDK (Software Development Kit) which comes with Visual Studio.

To fix this issue, you have to first make sure that your environment includes the Windows SDK. This can be done by opening Command Prompt and running `mingw32-get-sdk`. Once it's installed, try compiling your code again. 

Here is the corrected C code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h> // Include for Windows

int main() {
  HANDLE hFile = CreateFile("input.txt", FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES, 0, NULL,
                            OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
  if (hFile == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
    printf("Failed to open file 'input.txt'.\n");
    return 1;
  }

  LARGE_INTEGER lSize;
  if (!GetFileSizeEx(hFile, &lSize)) {
    CloseHandle(hFile);
    printf("Failed to get file size of 'input.txt'.\n");
    return 2;
  }

  printf("The file 'input.txt' has %I64u bytes.\n", lSize.QuadPart);

  hFile = CreateFile("c:\\input.txt", FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES, 0, NULL,
                     OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
  if (hFile == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
    CloseHandle(hFile);
    printf("Failed to open file 'c:\\input.txt'.\n");
    return 3;
  }

  if (!GetFileSizeEx(hFile, &lSize)) {
    CloseHandle(hFile);
    printf("Failed to get file size of 'c:\\input.txt'.\n");
    return 4;
  }

  printf("The file 'c:\\input.txt' has %I64u bytes.\n", lSize.QuadPart);
  return 0;
}
```
This code reads and prints the size of two files in the current directory and the root of the file system, and also handles Windows errors to make sure that the file is opened successfully before getting its size.
