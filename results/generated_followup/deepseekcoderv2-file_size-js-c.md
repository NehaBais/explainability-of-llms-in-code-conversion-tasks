 The error "fatal error: 'windows.h' file not found" indicates that the compiler did not find the `windows.h` header file, which is part of the Windows API and required for file operations in C.

The fix is to ensure that you have included the correct libraries or headers that contain the necessary definitions and functions for file operations. In this case, the missing header file should be installed as part of your development environment on a Windows machine.

Here is the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // Include standard I/O library
#include <windows.h> // Include windows header for file operations

int main() {
  DWORD size;

  // Check the size of input.txt in the current working directory
  HANDLE hFile = CreateFile("input.txt", GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, NULL,
                            OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
  if (hFile == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
    printf("Error opening file in current directory.\n");
    return 1;
  } else {
    size = GetFileSize(hFile, NULL);
    CloseHandle(hFile);
    printf("Size of input.txt in current directory: %lu bytes\n", size);
  }

  // Check the size of c:/input.txt
  hFile = CreateFile("c:\\input.txt", GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, NULL,
                     OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
  if (hFile == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
    printf("Error opening file in root directory.\n");
    return 1;
  } else {
    size = GetFileSize(hFile, NULL);
    CloseHandle(hFile);
    printf("Size of c:\\input.txt: %lu bytes\n", size);
  }

  return 0;
}
```
