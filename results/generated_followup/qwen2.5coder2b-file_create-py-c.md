The error message indicates that the compiler does not recognize the `access` function or the `F_OK` constant which are part of the `<sys/stat.h>` header. These functions are available in Unix-like systems, but not in Windows.

To fix this issue, we need to include the correct header file and use platform-specific functions for directory creation. Here's the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void create(char *directory) {
  if (access(directory, F_OK) == -1) { // Check if the directory already exists
    mkdir(directory, 0777); // Create a new directory with default permissions
  }
}

int main() {
  create(".");
  create("/");
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- The `#include <sys/types.h>` and `#include <sys/stat.h>` headers provide the necessary data types and constants for file and directory operations.
- The `#include <unistd.h>` header provides the `access` function for checking if a directory exists, as well as the `mkdir` function for creating directories.
