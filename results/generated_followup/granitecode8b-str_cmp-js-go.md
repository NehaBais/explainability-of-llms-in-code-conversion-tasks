The error in the code is that it is trying to compare two strings with different types, which is not allowed in Golang. The fix is to ensure that both sides of the comparison are of the same type. In this case, the strings "abcd" and 123 should be compared as strings, since they are both strings.
Here's the corrected code:
```go
func main() {
 fmt.Println(
 "abcd" == "abcd", // true
 "abcd" != "dcba", // true
 "abcd" < "dcba", // true
 strings.ToLower("ABCD") == "abcd".ToLower(), // true (case insensitive)
 )
}
```
In this corrected code, I have removed the type assertion on the numeric value because it is not necessary in this case. The comparison between the string "123" and the integer 123 will automatically fail due to their different types.
