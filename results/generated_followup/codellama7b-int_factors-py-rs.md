The error occurs because the `for` keyword is not allowed outside of an item, such as a function or module. In this case, the `for` loop in line 25 is not part of any item, which is why it is considered invalid.

To fix the issue, you can move the `for` loop inside a function or module, like so:
```rust
fn factor(n: u32) -> Vec<u32> {
    // ...
}

for i in vec![45, 53, 64] {
    println!("{}: Factors: {:?}", i, factor(i));
}
```
In this corrected code, the `for` loop is now part of a function, which makes it valid Rust syntax.
