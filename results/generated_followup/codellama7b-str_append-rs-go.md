The error occurred because the Go compiler expected to see a `package` statement at the beginning of the file, but instead found a `func` declaration. This is because in Go, functions must be declared inside a package.

To fix the error, we need to add a `package main` statement at the beginning of the file. Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
	hello := "Hello world!!!"
	fmt.Println(hello)
}
```
