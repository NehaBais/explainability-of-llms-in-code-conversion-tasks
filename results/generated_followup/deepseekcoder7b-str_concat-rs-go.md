The error occurs because of incorrect use of backticks around code blocks within Go. In Golang, instead of using backticks for wrapping code, you should use them to wrap multiline strings. 

Here is the correct fix:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := "hello"
	fmt.Println(s)
	
	s1 := s + " world"
	fmt.Println(s1)
}
```
