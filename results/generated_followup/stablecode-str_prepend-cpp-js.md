The error is caused by an unexpected string after `acc` in the reducer function of the `reduce()` method. The fix involves escaping the inner parentheses of the reducer function, so that they are treated as part of the outer parentheses. Here's the corrected code:
```javascript
let myStrings = ["prepended to", "my string"];
let prepended = myStrings.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur), '');
console.log(prepended);
```
