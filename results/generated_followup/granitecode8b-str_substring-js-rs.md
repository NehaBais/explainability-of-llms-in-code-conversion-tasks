The error message indicates that the `let` keyword is not expected in the given context. This means that the `let` keyword is only allowed at the top level or within a function body, but not inside other expressions or statements. In this case, the `let` keyword is used to declare a new variable (`str`) before the function body starts.
The fix is to replace the `let` keyword with a different keyword that is allowed in the given context. For example, you can use `const` or `static` instead of `let`.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
fn main() {
 const str = String::from("abcdefgh");
 let n = 2;
 let m = 3;
 // starting from n characters in and of m length;
 println!("{}", &str[n..(n+m)]); // => "cde"
 // starting from n characters in, up to the end of the string;
 println!("{}", &str[n..]); // => "cdefgh"
 // whole string minus last character;
 println!("{}", &str[..(str.len() - 1)]); // => "abcdefg"
 // starting from a known character within the string and of m length;
 println!("{}", &str[(str.find('b').unwrap() + n)..(str.find('b').unwrap() + n + m)]); // => "bcd"
 // starting from a known substring within the string and of m length. 
 println!("{}", &str[(str.find("bc").unwrap() + n)..(str.find("bc").unwrap() + n + m)]); // => "bcd"
}
```
In this corrected code, the `let` keyword is replaced with the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable (`str`) that cannot be modified later in the function body. The `main` function is used as the entry point for the program, and it contains the `const` declaration before the other statements.
