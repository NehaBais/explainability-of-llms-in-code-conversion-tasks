The error message indicates that there are several issues with the converted code. Specifically, it appears that the C++ compiler is unable to find the `cout` and `endl` objects from the `iostream` library. To fix this issue, we can add the appropriate include statement at the top of the file. We can also use the `std::` namespace prefix before the object names to ensure that they are resolved correctly. Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
void logic(bool a, bool b) {
 cout << "a and b: " << (a && b) << endl;
 cout << "a or b: " << (a || b) << endl;
 cout << "not a: " << (!a) << endl;
}
int main() {
 logic(true, false);
 return 0;
}
```
The corrected code includes the `iostream` library and uses the `std::` namespace prefix for the `cout` and `endl` objects. This should resolve the compilation errors and allow the program to run correctly.
