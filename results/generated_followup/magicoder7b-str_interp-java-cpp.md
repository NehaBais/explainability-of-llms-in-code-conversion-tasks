 The error message "fatal error: 'boost/format.hpp' file not found" indicates that the C++ compiler can't find `boost/format.hpp`. This is because it isn't a standard library in C++, so you need to manually add it to your project and include it with the `#include` directive.

To fix this error, you must first ensure you have installed the Boost library on your system and correctly configured your build environment. If you are using a package manager like Homebrew or apt-get, you can install Boost via `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev` (for Ubuntu) or `brew install boost` (for macOS).

After that, include the library in your C++ code. If it is installed in a default location, just `#include <boost/format.hpp>`. If it's in a custom path like `/usr/local/include/boost`, then use `-I /usr/local/include` flag to specify this directory while compiling and add `#include "boost/format.hpp"` in your code.

Here is the corrected version of your code:
```cpp
#include <boost/format.hpp> // boost::str(boost::format...)
#include <sstream>          // std::stringstream

int main() {
  std::string adjective = "little";
  std::string lyric;
  lyric = boost::str(boost::format("Mary had a %s lamb") % adjective);

  // Now you can use `lyric` as you like...
}
```
