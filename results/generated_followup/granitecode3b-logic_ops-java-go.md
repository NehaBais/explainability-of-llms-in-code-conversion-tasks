The error occurred because Golang does not support package-level functions like Java. To fix this, we need to move the `func` keyword to the top of the file. The corrected code is as follows:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func logic(a, b bool) {
 fmt.Println("a AND b: ", a&&b)
 fmt.Println("a OR b: ", a||b)
 fmt.Println("NOT a: ", !a)
}
```
This code defines a function called `logic` that takes two boolean arguments and prints the results of "and", "or", and "not" on those arguments. The `func` keyword is moved to the top of the file, and the `main` package is declared at the beginning. The corrected code compiles without errors.
