The error message indicates that there is an extra newline character at the end of the string literal in the `fmt.Printf()` function call, which is causing a syntax error. The fix for this error is to remove the extra newline character from the string.
Here's the corrected code:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
 var a, b int
 fmt.Println("Enter two integers:")
 fmt.Scan(&a, &b)
 if b == 0 {
 fmt.Println("Error: Division by zero")
 return
 }
 sum := a + b
 diff := a - b
 prod := a * b
 quot := a / b // Truncates towards zero (in C99)
 rem := a % b // Remainder has the same sign as the first operand (in C99)
 exp := int(float64(a) / float64(b)) // Exponentiation in Golang is floating-point division
 fmt.Printf("Sum: %d, Difference: %d, Product: %d, Quotient: %d, Remainder: %d, Exponentiation: %d
", sum, diff, prod, quot, rem, exp)
}
```
This code should now compile and produce the desired output.
