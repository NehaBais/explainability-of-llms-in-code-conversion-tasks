 The error occurs because the linker is unable to find the entry point of execution for the program, which is "_main". This symbol is mandatory by the C++ language standard and it's not present in the provided code snippet. 

The fix would be to add a main() function in your C++ code. The main() function is the entry point of an application or a library and is where control begins after initialization. In other words, every C++ program must contain at least one instance of the main() function. If it doesn't, you will get this linker error.

Here's how to fix the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int a = 10, b = 3; // Example values for a and b
    bitwise(a, b);
}

void bitwise(int a, int b) {
  cout << "a AND b: " << (a & b) << endl;
  cout << "a OR b: " << (a | b) << endl;
  cout << "a XOR b: " << (a ^ b) << endl;
  cout << "NOT a: " << ~a << endl;
  cout << "a << b: " << (a << b) << endl; // left shift
  cout << "a >> b: " << (a >> b) << endl; // arithmetic right shift
  cout << "a >>> b: " << (a >> b) << endl; // logical right shift
}
```
This code is properly linked and has a main function. Now the bitwise() function can be executed, which will perform all the bitwise operations on the integer values `a` and `b`.
