The error message indicates that there are undeclared identifiers "｜begin▁of▁sentence｜", which are likely not part of the original Python script, or they have been removed in translation to C. 

To fix this issue, we would need to review the C code and ensure all necessary variables/identifiers are declared properly before using them. This includes checking for missing characters like "｜begin▁of▁sentence｜". 

The corrected C code will likely look something like this:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void compare(char *a, char *b) {
    printf("'%s' is of type %s and '%s' is of type %s\n", a,
           (strcmp(a, b) == 0) ? "String" : "Non-string", 
           b,
           (strlen(b) != 1 && strlen(b)) ? "String" : "Non-string");
  
    if (strcmp(a, b) < 0) {
        printf("'%s' is strictly less than '%s'\n", a, b);
    }
    if (strcmp(a, b) <= 0) {
        printf("'%s' is lexically less or equal to '%s'\n", a, b);
    }
    if (strcmp(a, b) > 0) {
        printf("'%s' is strictly greater than '%s'\n", a, b);
    }
    if (strcmp(a, b) >= 0) {
        printf("'%s' is lexically greater or equal to '%s'\n", a, b);
    }
}
  
int main() {
    compare("YUP", "YUP");  // Compare two same string. Output will be: "'YUP' is of type String and 'YUP' is of type Non-string"
    compare("BALL", "BELL");  // Compare BALL and BELL, so output will be: "'BALL' is strictly greater than 'BELL'"
    compare("24", "123");  // Compare 24 and 123, so output will be: "'24' is strictly less than '123'"
    return 0;  // indicates success of main function. Equivalent to python's sys.exit(0)
}
```
In this corrected version, we use the strcmp() function to compare two strings lexicographically and print appropriate messages based on the result of comparison in if-else statements. The 'main' function is used as an entry point for our program which calls the 'compare' function with different string inputs.
