The error message indicates that there is a type mismatch between the two arguments passed to the `pow` method of the `i32` type. The `pow` method expects an argument of type `u32`, but the `input2` variable is declared as an `i32`. To fix this, you can convert the `input2` variable to a `u32` using the `try_into` method and handle any errors that may occur during the conversion.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
let exponentiation = input1.pow(input2 as u32);
```
This will ensure that the two arguments passed to the `pow` method have the same type, and the code should compile without errors.
