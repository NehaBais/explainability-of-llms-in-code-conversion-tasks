The error message indicates that the crate name cannot contain a period. The name of the crate must be alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) without any special characters like periods or underscores.

To fix this issue, you can change the crate name from `qwen2.5coder2b_logic_ops_cpp_rs` to something that does not contain a dot.

The corrected code block should look like this:

```rust
// Define the function print_logic with two boolean arguments
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    // Print the result of "and" on both arguments
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    
    // Print the result of "or" on both arguments
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    
    // Print the result of "not" on the first argument
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
```

This code correctly implements the logic operations as required and prints the results to standard output.
