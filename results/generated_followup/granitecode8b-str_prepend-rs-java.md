The error is due to the fact that Java 17 does not yet support implicitly declared classes, which are preview features. To fix this, we need to enable the `--enable-preview` flag when compiling the code. Once this is done, we can declare a `String` variable using the `var` keyword and concatenate two string literals using the `+` operator.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
var s = "World";
s = "Hello " + s;
System.out.println(s);
```
