The error message indicates that the linker cannot find the `main` function, which is required for any C or C++ program to be executable. 

In C/C++, the main entry point of a program is indicated by the "main" function. The compiler will use this as an anchor when linking all other functions and variables together into a single binary that can run on the target machine.

To fix the error, define your own `main` function:
```c
int main() {
    int a = 10;  // example values for testing
    int b = 2;   // example values for testing
    bitwise(a, b);
    return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>0; // standard convention for successful program execution
}
```
Now the `main` function is defined and the linker can find it. The program will compile successfully. This main function invokes the custom bitwise function with example integer arguments (10 and 2). It then returns from the `main` method indicating a successful completion of the program execution.
