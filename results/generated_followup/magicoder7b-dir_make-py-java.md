The error is caused by Java's new feature of implicitly declared classes. It requires the `--enable-preview` flag to compile the file. 

This will enable the implicit declaration feature and hence you wouldn't see this error.

Corrected Code:
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;

public void mkdirp(String path) throws IOException {
    Files.createDirectories(Paths.get(path));
}
```
This is the corrected code for creating a directory in Java, including any missing parent directories. It throws an `IOException` if it cannot create the directory due to a filesystem error (e.g., permission denied).
