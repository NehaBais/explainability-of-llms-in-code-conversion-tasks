The error occurs because there is no main function in the C++ code enclosed within backticks. To fix this, we need to create a main function that calls our `factors` function and prints out its result. 

To fix the linker error, we need to link our C++ code with any necessary dependencies. In this case, we only need the `<iostream>` header file included in `main`. By adding this line of code `#include <iostream>`, the error should be resolved and the program should run successfully.

Here's the corrected single-code block:
```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<int> factors(int num) {
  std::vector<int> n_factors;
  int i;

  for  (i = 1; i <= sqrt(num); i++)
    if  (num % i == 0) {
      n_factors.push_back(i);
      if  (num / i != i)
        n_factors.push_back(num / i);
     }
  std::sort(n_factors.begin(), n_factors.end());  // numeric sort
  return n_factors;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> result = factors(45);

    for (const auto& factor : result)
        std::cout << factor << ' ';

    return 0;
}
```
