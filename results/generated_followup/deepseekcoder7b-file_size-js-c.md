The error message is indicating that there are some syntax errors, as well as some warnings related to undeclared identifiers and format specifiers. 

The fix for this would be to replace `st.st<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜> t_size);` with `st.st_size);` since `st_size` is the correct member of the struct that contains the size information of a file. Also, remove all occurrences of '|', and unicode characters from the code as these are causing errors or warnings.

Here's the corrected C code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  struct stat st;

   // Verify the size of a file called input.txt for current working directory
  if (stat("input.txt", &st) == 0) {
    printf("Size of 'input.txt' in current working directory: %ld\n", st.st_size);
  } else {
    printf("Cannot get size of file input.txt for current working directory");
  }

   // Verify the size of a file called input.txt for root file system
  if (stat("/home/user/input.txt", &st) == 0) {
    printf("Size of 'input.txt' at the root of file system: %ld\n", st.st_size);
  } else {
    printf("Cannot get size of file input.txt for root of file system");
  }

  return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜> tatus 0;
}
```
