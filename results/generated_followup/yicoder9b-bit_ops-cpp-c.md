The error message indicates that the symbol `main`, which is the entry point of any C program, was not found when linking the executable file. The fix for this issue is to define a main function in your code. 

Here's how you could rewrite the corrected code:

```c
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a = /*insert first integer here*/;
  int b = /*insert second integer here*/;
  printf("a and b: %d\n", (a & b));
  printf("a or b:  %d\n", (a | b));
  printf("a xor b: %d\n", (a ^ b));
  printf("not a:   %d\n", ~a);

  // Note that the C/C++ shift operators are not guaranteed to work if
  // the shift count is negative or >= number of bits in integer.
  printf("a shl b: %d\n", (a << b));

  int num_bits = CHAR_BIT * sizeof(int);
  b %= num_bits; // ensure that rotate amount is within [0,num_bits)

  unsigned int ua = a;
  printf("a lsr b: %d\n", (ua >> b));

  // there are no rotation operators in C. You can implement them yourself
  unsigned int mask = (1 << num_bits) - 1; // all ones
  printf("a rol b: %u\n", ((ua << b) | (ua >> (num_bits - b))) & mask);
  printf("a ror b: %u\n", ((ua >> b) | (ua << (num_bits - b))) & mask);
  return 0; // indicate that the program has ended successfully.
}
```
