Error explanation:
There are 13 errors generated, all related to template specialization for `basic_istream` not being able to match against `'basic_ostream'`. This is because there is no implementation of `operator>>(ostream&, int)` in the standard library.

Fix:
To fix this issue, you can provide a custom implementation of `operator>>` for `int`:

Corrected code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& is, int& n) {
    is >> std::ws;
    if (is.fail()) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to read integer value"));
    }
    n = static_cast<int>(is.get()))();
    return is;
}
```

This custom implementation reads an integer value from the input stream and returns it. This should resolve the error caused by missing template specialization for `operator>>` in the standard library.
