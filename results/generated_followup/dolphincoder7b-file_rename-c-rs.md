The error is related to the `std::os` module in Rust that provides various operating system-specific functionality and does not include the function `rename`. The correct approach is to use the `std::fs::rename` function from the standard library's `std::fs` module. To rename a file, we need to import this function using the `use std::fs::rename;` statement.

Here is the corrected code:

```rust
use std::fs::rename;

fn main() {
    let  _result = rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    let  _result = rename("docs", "mydocs");

     // Assuming you have the permissions to access "/input.txt" and "/docs".
    let  _result = rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    let  _result = rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
}
```
