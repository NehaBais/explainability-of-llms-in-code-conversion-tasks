The error is caused by missing header files and implicit type declarations. The fix is to include the `<string.h>` header file and use the appropriate type declarations.

```c
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char *s = strdup("World");
    strncat(s, "Hello ", 7);
    printf("%s\n", s);

    free(s);

    return 0;
}
```
