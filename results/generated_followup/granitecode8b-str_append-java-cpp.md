The error message indicates that there are missing include statements for the required header files. 

Once we have added these includes, the code should compile without errors. Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
  string string = "abc";
  cout << string << endl;
  string += "def";
  cout << string << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
