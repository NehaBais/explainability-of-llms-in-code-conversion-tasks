The error message indicates that there are several errors in the C code, and it also warns about some warnings that may not be necessary for this task. The first two errors occur because the `printf` and `scanf` functions are not declared in the standard library header file `<stdio.h>`, so we need to include it explicitly or provide a declaration for these functions.
The last four errors occur because there is a missing terminating character for some strings, which causes the compiler to report an error. To fix this, we can add the missing characters manually.
To rewrite the corrected code in a single fenced code block, we can simply copy and paste the corrected code from the previous response. Here it is:
```c
#include 
int main() {
  int a, b;
  printf("Enter two integers: ");
  scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
  printf("a+b = %d
", a + b);
  printf("a-b = %d
", a - b);
  printf("a*b = %d
", a * b);
  int quotient = a / b;
  int remainder = a % b;
  printf("a/b = %d, remainder %d
", quotient, remainder);
  return 0;
}
```
