The error `SyntaxError: unmatched ')` is caused by an incorrect use of parentheses in the Python code provided. Specifically, there is an extra closing parenthesis ')' at the end of the line where `os.chmod("output.txt", stat.S_IRUSR 
| stat.S_IWUSR 
| stat.S_IRGRP 
| stat.S_IWGRP))` is used to set file permissions for "output.txt". 

To fix this issue, we simply need to remove the extra closing parenthesis at the end of the line. Here's the corrected code:
```python
import os
import stat


with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    pass

os.chmod(
    "output.txt", 
    stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IWUSR | stat.S_IRGRP | stat.S_IWGRP)
```
In this corrected code, we have removed the extra closing parenthesis at the end of the line where `os.chmod("output.txt", stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IWUSR | stat.S_IRGRP | stat.S_IWGRP))` is used to set file permissions for "output.txt".
