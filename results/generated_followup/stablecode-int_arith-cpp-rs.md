The error is caused by an unclosed delimiter (`(`) at line 3, column 11. This means that there is a missing opening parenthesis at this location in the code.

To fix this issue, we need to add an opening parenthesis before `fn main()`. This will ensure that the first argument of the function `main()` has been properly parsed from the input string into an integer type (`i32`) in Rust. The corrected code is as follows:
```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let mut a = String::new();
    println!("Enter first integer:");
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut a)).expect("Failed to read line");

    let mut b = String::new();
    println!("Enter second integer:");
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut b)).expect("Failed to read line");

    let a: i32 	= match a.trim().parse() 		 {
					Ok(num) 	=> num,
					Err(_) 		=> panic!("Invalid input"),
			};

		    let b: i32 	= match b.trim().parse() 		 {
					Ok(num) 	=> num,
					Err(_) 		=> panic!("Invalid input"),
			};

    println!("a+b 	= {}", a + b);
    println!("a-b 	= {}", a - b);
    println!("a*b 	= {}", a * b);
    println!("a/b 	= {:.2}, remainder 	= {}", a as f32 / b as f32, (a % b).abs());
}
```
