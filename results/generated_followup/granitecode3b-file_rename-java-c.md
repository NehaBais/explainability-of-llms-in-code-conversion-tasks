The error is that the `rename` function is not supported in C99 or later versions of the language. To fix this, the `perror` function is used to print an error message if the rename fails. The `printf` function is also used to display a success message when the rename is successful.
The corrected code is as follows:
```c
#include 
int main() {
  char oldname[] = "input.txt";
  char newname[] = "output.txt";
  int success;
  // Rename file (or directory)
  success = rename(oldname, newname);
  if (success != 0) {
    perror("Rename failed");
  } else {
    printf("File renamed successfully\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The error in the original code is that the `rename` function is not supported in C99 or later versions of the language. The fix is to use the `perror` and `printf` functions to print an error message if the rename fails, and a success message when the rename is successful.
