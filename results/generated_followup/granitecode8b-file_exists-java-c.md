The error message indicates that the compiler does not recognize the `access()` function, which is part of the C standard library. To fix this, you need to include the appropriate header file that declares the `access()` function. The fix for this issue is to add `#include  before the first use of the `access()` function in the code.
Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include
int main() {
  // Verifying if a file called input.txt and a directory called docs exist in
  // the current working directory
  if (access("docs/input.txt", F_OK) != -1) {
    printf("File and directory exists in the current working directoryn");
  } else {
    printf(
        "File or directory does not exist in the current working directoryn");
  }

  // Verifying if a file called input.txt and a directory called docs exist in
  // the filesystem root
  if (access("/docs/input.txt", F_OK) != -1) {
    printf("File and directory exists in the filesystem rootn");
  } else {
    printf("File or directory does not exist in the filesystem rootn");
  }

  return 0;
}
```
