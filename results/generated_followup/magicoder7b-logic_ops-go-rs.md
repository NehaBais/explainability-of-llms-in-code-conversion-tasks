 The error occurs because Rust is a compiled language, while Go is interpreted. When you compile the Rust function into an executable file for use in other programs, the `main` function is necessary to allow execution of the program. However, your Go function does not contain a `main` function and therefore cannot be directly translated into a standalone Rust binary.

The fixed code in single line would look like this:
```rs
fn main() { print_logic(true, false); }

fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
```
In this corrected code, the `main` function calls your `print_logic` function with some sample parameters. This can be modified as per your needs and will allow Rust binary to run and execute these functions.
