The error occurred because the C++ compiler was unable to find the `iostream` library, which contains the `cout` object used in the JavaScript function. The fix was to include the `iostream` library at the beginning of the C++ file using the `#include` directive.
Here is the corrected code in a single fenced code block:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
void bitwise(int a, int b) {
  cout << "a AND b: " << (a & b) << endl;
  cout << "a OR b: " << (a | b) << endl;
  cout << "a XOR b: " << (a ^ b) << endl;
  cout << "NOT a: " << ~a << endl;
  cout << "a << b: " << (a << b) << endl;  // left shift
  cout << "a >> b: " << (a >> b) << endl;  // arithmetic right shift
  cout << "a >>> b: " << (a >> b) << endl; // logical right shift
}
int main() {
  int a = 10, b = 3;
  bitwise(a, b);
  return 0;
}
```
