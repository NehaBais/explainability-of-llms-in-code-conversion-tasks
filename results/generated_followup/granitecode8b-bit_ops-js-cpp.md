The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the identifiers `cout` and `endl`. These are standard C++ output stream functions, so they need to be included in the program. The fix is to add `#include  using namespace std;` at the top of the file. This will ensure that the compiler can find these identifiers.
Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include  using namespace std;
void bitwise(int a, int b) {
  cout << "a AND b: " << (a & b) << endl;
  cout << "a OR b: " << (a | b) << endl;
  cout << "a XOR b: " << (a ^ b) << endl;
  cout << "NOT a: " << ~a << endl;
  cout << "a << b: " << (a << b) << endl;   // left shift
  cout << "a >> b: " << (a >> b) << endl;   // arithmetic right shift
  cout << "a >>> b: " << (a >>> b) << endl; // logical right shift
}
```
This code includes the necessary header file and uses the `std` namespace to avoid having to prefix standard library identifiers with `std::`. It also uses `endl` instead of `rn` to insert a newline character after each output statement.
