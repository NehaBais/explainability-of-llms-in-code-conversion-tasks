 The error occurs because the C compiler is looking for a symbol (function name) called "main" but can't find it. Since the program you provided doesn’t have a main function, this is why the linker cannot find it. 

To fix the issue, add `int main() {…}` to your code. This function is the entry point for any C program, which means that without it, the compiler has no idea where to start executing your program. 

Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10; // Set any example values for 'a' and 'b'.
    int b = 2;  
    
    bitwise(a, b);
    
    return 0;
}

void bitwise(int a, int b) {
    ... (same as the provided code)
}
```
