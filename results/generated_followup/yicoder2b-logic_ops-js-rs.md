This error indicates that the `main` function is not found when compiling using the `yicoder2b-logic_ops_js_rs` crate. To fix this, you need to add a main function to your Rust program. The rustc compiler can only compile files that start with a main function (unless they are in an executable crate).

Adding the following line to your `/tmp/yicoder2b-logic_ops-js-rs.rs` file will fix this issue: 
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut a = true;
    let mut b = false;
    logic(a, b);
}
```
Replace `true` and `false` with the actual values you are using. This is because `mut` allows to change these variables' value as they will be modified by your function `logic()`. 

For more context about why `#[warn(unused_mut)]` is recommended, see this issue on Github: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5890.
