The error in a single line is: `error: mismatched closing delimiter: `)``

Fix: To fix this, we need to ensure that each opening delimiter has a corresponding closing delimiter. In this case, the function definition for `compare` is missing its parameter names. By adding parameter names (`a` and `b`) to the function definition, the mismatched closing delimiter error will be resolved.

Corrected code:
```rust
fn compare(a: &str, b: &str) -> bool {
    a.eq_ignore_ascii_whitespace(b)
}
```
