The error message states that Rust cannot find the value `First` because it is not defined in this scope, which means the variable's name has been misspelled or it hasn't been initialized yet.

To fix this issue, simply change "First" to "first". In Rust, variable names are case-sensitive.

Here's the corrected code:
```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Enter two integers");

    let mut first = String::new();
    let mut Second = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut First)
        .expect("Failed to read line");
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut Second)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let first: i32 = match First.trim().parse() {
        Ok(num) => num,
        Err(_) => panic!("Please type a number!"),
    };

    let Second: i32 = match Second.trim().parse() {
        Ok(num) => num,
        Err(_) => panic!("Please type a number!"),
    };

    println!("The sum is {}", First + Second);
    println!("The difference is {}", First - Second);
    println!("The product is {}", First * Second);
    println!("The integer quotient is {}", First / Second);
    println!("The remainder is {}", First % Second);
}
```
