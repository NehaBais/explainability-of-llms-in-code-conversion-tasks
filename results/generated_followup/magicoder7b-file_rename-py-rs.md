 The error "expected item, found keyword `let`" arises because Rust requires that every statement (in this case, function calls) have an expression to compute a value. In this context, 'let' is considered a keyword, not an expression, which causes the parser to become confused.

Here's how you can fix it:

```rs
use std::fs;

// Current working directory.
let _ = fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").unwrap();
let _ = fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").unwrap();

// Filesystem root.
let _ = fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt").unwrap();
let _ = fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs").unwrap();
```

In Rust, each line of code must end with a semi-colon(;). As such, we have to split our commands over two lines if we don't want to end every line with a semicolon. This is why 'let' wasn't recognized as an expression, but rather a keyword. Hence, the parser got confused and produced an error.
