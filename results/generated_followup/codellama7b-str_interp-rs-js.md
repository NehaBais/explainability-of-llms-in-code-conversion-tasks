The error is caused by the missing closing parenthesis on the last argument of the `console.log` function, which is missing the `)` at the end of the string.

Here's the corrected code:
```js
function main() {
  console.log("Mary had a " + little" lamb");
  // You can specify order
  console.log(+ "had a " + Mary" lamb", "little", "Mary");
  // Or named arguments if you prefer
  console.log({name: "Mary", adj: "little"} "had a {adj} lamb", name="Mary");
}
```
