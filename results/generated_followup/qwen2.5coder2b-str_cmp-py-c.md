The error message indicates that the compiler does not recognize the `strcmp` function, which is part of the C Standard Library. This function checks for equality between two strings, returning -1 if a is less than b, 0 if they are equal, and 1 if a is greater than b.

To fix this issue, you need to include the `<string.h>` header file. This library contains the `strcmp` function and other string manipulation functions that you can use in your C program.

```c
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void compare(const char *a, const char *b) {
  printf("%s is of type %s and %s is of type %s\n", a,
         (a != NULL) ? "string" : "NULL", b, (b != NULL) ? "string" : "NULL");

  if (strcmp(a, b) < 0) {
    printf("%s is strictly less than %s\n", a, b);
  } else if (strcmp(a, b) == 0) {
    printf("%s is equal to %s\n", a, b);
  } else if (strcmp(a, b) > 0) {
    printf("%s is strictly greater than %s\n", a, b);
  }
}

int main() {
  compare("YUP", "YUP");
  compare("BALL", "BELL");
  compare("24", "123");
  compare(24, 123);
  compare(5.0, 5);

  return 0;
}
```
This code includes the `<string.h>` library, which provides `strcmp` and other functions required to perform string comparisons in C.
