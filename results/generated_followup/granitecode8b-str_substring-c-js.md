The error in the code is that the `in` parameter in the `str_fromstr` function is declared as an input parameter, but it is not used within the function body. This causes a syntax error when the code is run.
To fix this error, we need to use the `in` keyword instead of `in` as the variable name.
Here is the corrected code:
```js
function str_fromstr(s, inStr, m) {
  let index = s.indexOf(inStr);
  if (index === -1) {
    return null;
  }
  return substring(s, index - n, m);
}
```
In this corrected code, the `in` keyword is used instead of `in` as the variable name to avoid a syntax error. The `indexOf` method is then used to find the index of the input string within the original string. If the input string is not found, `null` is returned. Otherwise, the `substring` function is called with the appropriate parameters to extract the substring.
