The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the `boost/filesystem.hpp` file, which is typically included when using Boost libraries with C++. You might have not installed or correctly set up the Boost library in your development environment. 

To fix this issue you should include the correct paths to the Boost header files in your compiler settings. In some Linux distributions and editors like CLion, VS Code, etc., setting the BOOST_ROOT environment variable usually works fine. If it doesn't work for your case, you might need to explicitly specify the path during compilation with `-I/path/to/boost` flag.

Here is how you could rewrite and correct the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <filesystem>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;

void create_directory(const std::string &path) 
{
    fs::path dir(path);
    
    if (!fs::exists(dir))
    {
        if (fs::create_directories(dir))
            std::cout << "Path successfully created" << std::endl;
    } 
}

int main() 
{
    create_directory("C:/parent/test");
    return 0;
}
```
