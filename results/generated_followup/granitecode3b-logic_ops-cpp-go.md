The error message indicates that there is a syntax error in the C++ code, specifically at the end of each statement. The error messages for each line are as follows:
- Line 10: syntax error: unexpected name or at end of statement
- Line 11: syntax error: unexpected name a at end of statement
- Line 12: syntax error: unexpected name and at end of statement
- Line 13: syntax error: unexpected name or at end of statement
- Line 14: syntax error: unexpected name a at end of statement
The fix for these errors is to remove the extra characters before the name. The corrected code is as follows:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func printLogic(a bool, b bool) {
 fmt.Printf("a and b is %v\n", a && b)
 fmt.Printf("a or b is %v\n", a || b)
 fmt.Printf("not a is %v\n", !a)
}
func main() {
 printLogic(true, true) // Output: a and b is true 
a or b is true 
not a is false 
 a and b is false 
a or b is true 
not a is true
```
