Error: This method takes 1 argument but 2 arguments were supplied at `s2.find(&s3, next_loc)`.

Fix: Remove the extra argument from `s2.find(&s3, next_loc)` to make it `s2.find(&s3)`.

Corrected code:
```rs
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("abcd");
    let s2 = String::from("abab");
    let s3 = String::from("ab");

    //Beginning
    if s1.starts_with(&s3) {
        println!("The first string starts with the second string");
    }

    //End
    if s1.ends_with(&s3) {
        println!("The first string ends with the second string");
    }

    //Anywhere
    if let Some(loc) = s2.find(&s3) {
        println!(
            "The first string contains the second string at location {}",
            loc
        );
        let mut next_loc = loc + 1;
        while let Some(found_at) = s2.find(&s3, next_loc) {
            println!("Occurrence found at position: {}", found_at);
            next_loc = found_at + 1;
        }
    } else {
        println!("The first string does not contain the second string");
    }
}
```
