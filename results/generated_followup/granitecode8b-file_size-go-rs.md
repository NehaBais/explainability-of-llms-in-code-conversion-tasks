The error message indicates that there is no method named `size` found for the `Metadata` struct in the current scope. This means that the `size()` method, which returns the size of a file in bytes, is not available in the current namespace. To fix this issue, you can import the `MetadataExt` trait, which provides the `size()` method, by adding `use std::os::unix::fs::MetadataExt;` to the top of the code.
Here's the corrected code:
```rs
use std::os::unix::fs::MetadataExt;
fn print_file_size(f: &str) {
    if let Ok(stat) = std::fs::metadata(f) {
        println!("{}", stat.size());
    } else {
        eprintln!("Error getting file size");
    }
}
fn main() {
    print_file_size("input.txt");
    print_file_size("/input.txt");
}
```
Note that the `blksize()` method is also available in the `MetadataExt` trait, but it returns the block size of the file instead of its size. If you need to access both the size and the block size of a file, you should import both traits: `use std::os::unix::fs::{MetadataExt, Stat};`.
