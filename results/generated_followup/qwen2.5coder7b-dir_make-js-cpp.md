The error occurs because the Boost.Filesystem library is not installed on your system, or it is not included in the compiler's search path.

To fix this, you need to install the Boost library or ensure that the include path for Boost is correctly specified when compiling the program.

Here is the corrected code using Boost.Filesystem:

```cpp
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>
#include <iostream>

// Function to create directory with parents if they don't exist
void mkdirp(const std::string &p) {
  try {
    boost::filesystem::path dirPath(p);
    // Create the directory and its parents if they don't exist
    if (boost::filesystem::create_directories(dirPath)) {
      std::cout << "Directory created successfully: " << p << std::endl;
    } else {
      std::cout << "Directory already exists or could not be created: " << p
                << std::endl;
    }
  } catch (const boost::filesystem::filesystem_error &e) {
    // Handle any errors during directory creation
    std::cerr << "Filesystem error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  // Example usage of mkdirp function
  std::string path = "./path/to/dir";
  mkdirp(path);
  return 0;
}
```

If you encounter issues with Boost not being found during compilation, ensure that the Boost headers are installed and accessible in your compiler's include path.
