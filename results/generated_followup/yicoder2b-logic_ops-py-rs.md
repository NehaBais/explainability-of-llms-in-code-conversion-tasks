This error indicates that the `main` function is not found when compiling using the `yicoder2b-logic_ops_py_rs` crate. To resolve this issue, you need to define a main function in your Rust program. In Python, functions can be nested within a module (or class, depending on your use case), but Rust does not have the concept of "functions inside functions" like Python does. Instead, a main function is required at the top level of any Rust program.

The error could also indicate that `a` and `b` are mutable variables, which means they can be changed after being defined in the function. In Rust, it's generally a good idea to avoid mutable variables unless you know exactly what you're doing - because once you change them, you don't necessarily know where the variable was before the change. If `a` and `b` should not be mutated outside of the function (for instance if they are passed to other functions), you must declare them as immutable.

Here is the corrected Rust code:

```rs
fn logic(mut a: bool, mut b: bool) {
    println!("a and b: {:?}", &(a && b));
    println!("a or b: {:?}", &(a || b));
    println!("not a: {:?}", !a);
}
```

The `&` before the expression tells Rust to dereference the boolean value, which makes it printable. This is because in Rust, booleans are represented as integers `0` and `1`. So &b means get the boolean value of b (and dereference it) and print it.
