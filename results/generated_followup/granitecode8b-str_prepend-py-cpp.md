The error in the converted code is that it is missing the necessary header file for string manipulation, which is `"#include 
"`. The fix is to add this header file at the beginning of the code.
Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
 string s = "12345678";
 s = "0" + s; // by concatenation
 cout << s << endl;
 return 0;
}
```
