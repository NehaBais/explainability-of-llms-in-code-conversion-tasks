The error message indicates that the compiler is unable to find the `strcpy()`, `strcat()`, and `printf()` functions, which are part of the C standard library. To fix this, you need to include the appropriate header files (`string.h` and `stdio.h`) at the beginning of your code and declare the functions explicitly. Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 char s[12];
 strcpy(s, "World");
 strcat(s, ", Hello ");
 printf("%s", s);
 return 0;
}
```
Note that I've also increased the size of the `s` array to accommodate the additional text added by `strcat()`. Additionally, you may need to adjust the buffer size depending on your specific use case.
