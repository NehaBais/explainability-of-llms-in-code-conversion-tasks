The error message indicates that there are some syntax issues with the provided C++ code, specifically with the return statement which is not valid in this context. 

In order to fix it, we can just remove the `return` statement as it's not required here and will cause compile errors:

Here is the corrected version of your code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::string extra = "little";
  std::string str = "Mary had a X lamb.";

  size_t pos = 0;
  while ((pos = str.find("X", pos)) != std::string::npos) {
    str.replace(pos, 1, extra);
    pos += extra.size();
   }

  std::cout << str;
}
```
