Error:
- The compiler is unable to find the required headers for `std::string` and `std::cout`.
- It also warns that it has implicitly used the `std` namespace, which can lead to confusion.
Fix:
- Install the necessary headers by running `sudo apt install libboost-all-dev` on Ubuntu.
- Remove the `using namespace std;` line as it is not needed in C++.
Rewritten code:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
int main() {
  std::string s = "World";
  s = "Hello " + s;
  std::cout << s << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
