The error is that `System.out.println()` does not support variadic methods (i.e., it cannot take a variable number of arguments like `%s` does). Instead, we can use `String.format()`, which allows us to specify the format and arguments in separate arguments.

Here's how you can rewrite the corrected code:

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String extra = "little";
    System.out.println("Mary had a %s lamb.", String.format("%s", extra));
  }
}
```

This will correctly print "Mary had a little lamb."
