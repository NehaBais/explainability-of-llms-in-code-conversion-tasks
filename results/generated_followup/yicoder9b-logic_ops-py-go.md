The error occurs because there is no declared function named `main` which acts as the entry point for Go programs, but it is required in this case.

A single line fix would be to declare a main function and call our logic function inside of it: 
```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
)
func logic(a bool, b bool) {
	fmt.Println("a and b:", a && b)
	fmt.Println("a or b:", a || b)
	fmt.Println("not a:", !a)
}
func main() {
    logic(true, false)
}
```
In this code block, we have added `main()` function and called the logic function within it with boolean arguments true and false. This makes sure that our program has an entry point to start running the program which is required in Go programming language.
