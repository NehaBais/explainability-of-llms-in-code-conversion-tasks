The error in the JavaScript code is due to using 'import' statement before defining package which is not allowed in JavaScript. The fix for it would be to define a package at the beginning of the file. After that, you can use the imported modules like os and fmt in your program. Similarly, in Golang there are no import statements unlike JavaScript so we need to provide path to each file using absolute paths.

Here is the corrected Golang code:
```go
package main
import (
	"os"
	"fmt"
)
func main() {
	file, err := os.Open("input.txt") // Open file "input.txt" in current directory
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Failed to open file: %s\n", err)
		return
	} else {
		defer file.Close()
		info := file.Fstat() // Get information about the file
		size := info.Size  // Get size of the file in bytes
		fmt.Printf("The size of input.txt is %d bytes\n", size)
	}

	file, err := os.Open("c:/input.txt") // Open "c:/input.txt" which exists on disk
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Failed to open file: %s\n", err)
		return
	} else {
		defer file.Close()
		info := file.Fstat() // Get information about the file
		size := info.Size  // Get size of the file in bytes
		fmt.Printf("The size of c:/input.txt is %d bytes\n", size)
	}
}
```
