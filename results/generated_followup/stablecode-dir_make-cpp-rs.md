The error can be explained as "main" function not found in crate" which means that Rust couldn't find any main function to start running the program.

The fix for this issue is to add a main function with no arguments and returns no value. This ensures that the program knows where to start executing the code.

Here's the corrected code:
```rs
fn create_directories(path_to_create: &str) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
    let path = path_to_create;

    match fs::create_dir_all(path) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(()),
        Err(e) => Err(e),
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Call the create_directories function with a specific path string.
    let path = "./path/to/directory";
    match create_directories(&path)) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Successfully created directories."),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error occurred while creating directories: {}", e),
    }
}
```
In this corrected code, the main function is added at the end of the file. This main function calls the `create_directories()` function with a specific path string as its argument. The result of this function call is then checked using a match expression to handle both the successful directory creation and any errors that might occur during the process.

The corrected code ensures that the program'
s execution will continue to the next statement after the `main()
function, which will be the closing curly brace (`}`) of the main function. This ensures that the program starts executing the code from the next statement after the `main()` function.
