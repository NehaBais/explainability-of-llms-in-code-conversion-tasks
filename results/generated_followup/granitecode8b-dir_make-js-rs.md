The error is that the `main` function is not found by the compiler, as it is not included in this code snippet. The Rust compiler requires a `main` function to be present in order to run the program.
To fix this, you can add a `main` function to the code snippet and provide an empty body for it.

After adding the `main` function, the corrected code will look like this:
```rs
use std::fs;
use std::io;
fn mkdirp(path: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
 fs::create_dir_all(path)
}
fn main() {}
```
This code creates a directory and any missing parents using the `std::fs` module in Rust. The `mkdirp` function takes a single path string as input and has the side-effect of creating directories if they do not already exist. If the directory already exists, the function will return successfully without doing anything.
