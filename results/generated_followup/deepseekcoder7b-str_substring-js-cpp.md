The error occurs because of incorrect syntax used for returning an integer value from `main()` function in C++, which is not allowed as per the language specification. It seems like there's a Unicode character or some other non-standard symbol interfering with proper compilation. 

Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string str = "abcdefgh";
    int n = 2, m = 3;
  
    // starting from n characters in and of m length;
    cout << str.substr(n, m) << endl;  //  "cde"
  
    // starting from n characters in, up to the end of the string;
    cout << str.substr(n) << endl;      //  "cdefgh"
  
    // whole string minus last character;
    cout << str.substr(0, str.length() - 1) << endl;     //  "abcdefg"
  
    // starting from a known character within the string and of m length;
    cout << str.substr(str.find('b'), m) << endl;      //  "bcd"
  
    // starting from a known substring within the string and of m length;
    cout << str.substr(str.find("bc"), m) << endl;       //  "bcd"
  
    return 0;
}
```
In this corrected code, `return 0` has been used at the end to signify successful completion of the program execution in C++. The rest of the code remains unchanged as it is already a valid C++ snippet for string operations with substrings and find methods.
