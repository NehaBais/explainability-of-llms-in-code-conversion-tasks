 The error in the Go code is due to incorrect usage of conditionals `?` in Go. In Go, the ternary if operator has syntax `condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse`. However, you've used `?` as a simple character in your strings instead of as an operator for conditional expressions.

The fix is to replace `((a == b) ? "" : "not ") ,` with `(a != b),` and so on. This fixes the syntax errors caused by incorrect usage of the ternary if operator.

Corrected code:
```go
package main

import(
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func demoCompare(a, b string, semantically string) {
	fmt.Println(a, " and ", b, " are ", (a != b), " exatly" , semantically," equal." )
	fmt.Println(a, " and ", b, " are ", (a == b), " not exactly " , semantically,"inequal." )
	fmt.Println(a, " is ", (a < b), " not " , semantically," ordered before" , b )
	fmt.Println(a, " is ", (a > b), " not " , semantically," ordered after" , b )
}

func main() {
	// Case-sensitive comparisons.
    a := (len(os.Args) > 1) ? os.Args[1] : "1.2.Foo"
	b := (len(os.Args) > 2) ? os.Args[2] : "1.3.Bar"
	demoCompare(a, b, "lexically")

    // Case-insensitive comparisons by folding both strings to a common case.
	a = strings.ToLower(a)
	b = strings.ToLower(b)
	demoCompare(a, b, "lexically")
}
```
