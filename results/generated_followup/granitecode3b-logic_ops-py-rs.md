Error: The `main` function is not found in the crate `granitecode3b_logic_ops_py_rs`.
Fix: Add a `main` function to the crate with the same name as the file.
Corrected Code:
```rust
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a || b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);
}

fn main() {
 logic(true, false);
}
``` 
Explanation: The error occurred because the `main` function is not found in the crate. To fix this, add a `main` function to the crate with the same name as the file. This will ensure that the code can be executed and run successfully.
