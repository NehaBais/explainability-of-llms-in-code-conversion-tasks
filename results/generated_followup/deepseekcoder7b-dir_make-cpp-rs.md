The error message indicates that there are unrecognized tokens at several places. This could be due to incorrect syntax used for certain statements or methods. In this case, the error is related to the usage of the `<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>` statement which seems like it was intended to mark the end of a line (in some contexts known as "here-doc" in bash), but it's not valid in Rust.

The fix would be to simply remove that line from the code, as it appears to be unneeded or incorrect usage. The `process::exit(1);` statement is also not reachable because of the previous error. It should be removed too. 

Here's the corrected version of your Rust script:

```rs
use std::env;
use std::fs;
use std::process;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    
    if args.len() != 2 {
        eprintln!("usage: mkdir <path>");
        process::exit(1);
    }

    let path_to_create = &args[1];
    
    match fs::metadata(path_to_create) {
        Ok(info) => {
            if info.is_dir() {
                println!("Directory already exists: {}", path_to_create);
            } else {
                eprintln!("Path exists but is not a directory: {}", path_to_create);
                process::exit(1);
            }
        }
        Err(_info) => {
            match fs::create_dir(&args[1]) {
                Ok(_info) => println!("Directory created at: {}", path_to_create),
                Err(error) => eprintln!("Could not create directory: {}. Reason: {}", path_to_create, error),
            }
        }
    };
}
``` 
This code should work as expected on both Linux and Windows due to Rust's cross-platform support. It will create the directory at the given path if it does not already exist. If the path is a file or another type of entry, an error message is printed and the program exits with status 1.
