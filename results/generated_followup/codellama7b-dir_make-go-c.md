The error is caused by the fact that the `main` function has not been defined, which is required to be present in any program. The linker is unable to find a definition for `main`, which results in an undefined symbol error.

To fix the issue, you can add the following code to the beginning of your program:
```c
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```
This defines a `main` function with an empty body and returns 0, indicating that the program completed successfully.
