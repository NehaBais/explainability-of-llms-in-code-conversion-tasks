The error message indicates that there are multiple issues with the code. The compiler is unable to find the header files for `stdio.h` and `stdlib.h`. Additionally, it cannot recognize some of the functions used in the code, such as `exit()` and `atoi()`. These issues can be fixed by including the appropriate header files and using the correct function names.

The corrected code is:
```cpp
#include 
#include 
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int a, b;
  if (argc < 3)
    exit(1);
  b = std::atoi(argv[--argc]);
  if (b == 0)
    exit(2);
  a = std::atoi(argv[--argc]);
  std::cout << "a+b = " << a + b << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a-b = " << a - b << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a*b = " << a * b << std::endl;
  // C99 standard: rounds towards 0 (towards negative infinity if negative)
  std::cout << "a/b = " << static_cast<double>(a) / b << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a%%b = " << a % b << std::endl;
}
```
