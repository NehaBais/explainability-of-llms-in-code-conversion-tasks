The error occurred because the `printf` function is not declared in the standard C library, so the compiler cannot find it. To fix this, you need to include the header file `<stdio.h>` or explicitly provide a declaration for `printf`. Here's the corrected code:
```c
#include 
int main() {
  int a = 1, b = 1;
  printf("a && b -> %d", a && b);
  printf("n");
  printf("a || b -> %d", a || b);
  printf("n");
  printf("a ^ b -> %d", a ^ b);
  printf("n");
  printf("!a -> %d", !a);
  return 0;
}
```
