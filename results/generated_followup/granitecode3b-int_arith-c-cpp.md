The error message indicates that there are 15 errors and 1 warning generated when compiling the C code with `g++`. The warnings indicate using implicitly-defined namespaces, while the errors indicate undeclared identifiers.

This will include the necessary headers and use the `std` namespace.
The corrected code block is:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, b;
  cout << "Enter two integers: ";
  cin >> a >> b;
  if (b == 0) {
    cout << "Error: Division by zero." << endl;
    return 1;
  }
  int sum = a + b;
  int diff = a - b;
  int prod = a * b;
  int quot = a / b; // Truncates towards zero
  int rem = a % b;  // Remainder has the same sign as the first operand
  cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;
  cout << "Difference: " << diff << endl;
  cout << "Product: " << prod << endl;
  cout << "Quotient: " << quot << endl;
  cout << "Remainder: " << rem << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This code uses the `cin` and `cout` objects to read input from the user and print output to the console. It also includes an error handling for division by zero, where it prints an error message and exits with a status of 1. The quotient is truncated towards zero using the `/` operator, while the remainder has the same sign as the first operand using the `%` operator.
