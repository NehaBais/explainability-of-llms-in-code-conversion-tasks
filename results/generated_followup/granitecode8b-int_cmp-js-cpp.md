The error in the code is that it uses `print` instead of `cout`, which is the correct function for printing to the console in C++. The fix is to replace all instances of `print` with `cout`.
Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
 int a, b;

 cout << "Enter two integers: ";
 cin >> a >> b;

 if (a < b) {
 cout << a << " is less than " << b << endl;
 } else if (a == b) {
 cout << a << " equals " << b << endl;
 } else {
 cout << a << " is greater than " << b << endl;
 }

 return 0;
}
```
The code uses the `cout` and `cin` functions from the `iostream` library to print and read input, respectively. The `print` function used in the original code is not defined and will result in a compile error. By replacing it with `cout`, the code will work correctly and prompt the user to enter two integers, compare them, and display the appropriate message based on their relationship.
