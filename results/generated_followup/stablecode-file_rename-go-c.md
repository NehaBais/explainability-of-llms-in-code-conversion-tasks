Error explanation:
The error occurred due to extraneous ')' before ';' in multiple lines of code.
Fix explanation:
To fix this error, we need to ensure that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis at the same nesting level. In this case, it seems that there is a missing closing parenthesis in line 21 and line 23. To fix this issue, we can add a closing parenthesis ')' before each missing semi-colon ';'.
Corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char full_current_path[500] = "";
    char full_current_path_here[500] = "docs";
    char file_name[50];
    char new_file_name[50];
    char docs_directory[50] = "docs";
    char mydocs_directory[50] = "mydocs";
    size_t pos;
    char command[255];

    // Code for moving file from one directory to another.
    sprintf(command, "mv %s/%s %s/output.txt", full_current_path_here, file_name));
    system(command);

    pos = strpos(full_current_path_here, '/'));
    if (pos != string::npos) {
        sprintf(command, "mv docs mydocs"));
        system(command);
    }

    getcwd(current_working_directory, sizeof(current_working_directory)));
    printf("Current working directory: %s\n", current_working_directory));

    return 0;
}
```
