This error occurred because the types of `strchr()`, `strpbrk()`, `strncmp()`, and other C++ string functions are not equivalent to their Java counterparts. For example:

- The C++ function `strchr()` requires a pointer as an argument which returns a pointer to the located character or NULL if it was not found.
- However, in the Java version of `strncmp()`, only two strings and a length are required as arguments and this will compare the two strings up until that length with each other. If they are the same, 0 is returned otherwise a non-zero value.

To fix these errors, you need to make sure both versions behave in the similar way when it comes to string operations. Here's the corrected version of your code:

```cpp
#include <cstring> // For using strchr and strncmp
char *strchr(const char *s, int c);
int strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);
char* my_strchr(const char *s, int c) { return strchr(s,c); } // Wrapping the real C++ function with a Java-like version
void main() {
    // Using the Java-like version for string comparison
    if (strncmp("abc", my_strchr("abcde", 'd'), 1) == 0) { /* Do something */ } else { /* Handle error */ }
}
```
