This error arises because the C++ standard library doesn't provide `std::filesystem` header file which has functions to perform directory related operations, similar to JavaScript for filesystem operations. 

You may need to use system() function or equivalent function in Windows for checking file existence, for example 'dir' command or 'ls' command in Unix-like systems. This will be very inefficient compared to the standard library solution.

Here's the corrected C++ code:
```cpp
#include <direct.h>  //For directory operations
#include <stdio.h>   //For file existence check functions

int main() {
    _chdir("C:\\"); //Change to current directory (or / for Unix-like systems), but this won't work outside of Windows cmd/powershell terminal
    if (!_fso.FileExists("input.txt")) {  //For file existence check 
        printf("File does not exist\n");
    } else {
        printf("File exists\n");
    }
    if (!_fso.FolderExists("docs")) { //For folder existence check 
        printf("Folder does not exist\n");
    } else {
        printf("Folder exists\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This code checks if the files "input.txt" and "docs" exist in C:/ directory. If these files do not exist, it will print "File does not exist" or "Folder does not exist" respectively. It also changes current working directory to "C:\" using _chdir function. You can replace "C:\\" with your desired directory path.
Please note that this code is designed for Windows. For Unix-like systems, you'd need to find equivalent functions in your system.
