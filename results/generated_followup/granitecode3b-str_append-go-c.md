Error: The compiler is unable to find the `strcat` and `printf` functions, which are required by the code. To fix this, we need to include the appropriate header files that declare these functions.
Fix: Add the following lines at the beginning of the C code: `#include string.h #include stdio.h`.
Rewritten Code:
```c
#include
#include
int main() {
  char s[] = "foo";
  strcat(s, "bar");
  printf("%s", s);
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error occurred because the compiler was unable to find the `strcat` and `printf` functions in the standard library. To fix this, we included the appropriate header files that declare these functions. This allows the code to compile without errors.
