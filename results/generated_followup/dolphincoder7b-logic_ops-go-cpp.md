The error occurs because there is no main function in the C++ code for Golang. To fix this, simply add an empty main() function as shown below:
```cpp
#include  <iostream>

int main() {
    return 0;
}

void printLogic(bool a, bool b) {
  std::cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << "\n";
  std::cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << "\n";
  std::cout << "not a is " << (!a) << "\n";
}
```
The main function is required for C++ to run your program and the printLogic() function is where the logic of the code should be located. 

Note: In this case, since the original Golang code doesn't include any main function or any other setup needed to call your function printLogic(), it might be a bit difficult to verify the correctness of this conversion.
