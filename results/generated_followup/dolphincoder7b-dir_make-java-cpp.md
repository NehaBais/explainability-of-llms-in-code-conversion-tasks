The error occurs because `std::filesystem` is not included as part of the standard library in C++. To correct this, we need to include the necessary header file before using it. Here's how you can fix the code:

```cpp
#include  // Include the necessary filesystem library
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
int main() {
  try  {
    if  (fs::create_directories("C:/parent/test"))
      std::cout << "path successfully created";
   } catch  (const std::exception  &e)  {
    std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << '\n';
   }
}
```

Now, the code should compile without any errors or warnings using a C++ compiler that supports C++17 features. The program attempts to create a directory named "C:/parent/test". If successful, it prints "path successfully created" using `std::cout`. In case of any exception, it is caught in the `catch` block, and an error message is printed using `std::cerr`.
