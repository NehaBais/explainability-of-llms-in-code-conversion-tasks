Error: The C compiler is unable to find the `strcat` function, which is used to concatenate strings in C. This error occurs because the `strcat` function is not declared or defined in the current scope.

Fix: To fix this issue, you need to include the `<string.h>` header file at the beginning of your code. The `<string.h>` header file contains declarations for various string-related functions in C, including `strcat`. By including this header file, the compiler will have access to the `strcat` function and will be able to resolve the error.

Corrected code:
```c
#include <string.h> // Include the string.h header file

int main() {
    char *s1 = "Hello"; // Create a string variable equal to any text value.
    s1 = strcat(s1, ", World!"); // Append the string variable with another string
                             // literal in the most idiomatic way.
    printf("%s\n", s1); // Show the contents of the variable after the append operation.
}
```
