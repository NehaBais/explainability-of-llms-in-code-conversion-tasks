Error: "expected "FILENAME" or <FILENAME>" - This error indicates that the `rename` function expects either a filename or a file name string as its first argument, but it received two arguments instead.
Fix: Replace `"input.txt"` and `"docs"` with `L"input.txt"` and `L"docs"`, respectively, to use Unicode strings on Windows systems.
Corrected code:
```cpp
#include
int main() {
  std::rename(L"input.txt", L"output.txt");
  std::rename(L"docs", L"mydocs");
#ifdef _WIN32
  std::rename(L"C:/input.txt", L"C:/output.txt");
  std::rename(L"C:/docs", L"C:/mydocs");
#endif
  return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The error message indicates that the `rename` function expects a filename as its first argument, but it was receiving two arguments instead. To fix this, I replaced `"input.txt"` and `"docs"` with Unicode strings using the `L` prefix to indicate wide characters on Windows systems. This ensures that the code works correctly on both Windows and non-Windows systems.
