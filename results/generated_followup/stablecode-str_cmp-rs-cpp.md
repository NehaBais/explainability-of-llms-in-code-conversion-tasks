# Error explanation:
# /tmp/stablecode-str_cmp-rs-cpp.cpp:48:54: error: redefinition of 'a' with a different type: 'bool' vs 'basic_string<char, char_traits<char>, allocator<char> >' (aka 'std::__1::string')
# This error occurs because the variable 'a' is defined as an integer in line 6, and then it is redefined as a string in line 48. 

# Fix:
# To fix this error, you should give a different name to the second definition of 'a'. 
```python
# Corrected code block

std::string b = "Bac";
bool result1;

result1 = std::equal(a.begin(), a.end()), b.begin(), b.end());

bool result2;

result2 = std::equal(b.begin(), b.end()), a.rbegin(), a.rend());
```
