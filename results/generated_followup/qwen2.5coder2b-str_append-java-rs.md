The error message indicates that the crate name cannot start with a period (`.`). To fix this, change the first character of the crate name from '.' to 'q'.

```rs
fn main() {
    let mut string: String = String::from("abc");
    println!("{:?}", string);
    string.push_str("def");
    println!("{:?}", string);
}
```
This should work without any errors.
