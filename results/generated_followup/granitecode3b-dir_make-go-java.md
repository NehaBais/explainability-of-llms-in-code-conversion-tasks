Error: Expected class, interface, enum, or record, but found package name instead.
Fix: Remove "package None;" from top of file.
Corrected code:
```java
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.nio.file.attribute.PosixFilePermissions;
public class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  Files.createDirectories(Paths.get("/tmp/some/path/to/dir"));
 }
}
```
Explanation: The error message indicates that the compiler is expecting a class, interface, enum, or record, but it found a package name instead. To fix this, you need to remove the "package None;" statement from the top of the file. This will allow the Java code to be compiled successfully.
