The error occurs because the C++ standard library needs to be linked during compilation, which is not done by default in some environments.

To fix this error, we need to link against the C++ standard library when compiling the program.

Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void print_logic(bool a, bool b) {
  std::cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "not a is " << (!a) << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  bool a = true, b = false;

  print_logic(a, b);

  return 0;
}
``` 

This code defines a `main()` function that creates two boolean variables (`a` and `b`) with initial values of `true` and `false`, respectively. It then calls the `print_logic()` function with these values, and finally returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

When compiling this code, you should include `-lstdc++` in the compilation command to link against the C++ standard library. For example:

clang++ -o program program.cpp -lstdc++
