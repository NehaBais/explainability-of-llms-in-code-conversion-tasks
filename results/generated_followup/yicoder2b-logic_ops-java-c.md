The error `Undefined symbols for architecture arm64` usually occurs if you are trying to compile or link with an undefined symbol, typically those from a library that's not installed on your system. The symbol `"_main"` is a special symbol defined in the C standard libraries. It is not being used anywhere in your code and hence it causes this error.

The solution would be to define this symbol if you are compiling for iOS (`-framework CoreFoundation`) or Android (`-landroid`), which are known to link `_main` symbol when using the respective SDKs:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void logic(int a, int b) {
  // AND operator 1 if both operands are true, else 0
  int and = (a && b);

  // OR operator 1 if any of the operands is true, else 0
  int or = (a || b);

  // NOT operator 1 if operand is false, else 0
  int not_a = (!a);

  printf("a AND b: %d\n", and);
  printf("a OR b: %d\n", or);
  printf("NOT a: %d\n", not_a);
}
```
This code should compile without errors now.

Note that the C programming language does not support logical operators like `&&` and `||` in the way you are using them in Java. The equivalent bitwise operations are being used here for logical AND (`&`) and logical OR (`|`). This is valid under certain conditions but is not typical for most situations, so it's worth noting this difference if you are learning about bitwise operators in C.
