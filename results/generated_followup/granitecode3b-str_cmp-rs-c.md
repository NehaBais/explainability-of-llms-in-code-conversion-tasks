Error: The Rust code uses the `strcmp` function, which is a standard library function in C that compares two strings for equality and returns 0 if they are equal, -1 if the first string is lexically before the second, and 1 if the first string is lexically after the second. In the C code, the `strcmp` function is used without declaring it as a library function, which results in an error.
Fix: The Rust code uses the `cmp` method of the `String` struct to compare two strings for equality. This method returns an integer value that indicates the relationship between the two strings. In the C code, the `strcmp` function is replaced with the `strcmp` method of the `String` struct.
Corrected code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    const char* a = "hello";
    const char* b = "world";
    
    int result = strcmp(a, b);
    if (result == 0) {
        printf("The strings are equal\n");
    } else if (result < 0) {
        printf("%s is lexically before %s\n", a, b);
    } else {
        printf("%s is lexically after %s\n", a, b);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
