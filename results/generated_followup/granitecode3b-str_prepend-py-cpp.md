Error: The `#include` directive is not valid in C++. It must be used to include header files, but it cannot be used to include standard libraries like `<string>`.
Fix: Replace the `include` directive with the appropriate C++ header file and remove any unnecessary whitespace.
Rewritten code:
```cpp
#include
 using namespace std;
 
int main() {
  string s = "12345678";
  string new_s = "0" + s; // by concatenation
  cout << new_s << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
