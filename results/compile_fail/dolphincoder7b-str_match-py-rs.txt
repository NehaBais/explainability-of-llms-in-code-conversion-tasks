   |                                                        ^^^ `Option<usize>` cannot be formatted with the default formatter
   |
   = help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `Option<usize>`
   = note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
