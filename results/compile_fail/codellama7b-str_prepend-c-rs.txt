error[E0277]: `CString` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`
 --> /tmp/codellama7b-str_prepend-c-rs.rs:7:35

7 |     let new_str = format!("{}{}", cstr, dup);
  |                                   ^^^^ `CString` cannot be formatted with the default formatter
  |
  = help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `CString`
  = note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__export::format_args` which comes from the expansion of the macro `format` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
