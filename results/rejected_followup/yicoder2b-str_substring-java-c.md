Your question is quite long, but I will try to help nonetheless by giving a C equivalent for some of the functions provided in Java. Keep in mind that the exact results may vary depending on the input given, as these are translated approximations.

Remember that these codes will create different outputs as they are translated approximations to the original Java functions. In Java, you can get substrings using the `substring()` method and for getting consecutive substrings you need to provide the length twice the required string length.
