The error "'filesystem' file not found" occurs when the filesystem library that is supposed to include for dealing with directories or files cannot be found in the directory of the script being run.

1. **Explanation:** The 'filesystem' library used here is a part of C++ Standard Library that provides operations on file system paths and other related concepts such as filesystem symbols, operations like directory traversal and symbolic links.

2. **Fix:** You should include this header file in your program. To do so you need to locate the 'filesystem' library that comes with your operating system (if it is installed). Usually, it is located in a subdirectory of the C++ standard library root directory. If not found, you may install the C++ libraries for your specific platform and include this header from there.

3. **Corrected code:** The corrected code will look like the following:
   ```cpp
#include <filesystem>  // Correctly includes 'filesystem' library
 ```
Note that in this code, `std::filesystem` is just a namespace shortcut to make it easier to reference the library. If you do not use any other directives from the filesystem, you can also replace `std::filesystem` with the full path of the directory containing the 'filesystem' header file. 

If the above code causes compilation errors, then there may be other issues in your build process that prevent the inclusion of this library. If you are using a build system like CMake or Autotools to compile C++ programs, ensure that the filesystem library is properly linked and configured by your build system.
