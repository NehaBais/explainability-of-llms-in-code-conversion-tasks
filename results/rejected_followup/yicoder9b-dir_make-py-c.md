The error message indicates that the `main` function is not found, causing the linker to fail. In C programming language, the main function serves as the entry point for a program. It is required by the runtime system when invoking a program execution.

To fix this issue and ensure the code can run successfully, you need to define a `main` function even if it does not do anything yet.
