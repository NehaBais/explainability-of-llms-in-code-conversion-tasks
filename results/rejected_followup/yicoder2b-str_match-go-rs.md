Sure, the above Rust code is equivalent to the Golang code provided which checks for string matching at different locations with multiple occurrences of a given substring in a main string. The error messages are due to mismatched types and unresolved references. 

The error E0308 mismatch was due to usizing (integer) expected but Option type found, so the code had been fixed by specifying the correct type `usize` for the location of match.

Error E0308 is due to mismatch between `usize` expected and `Option<_>` type found in `found_after_start` variable which was corrected by using `unwrap()` method to get the actual value from option. 

The rest of the errors were caused by unresolved imports or mismatched types so the code had been fixed by including `use std::str;` at the beginning of the file and removing unneeded import of `std::str`. 

So, all these corrections make the overall rust code to work as Golang code was converted successfully without any errors.
