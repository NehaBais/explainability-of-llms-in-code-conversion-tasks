This problem seems to be related to bitwise operations in Java, specifically operations on integers that are not unsigned (thus they can't represent negative numbers). The '~' operator is used for the NOT operation which is undefined for signed integers. Additionally, bit shifting is also undefined when trying to shift a signed number left or right by more than its total bits. 

However, I would suggest that you clarify what operations are required and let us know how you want these operations to be carried out in Java. If you provide further details on your use case, we can help address the issues related to bitwise operations in Java.
