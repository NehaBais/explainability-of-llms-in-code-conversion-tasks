It seems like there is an issue with your code. The problem might lie somewhere in your code, not necessarily a syntax error but something logical may be happening. Here's a general idea of what the possible issues could be:

1. Syntax Error - The most common issue related to errors you are experiencing will be syntax errors. These usually occur when there is a logical issue with how the code is written or if the correct syntax for something doesn't match your intention.

2. Typing Errors - If it seems like your typing has been messed up, check if you have used the right characters and not just symbols. Make sure you are using the correct keywords and functions as per the Rust programming language.

3. Compilation Errors - If you get a 'Compilation Errors' then the issue might be due to something in your code that does not compile, like missing semicolons or improper closing of brackets.

4. Logic errors - A logic error is when something seems logically correct but it could be wrong in some way, especially if there are inherent rules to your code which you are ignoring. You might have forgotten a condition check or a for loop will not run if certain conditions are not met.

5. Out of Range Error - If you get an out of range error then the issue might be with the indexes you're using in your array or something else that's trying to access data outside your declared limit.

6. Code Not Executing as Expected - If you are trying to perform a task and it seems like the code is not executing as expected, check if there are logic errors or wrong condition checks.

You might want to re-write the problematic sections of the code, check for typos or special characters, ensure that your code follows the correct syntax, and test your code again. 

The specific issue might vary based on the exact error message you get when running your code. If you can provide a small piece of code that specifically shows the problem with your existing code, we'd be able to assist better.
