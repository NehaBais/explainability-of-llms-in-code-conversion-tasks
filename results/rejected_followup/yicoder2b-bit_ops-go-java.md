Your request appears to be incomplete or incorrect, so I cannot help with a specific error message from your Golang/Java code. However, here's a general advice:

1. The operations performed on the first integer with a shift/rotate amount of the second integer can be handled differently in Java and Python (for example, left shift is performed using '<<=') compared to Go (where bitwise operators like << are used). If you want to perform similar operations in both languages, please specify which language you'd like help with.
2. The error message you provided is a bit technical and it might not be directly understandable by a human. Please provide the specific error you encountered while using your Go/Java code.
