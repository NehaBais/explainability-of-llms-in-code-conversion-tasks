This problem requires a detailed explanation of Rust's string comparison syntax, error handling, and case sensitivity handling. We can't directly run this in the environment as we don't have access to it, but here is an explanation:

1. In Rust, you cannot compare a `String` with an `&str` or vice versa. This is because these types are only comparable when they refer to the same location in memory. They represent different views into the string, and therefore don't share the same lifetime. The closest we can get is to coerce them to `&str` if needed (e.g., for comparison) but this would involve creating a copy of the String, so it's not quite as efficient or idiomatic as it could be in Rust.

2. The `eq_ignore_ascii_case()` method from AsciiExt is used for case insensitive equality. It will ignore ASCII letters with different casing during the comparison.

3. The `to_ascii_uppercase()` method from AsciiExt converts all ASCII uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing. This is generally not needed unless you specifically want to treat all uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent (e.g., for case insensitive comparison).

4. If you need to compare two `String` instances in a way that makes no distinction between their casing, the easiest is probably just to coerce them into `&str` slices and then compare those directly.

5. If the goal is to have a case sensitive comparison, you should use `String` directly.

6. The `eq_ignore_ascii_case` and other methods from `AsciiExt` are only available if you're willing to accept some performance overhead for case sensitivity.

Note: It's important to be aware that string comparison in Rust can be a little tricky due to the way it handles different types of strings. The provided code might not compile or behave as expected without understanding how `String` and `&str` interaction work in Rust. It's also important to understand how case-sensitive comparisons are handled, which is a major reason why `eq_ignore_ascii_case()` exists.
