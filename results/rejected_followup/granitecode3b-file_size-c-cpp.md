Error: 
- The first error is caused by not properly including the `<iostream>` header file, which declares the `cout` object. To fix this, add `#include` before any other headers in the C++ code.
- The second error occurs because the `stat()` function returns an integer, and the `if` statement checks if it is equal to 0. If it is not, then an error occurred, so it prints an error message instead of the file size. To fix this, remove the `if` statement entirely, or change it to something else that evaluates to either true or false.
- The third warning occurs because the code uses the implicitly-defined namespace `std`. To fix this, use a different name for the namespace, or include the `<iostream>` header file before any other headers in the C++ code.
- The remaining errors are caused by incorrect variable declarations and usage of functions and objects from the `<sys/stat.h>` header file. To fix these errors, declare the `struct stat` variable as a local variable within the function, or use another name for the `info` variable. Also, be sure to include the appropriate header file for the `stat()` function.
