Error: The `mkdir` function is not declared or defined in this code snippet, as it is not a part of the C++ standard library.
Fix: Add the necessary include statements to make the `mkdir` function available. For example, adding `#include <cstdlib>` and `#include <sys/stat.h>` should allow the code to compile and run successfully.
