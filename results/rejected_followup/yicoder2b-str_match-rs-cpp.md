There are a number of errors in the error log. The text is somewhat scrambled, but it seems to have been cut off somewhere around the "start" of code. Here's what I can infer:

1. The problem is not related to a coding issue. It pertains to explaining programming related issues.
2. The errors are related to comparisons involving types. These errors are typically caused when two types do not match in terms of functionality or compatibility. 
3. Example: `errors generated` - this seems to be saying that there were some errors while compiling the code. The exact type of error is not mentioned.
4. The issue might be with the usage of specific data types, and the compiler may not understand them correctly.
5. The specific issues vary depending on how the errors are categorized or listed in your programming environment or IDE. 
6. If possible, you should provide the precise problem/error message to assist with corrective action. Without knowing what the exact issue is, it's tough to give a specific solution.
7. If possible, provide an example code snippet that contains the error messages so that I can diagnose and fix your issue accurately.
8. The text seems to be cut off due to the "im_end" part of the code. You should continue writing the rest of the code.
