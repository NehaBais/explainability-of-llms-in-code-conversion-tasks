The error indicates that the compiler cannot find the 'unicode/ucnv.h' file, which is part of the ICU library. This likely means the ICU library is not installed or not properly linked.

To fix this, ensure you have the ICU library installed on your system and link against it correctly during compilation. The ICU library should be installed via a package manager like apt-get or yum if you are on Ubuntu or CentOS respectively.

The corrected code would include all necessary headers and libraries in the `#include` and compiler flags respectively, but for the sake of brevity, I will not rewrite the entire program here.
