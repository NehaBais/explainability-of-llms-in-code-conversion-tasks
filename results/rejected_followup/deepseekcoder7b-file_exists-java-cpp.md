The error occurs because `std::filesystem` is not declared or available by default, it needs to be specifically enabled during compilation which is often not done for security reasons. 

To fix this issue, you need to compile the C++ program with `-std=c++17` and also link against `stdc++fs` (which provides support for `<filesystem>`). The command might look like: `g++ -std=c++17 -lc++fs my_program.cpp`

Corrected code:

```cpp
#include <experimental/filesystem>
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
int main() {
  if (fs::exists("docs/input.txt") && fs::is_regular_file("docs/input.txt")){
    std::cout << "File exists\n";
  } else {
    std::cout << "The file does not exist.\n";
  }
  
  if (fs::exists("/docs") && fs::is_directory("/docs")){
    std::cout << "/docs exists\n";
  } else {
    std::cout << "The /docs directory does not exist.\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
