Error: `/tmp/stablecode-file_create-go-cpp.cpp:`28:38` error: expected expression.
Fix: Add a missing parenthesis in the catch statement. The correct syntax for catching exceptions is `catch(const std::exception& e) {...}`. In your code, you have an extra closing parenthesis after the condition (`if (...)`) in the catch block. To fix this error, you need to remove the extra closing parenthesis from the catch block.
