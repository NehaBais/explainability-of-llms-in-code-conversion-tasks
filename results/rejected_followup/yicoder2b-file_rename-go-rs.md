This error means that there is an issue with your code. There are more than one possible reasons for this error - 14 different reasons listed out.

Error E0308: mismatched types: This happens when the types of the variables do not match in a method or operator, like '&&' or '+'. It is often caused by a wrong use of parenthesis and brackets.

- Error E0599: no function or associated item named `new` found for struct `File` - This happens when you are trying to build a new instance of the File struct but there is no `new` function defined in that struct. It could be because you are using deprecated functions to create instances of this struct.
  
- Error E0308: mismatched types: In this case, it means that one variable is expecting an integer type and a character type were provided. There should not have been any non-numeric characters present in your file path or directory paths, which are being passed to the `as_str()` method.
  
The fix will be dependent on what function you tried to use for creating instances of `File` and whether it is still viable after removing deprecated functions. You might need to adjust your code to use the correct methods or operators. 

If you are not sure about which function you should use, check the documentation on `new()` method in the File struct. For example: https://docs.rs/fs/1.0.0/fs#method[open](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.File.html#method.open)
 
Also, the error message indicates that you may have had multiple errors, so you might want to try to understand each of them individually and correct them one by one. If none of these work then it would be helpful if you could provide your code with all possible errors for me to help you better.
