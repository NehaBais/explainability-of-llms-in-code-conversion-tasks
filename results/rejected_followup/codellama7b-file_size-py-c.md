Error: The compiler is unable to find the declaration of the `strerror` function, which is used to retrieve an error message from the operating system. This is an issue with the C standard library not being properly included in the code.

Fix: Include the `<string.h>` header file, which contains the declaration of the `strerror` function. This can be done by adding the following line at the beginning of the code: `#include <string.h>`.
