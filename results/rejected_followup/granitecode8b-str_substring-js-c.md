The error message indicates that there are multiple undeclared functions, headers, or variables, as well as conflicting types for two functions with the same name. The fix involves ensuring that all necessary headers and functions are included, as well as checking for any conflicting types. The corrected code should include all the necessary function definitions and declarations, as well as the appropriate header inclusions.
