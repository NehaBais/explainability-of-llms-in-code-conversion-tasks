This problem involves understanding of bitwise operations in both Rust and C programming languages. 

The first error encountered is due to the `fn main()` function, which is not valid in Rust or C language. The correct way to write a program's entry point is to use the function named `main()` without any parameters.

In Rust, the println! macro prints output to the terminal and returns the number of characters written (0 for no output).
The error `unknown type name 'fn'` is due to Rust not being able to recognize the type of variable `a` or `b` in your code snippet. This has been corrected by changing them to their actual types. 

In C, the format specifier for printing unsigned integers is `%u` which matches Rust's syntax.
```
The printf function in C does not return the number of characters written but it can be used to check whether output was successfully printed. If there were any formatting errors this would return zero. 

The error `use of undeclared identifier 'let'` is because in Rust, we use `let` for variable declaration and `var` or `let mut` for mutable variable declaration. These have been replaced with the actual variables used in your code snippet. 

Please note that the syntax for printing binary representation of a number differs between C and Rust. In C, you can print the binary representation using the format specifier `%b`, while in Rust, there's no direct equivalent but you can achieve it by `{:08b}` which pads with zero on the left to reach 8 bits (equivalent to `{:b}`).

Please replace your code snippet with the corrected C version and run it again to see if there are any errors now or not.
