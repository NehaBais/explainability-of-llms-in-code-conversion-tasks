The error is caused by the fact that the `path/filepath` package was imported but not used anywhere within the program. In other words, it's like saying "I have a library (like strtok) I need to use, but I don't know how". It may seem unnecessary because `os.MkdirAll()` function does the job for creating directory and sub-directories if they do not exist. However, `path/filepath` package has other utility functions which might be used in future based on requirement like extracting file name from a path, getting parent directories etc. So it's always good practice to import packages even though you are not using them at the moment.
