The errors in Rust are related to type mismatches and the lack of implementation for certain traits (BitAnd, BitOr, etc.). To resolve these issues:

1. Use the `bitand` method instead of `&`.
2. Cast to `u32`, perform operation, then cast back to `i16`.
3. Instead of using a bitwise not operator (`^`), use the `!` and `<<` operators together as shown in the example code.
4. The `<<` and `>>` operations on signed integers automatically do arithmetic shifts, so we need to cast to unsigned first.
5. The `&` operator is not applicable for signed numbers due to Rust's two's complement representation of negative numbers. The `BitAnd` trait should be implemented for i16.
