To fix these errors, you need to update the dependencies and the Rust version. The error messages indicate that there is an issue with the `std` crate, which provides the standard library functions. You can update the `Cargo.toml` file to use a different version of `std`. After updating, run `cargo build` again to see if the errors are resolved.
