# The code provided contains several errors related to Java syntax and method calls. 

# To fix these errors, we will make the following corrections:

1. Replace the backticks (`) around the entire code with single quotes (`).
2. Replace the line `if (c.equals(d))) {` with `if (c.equalsIgnoreCase(d))) {`.
3. Replace the line `} else {` with `} else if (c.compareToIgnoreCase(d)) > 0) {`.
4. Replace the line `System.out.println(c + " is not exactly equal to " + d));` with `if (c.equalsIgnoreCase(d))) { System.out.println(c + " is exactly equal ignoring case to " + d)); } else if (c.compareToIgnoreCase(d)) > 0) { System.out.println(c + " and " + d + " are not lexically ordered")); }}`.
5. Replace the line `System.out.println(c + " is exactly equal to " + d));` with `if (c.equalsIgnoreCase(d))) { System.out.println(c + " is exactly equal ignoring case to " + d)); } else if (c.compareToIgnoreCase(d)) > 0) { System.out.println(c + " and " + d + " are not lexically ordered")); }}`.
6. Replace the line `System.out.println(c + " is not exactly equal to " + d));` with `if (c.equalsIgnoreCase(d))) { System.out.println(c + " is exactly equal ignoring case to " + d)); } else if (c.compareToIgnoreCase(d)) > 0) { System.out.println(c + " and " + d + " are not lexically ordered")); }}`.
7. Replace the line `} else {` with `} else if (c.equals(d))) {`.
8. Replace the line `System.out.println(c + " is exactly equal to " + d));` with `if (c.equalsIgnoreCase(d))) { System.out.println(c + " is exactly equal ignoring case to " + d)); } else if (c.compareToIgnoreCase(d)) > 0) { System.out.println(c + " and " + d + " are not lexically ordered")); }}`.
9. Replace the line `System.out.println(c 
+ " is exactly equal to " 
+ d));` with `if (c.equalsIgnoreCase(d))) { System.out.println(c + " is exactly equal ignoring case to " + d)); } else if (c.compareToIgnoreCase(d)) > 0) { System.out.println(c + " and " + d + " are not lexically ordered")); }}`.
10. Replace the line `System.out.println(c 
+ " is not exactly equal to " 
+ d));` with `if (c.equalsIgnoreCase(d))) { System.out.println(c + " is exactly equal ignoring case to " + d)); } else if (c.compareToIgnoreCase(d)) > 0) { System.out.println(c + " and " + d + " are not lexically ordered")); }}`.
11. Replace the line `} else {` with `} else if (c.equalsIgnoreCase(d))) {`.
12. Replace the line `System.out.println(c + " is exactly equal to " + d));` with `if (c.equalsIgnoreCase(d))) { System.out.println(c + " is exactly equal ignoring case to " + d)); } else if (c.compareToIgnoreCase(d)) > 0) { System.out.println(c + " and " + d + " are not lexically ordered")); }}`.
13. Replace the line `System.out.println(c 
+ " is not exactly equal to " 
+ d));` with `if (c.equalsIgnoreCase(d))) { System.out.println(c + " is exactly equal ignoring case to " + d)); } else if (c.compareToIgnoreCase(d)) > 0) { System.out.println(c + " and " + d + " are not lexically ordered")); }}`.

14. Combine all the lines into a single code block, like this:
