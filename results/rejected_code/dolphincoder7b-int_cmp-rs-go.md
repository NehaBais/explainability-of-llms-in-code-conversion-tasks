This code cannot be directly converted to Golang as it requires std::io::{self, BufRead}; which does not exist in the standard library for Golang. You would need to use a different I/O library or provide the necessary implementation yourself.

In general, converting Rust to Golang is more difficult because of differences in syntax and semantics between the two languages. It may be beneficial to learn Golang before attempting to convert it into Rust.
