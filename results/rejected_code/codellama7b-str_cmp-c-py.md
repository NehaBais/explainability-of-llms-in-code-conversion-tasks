 This is a C program that demonstrates various string comparison operations using the `strcmp()` and `strcasecmp()` functions. The code includes macros for comparing two strings for exact equality, inequality, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to, both with and without case sensitivity.

Here's a breakdown of each line:

1. `#include<string.h>` - Includes the string header file, which contains the `strcmp()` and `strcasecmp()` functions used in this program.
2. `#define STREQ(A,B) (0==strcmp((A),(B)))` - Defines a macro called `STREQ` that checks whether two strings are equal using the `strcmp()` function. It returns 1 if the strings are equal and 0 otherwise.
3. `#define STRNE(A,B) (!STREQ(A,B))` - Defines a macro called `STRNE` that checks whether two strings are not equal using the `strcmp()` function. It returns 1 if the strings are not equal and 0 if they are equal.
4. `#define STRLT(A,B) (strcmp((A),(B))<0)` - Defines a macro called `STRLT` that checks whether one string is lexically ordered before another using the `strcmp()` function. It returns 1 if the first string is lexically ordered before the second and 0 otherwise.
5. `#define STRLE(A,B) (strcmp((A),(B))<=0)` - Defines a macro called `STRLE` that checks whether one string is lexically ordered before or equal to another using the `strcmp()` function. It returns 1 if the first string is lexically ordered before or equal to the second and 0 otherwise.
6. `#define STRGT(A,B) STRLT(B,A)` - Defines a macro called `STRGT` that checks whether one string is lexically ordered after another using the `strcmp()` function. It returns 1 if the first string is lexically ordered after the second and 0 otherwise.
7. `#define STRGE(A,B) STRLE(B,A)` - Defines a macro called `STRGE` that checks whether one string is lexically ordered after or equal to another using the `strcmp()` function. It returns 1 if the first string is lexically ordered after or equal to the second and 0 otherwise.
8. `#define STRCEQ(A,B) (0==strcasecmp((A),(B)))` - Defines a macro called `STRCEQ` that checks whether two strings are equal using the `strcasecmp()` function, which ignores case differences when comparing strings. It returns 1 if the strings are equal and 0 otherwise.
9. `#define STRCNE(A,B) (!STRCEQ(A,B))` - Defines a macro called `STRCNE` that checks whether two strings are not equal using the `strcasecmp()` function, which ignores case differences when comparing strings. It returns 1 if the strings are not equal and 0 if they are equal.
10. `#define STRCLT(A,B) (strcasecmp((A),(B))<0)` - Defines a macro called `STRCLT` that checks whether one string is lexically ordered before another using the `strcasecmp()` function, which ignores case differences when comparing strings. It returns 1 if the first string is lexically ordered before the second and 0 otherwise.
11. `#define STRCLE(A,B) (strcasecmp((A),(B))<=0)` - Defines a macro called `STRCLE` that checks whether one string is lexically ordered before or equal to another using the `strcasecmp()` function, which ignores case differences when comparing strings. It returns 1 if the first string is lexically ordered before or equal to the second and 0 otherwise.
12. `#define STRCGT(A,B) STRCLT(B,A)` - Defines a macro called `STRCGT` that checks whether one string is lexically ordered after another using the `strcasecmp()` function, which ignores case differences when comparing strings. It returns 1 if the first string is lexically ordered after the second and 0 otherwise.
13. `#define STRCGE(A,B) STRCLE(B,A)` - Defines a macro called `STRCGE` that checks whether one string is lexically ordered after or equal to another using the `strcasecmp()` function, which ignores case differences when comparing strings. It returns 1 if the first string is lexically ordered after or equal to the second and 0 otherwise.
14. `#include<stdio.h>` - Includes the standard input/output header file, which contains functions for reading and writing to the console.
15. `int main() {` - The `main()` function is the entry point of the program, where execution begins. It returns an integer value as its exit status.
16. `char *a, *b;` - Declares two pointers to char variables, called `a` and `b`, which will be used to store the strings that will be compared.
17. `scanf("%s", &a);` - Reads a string from the console using the `scanf()` function and stores it in the variable `a`. The `%s` format specifier tells `scanf()` to read a string.
18. `printf("Enter second string: ");` - Displays a prompt on the console asking the user to enter the second string.
19. `scanf("%s", &b);` - Reads a string from the console using the `scanf()` function and stores it in the variable `b`. The `%s` format specifier tells `scanf()` to read a string.
20. `printf("a = %s\nb = %s\n", a, b);` - Displays the values of the variables `a` and `b` on the console using the `printf()` function. The `%s` format specifier tells `printf()` to display a string.
21. `if (STREQ(a, b)) {` - Checks whether the strings stored in `a` and `b` are equal using the `STREQ` macro. If they are equal, the code inside the if statement is executed.
22. `printf("Strings are equal\n");` - Displays a message on the console saying that the strings are equal.
23. `} else {` - If the strings are not equal, the code inside this block is executed.
24. `if (STRLT(a, b)) {` - Checks whether the string stored in `a` is lexically ordered before the string stored in `b`. If it is, the code inside this block is executed.
25. `printf("String a is lexically ordered before string b\n");` - Displays a message on the console saying that the string stored in `a` is lexically ordered before the string stored in `b`.
26. `} else {` - If the string stored in `a` is not lexically ordered before the string stored in `b`, this block is executed.
27. `if (STRLT(b, a)) {` - Checks whether the string stored in `b` is lexically ordered before the string stored in `a`. If it is, the code inside this block is executed.
28. `printf("String b is lexically ordered before string a\n");` - Displays a message on the console saying that the string stored in `b` is lexically ordered before the string stored in `a`.
29. `} else {` - If neither of the strings are lexically ordered before or after the other, this block is executed.
30. `printf("Strings are not equal and have no lexical order\n");` - Displays a message on the console saying that the strings are not equal and have no lexical order.
31. `return 0;` - Returns the exit status of the program, which is 0 in this case to indicate success.

This program demonstrates how to use macros to perform string comparison operations and also shows how to use the `strcmp()` and `strcasecmp()` functions to compare strings with or without regard for case sensitivity.
