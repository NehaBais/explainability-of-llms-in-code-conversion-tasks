Answer: 
The code is written in C++ and Rust. There are two main differences between the two languages:
- In Rust, you can use `const` to make a variable immutable, while in C++, it's not possible to do so with variables that are passed into functions by value (except for primitive types).
- In Rust, there is no concept of namespaces; instead, everything lives within the global namespace. This makes the code more concise and easier to read than it would be if you had to use full names every time you wanted to refer to something from another module or file.
