This code is written in Golang and it demonstrates how to compare two strings: exact equality, inequality (inverse), lexical orderings, comparing strings of different types. 

The provided task focuses on the comparison operators that are provided by the language itself: "==" for checking equality, "!=" for checking inequality, ">" for ordering and "<" as well as ">=" and "<=" for handling lexical comparisons.

In the case of comparing string values with numeric types in Go, these strings are converted to their respective integer or float types before comparison. 

The provided code also includes a case-insensitive comparison which is done using the EqualFold method from strings package. This uses simple case folding rules to compare two strings under Unicode. The 'when interpreted as UTF-8 and compared under Unicode simple case folding rules' part of the output makes it clear about these comparison methods.

For more advanced or type sensitive comparisons, the Go sub-repository golang.org/x/text is a good option to extend this basic approach with libraries for Unicode string handling and collation.
