JavaScript doesn't have a built-in function to rename files or directories, but it can be accomplished using Node.js native `fs` module. In your case, you would use the `rename()` method of this module as follows: 

Firstly ensure that the necessary permissions for reading and writing are granted in the directory where the script is running, then proceed with renaming files/directories. If any issues occur, they will be thrown by the function, which you can catch and handle accordingly:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Rename in current directory
try {
  fs.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt', (err) => { if(err) throw err; });
} catch (error) {
  console.log("An error occurred while trying to rename the file in the current directory.");
}

try {
  fs.rename('docs', 'mydocs', (err) => { if(err) throw err; });
} catch (error) {
  console.log("An error occurred while trying to rename the directory in the current directory.");
}

// Rename at filesystem root level, assuming '/' is the root of your file system
try {
  fs.rename('/input.txt', '/output.txt', (err) => { if(err) throw err; });
} catch (error) {
  console.log("An error occurred while trying to rename the file at filesystem root level.");
}

try {
  fs.rename('/docs', '/mydocs', (err) => { if(err) throw err; });
} catch (error) {<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>﻿ 2007-10-31, USA, 69545856, 9360148, 44.35%); Dear Mr. Johnson, Please send your invoices to the address below as soon as possible in order for us to get started on our project.
