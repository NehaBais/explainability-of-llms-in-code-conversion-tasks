In C++, you can use the `<filesystem>` library that was introduced in C++17 for file operations like size reading etc., or you can continue using older methods like `<fstream>` and `ifstream`. Here I'll be demonstrating both approaches for a cross-platform code:

Approach 1 - Using the <filesystem> library:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <filesystem>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

void printFileSize(const std::string& f) {
    if (exists(f)) {
        auto file_size = file_size(f);
        std::cout << "The size of the file is: "<< file_size <<" bytes."<<std::endl;
    } else{
        std::cerr << "File does not exist.\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    printFileSize("input.txt");
    //for root directory, use / or specify the path correctly on your platform
    printFileSize("/input.txt");

This is a sample docker-compose.yml that will set up a local development environment using PHP, Apache, MySQL (with persistent data storage), and WordPress:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    expose:
      - "9000"
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
    volumes: 
      - ./wordpress:/var/www/html
  
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
      MYSQL_USER: wordpress
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
    volumes: 
      - ./db-data:/var/lib/mysql
```
This will start two services, `wordpress` and `db`. The WordPress service uses the official WordPress Docker image which includes Apache and PHP along with a MySQL client for connecting to the database, while the db service runs the official MySQL 5.7 Docker image.

To use this configuration, you must have Docker Compose installed on your machine (you can download it from [here](https://docs.docker.<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>com/compose/install/)). Then in a terminal session navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file and run:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```
This will start your WordPress server accessible at http://localhost:8080 (you may need to open this link on a browser if you're accessing it for the first time). 

Please note that in the example above we expose port `9000`, so your WordPress site is not exposed to external network but can still be accessed from other containers. If you want to make it publicly accessible (on e.g., port `80`), then remove the `:80` part of `ports` line.
