This code compares two strings and prints the result of each comparison.
The function takes two arguments: a string and another string. Then it will compare them using Python's built-in operators for comparison.

Firstly, the function will check if the first argument is less than the second argument using '<'. If this condition is true, it will print a message stating that the first string is strictly less than the second string.
The next condition checks if the first argument is less than or equal to the second argument using ' <= '. This means that the strings are either identical or the first string is lexically ordered before the second string. If this condition is true, it will print a message stating that the strings are less than or equal to each other.
The next condition checks if the first argument is greater than the second argument using ' > '. This means that the first string is lexically ordered after the second string. If this condition is true, it will print a message stating that the first string is strictly greater than the second string.
The final condition checks if the first argument is greater than or equal to the second argument using ' >= '. This means that the strings are either identical or the first string is lexically ordered after the second string. If this condition is true, it will print a message stating that the strings are greater than or equal to each other.
The function then checks if the strings are equal using ' == '. If this condition is true, it will print a message stating that the strings are equal.
Finally, it checks if the strings have negated object identity using ' != '. This means that the strings do not refer to the same object in memory and may have different values. If this condition is true, it will print a message stating that the strings do not have negated object identity.
The function then calls itself recursively for each of these conditions, passing in the two arguments. It prints out the results of each comparison using the 'print' function.
To summarize, the code demonstrates how to compare two strings lexically and print the result using Python's built-in operators for comparison.
