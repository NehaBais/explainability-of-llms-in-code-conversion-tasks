The code needs to return true if both files exist or false if either don't exist. 

Also, you should not include any null checks in the conversion (i.e., there shouldnâ€™t be a "if(file !=null) {do stuff} else {exit}").   If Java would throw an exception for that condition then C++ will too and no extra effort is required to handle it correctly.
