## Exercise 3:
Convert the following code from Java to Python. This is the requirement for the code - Create a string variable equal to any text value and assign it to an index position within that same variable, then print out this new substring.

String string = "abc";
string += string.substring(1); // prints "b" because strings are 0-indexed in Java
System.out.println(string);
```
