 This code compares two strings using the `strcmp` and `strcasecmp` functions in C. It demonstrates how to compare two strings for exact equality, inequality, lexical ordering before or after another string, and how to achieve both case-sensitive and case-insensitive comparisons within the language.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The first section defines several macros that wrap the `strcmp` and `strcasecmp` functions. These macros are used throughout the program to compare strings.
2. The second section includes the `<string.h>` header file, which provides the `strcmp` and `strcasecmp` functions for comparing strings.
3. The third section defines a function called `compare`, which takes two string arguments `a` and `b`. It uses the `STREQ`, `STRNE`, `STRGT`, `STRLT`, `STRGE`, and `STRLE` macros to compare the two strings using the `strcmp` function.
4. The fourth section defines a function called `comparecase`, which is similar to the `compare` function but uses the `STRCEQ`, `STRCNE`, `STRCGT`, `STRCLT`, `STRCGE`, and `STRCLE` macros to compare the two strings using the `strcasecmp` function.
5. The fifth section defines a `main` function, which takes an array of string arguments `av`. It loops through each pair of strings in the array, comparing them using the `compare` and `comparecase` functions.
6. The last line of the program prints a message to the user indicating that the comparison is complete.

In summary, this code demonstrates how to compare two strings in C using the `strcmp` and `strcasecmp` functions, as well as how to achieve both case-sensitive and case-insensitive comparisons within the language.
