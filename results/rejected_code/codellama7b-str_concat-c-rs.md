This code converts a string to another string by concatenating the first string with another string. The first string is named 's' and its value is set to "hello". The second string is also called s2, and it is created using the sconcat function which takes two strings as parameters, concatenates them into a new string, and returns the result.
The first part of the code simply prints out the literal value of the 's' string, followed by a newline character. This could be done more concisely with just printf("%s\n", s);
In the second part, the program concatenates the 's' string with " literal" using the sconcat function and stores the result in 's2'. It then prints out the value of 's2' by calling the puts() function. Finally, it frees the memory used to store the value of 's2' by calling free().
