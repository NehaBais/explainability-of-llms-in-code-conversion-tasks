// JavaScript code for the same logic

/*
Explanation:
- The `switch` statement is used in Go for multiple conditionals and to run different blocks of code based on conditions that are met. In this case, it checks if `n1` is less than `n2`, equal to `n2`, or greater than `n2`. If the first conditional isn't true, then the second one will be evaluated (and so on).
- The other parts of the code should also work with no modifications required.
