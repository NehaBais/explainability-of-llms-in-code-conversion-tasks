This is a Python equivalent of the Rust code you provided. To achieve what you want, we will use the += operator to append strings together in most idiomatic way. Here's how it works:

1. We define a string variable named 'hello' with a value of "Hello world".
2. In the first example, we call the `add` method on hello and pass a string literal as an argument. The `add` method is defined in the std::ops module to enable the '+' operator for types that implement the Add trait. This allows us to concatenate strings using the '+' operator. However, since we're not using this feature here, we need to use the `String::from_str()` function instead of calling `add`.
3. In the second example, we create a mutable string variable and assign it a value of "Hello world". Then, we call the `push_str` method on hello and pass a string literal as an argument. This will append the given string to the end of the existing one.
4. Finally, we print out the contents of 'hello' using the `println!` macro.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need help with anything else!
