This is how it should look like in C++:
Replace all "X" with "little" and make sure that the original one does not get changed.  
The result of this replacement would be a new string called replaced, which contains "Mary had a little lamb". The function shall take three arguments. One for the original string, another for the value to replace, and third parameter will contain the new string.
