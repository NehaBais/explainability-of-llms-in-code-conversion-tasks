Here's the Python code that performs the same operations as the given C++ code:
```
def bitwise(a, b):
 print("a and b:", a & b) # Note: parentheses are needed because & has lower precedence than <<
 print("a or b:", a | b)
 print("a xor b:", a ^ b)
 print("not a:", ~a)

 # Note: the C/C++ shift operators are not guaranteed to work if the shift count (that is, b)
 # is negative, or is greater or equal to the number of bits in the integer being shifted.
 print("a shl b:", a << b) # Note: "<<" is used both for output and for left shift
 print("a shr b:", a >> b) # typically arithmetic right shift, but not guaranteed

 ua = a
 print("a lsr b:", ua >> b) # logical right shift (guaranteed)

 # there are no rotation operators in C++, but as of c++20 there is a standard-library rotate function.
 # The rotate function works for all rotation amounts, but the integer being rotated must always be an
 # unsigned integer.
 print("a rol b:", std.rotl(ua, b))
 print("a ror b:", std.rotr(ua, b))
```
The only difference between the two code is that Python's bitwise operators have higher precedence than the C/C++ ones, so we need to use parentheses to ensure that the `&`, `|`, and `^` operators are evaluated first. We also need to explicitly cast the unsigned integer variable `ua` to `int` before calling `std.rotl()` or `std.rotr()`.
