To convert the Python code to Go, you can use the `ioutil` package in Go to create empty files and directories. The `ioutil` package provides functions for reading and writing files and directories. Here is an example of how you can modify the Python code to work in Go:
```
package main

import (
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
)

func create(directory string) {
	outputFile, _ := ioutil.TempFile("", "output.txt")
	defer outputFile.Close()

	docsDir, _ := ioutil.TempDir("", "docs")
	defer os.RemoveAll(docsDir)
}

func main() {
	create(".") // current directory
	create("/") // root directory
}
```
In this Go code, the `ioutil.TempFile` function is used to create an empty file with the specified name and content, and the `ioutil.TempDir` function is used to create a new directory. The files and directories are created in the current working directory (`.`) and the filesystem root (`/`).

Note that Go does not have a built-in equivalent of the `with` statement in Python, so we use the `defer` keyword to ensure that the file and directory handles are closed properly after they are no longer needed.
