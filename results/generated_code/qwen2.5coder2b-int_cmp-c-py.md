Sure! Below is the equivalent Python code that performs the same operations as your C code:

```python
# Prompt the user to enter two integers
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))

# Compare and print the result based on the conditions
if a < b:
    print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
elif a == b:
    print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input**: The user is prompted to enter two integers using the `input()` function, which reads a string from the user.
2. **Conversion**: These strings are converted to integers using the `int()` function.
3. **Comparison**:
   - The `if` statement checks if `a` is less than `b`, and if true, it prints the message indicating that `a` is less than `b`.
   - The `elif` (else if) statement checks if `a` is equal to `b`, and if true, it prints the message indicating that `a` is equal to `b`.
   - The `else` statement handles the case where neither of the above conditions is true (`a` is greater than `b`), and it prints the message indicating that `a` is greater than `b`.

This Python code achieves the same functionality as the C code you provided.
