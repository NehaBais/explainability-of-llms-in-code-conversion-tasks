To convert this Python code to C, we first need to declare the str variable as a char array and initialize it with the text value. Then, we can append another string literal using the += operator. Finally, we can print the contents of the variable after the operation. Here's the corresponding C code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
    char str[20] = "12345678";
    strcat(str, "9!");
    printf("%s\n", str);
    return 0;
}
```
In this code, we use the `strcat` function from the `string.h` library to append another string literal to the variable. Note that we need to include the necessary header file (`string.h`) in the beginning of the program.
