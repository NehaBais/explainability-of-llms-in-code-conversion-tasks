In C++, the functionality to rename files and directories is provided in the header file <filesystem>. However, this standard library was only introduced with C++17. If your compiler does not support C++17, you will need to use a third-party library or an alternative approach.

Here's an example using the `<filesystem>` library:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <filesystem>

int main() {
    std::filesystem::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    std::filesystem::rename("docs", "mydocs");
    std::filesystem::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    std::filesystem::rename("/docs", "/mydocs");

    return 0;
}
```

Keep in mind that the `/` prefix is used to indicate a path starting from the filesystem root, so you should have permission to access and modify files there.

If your compiler does not support C++17 or you cannot use an alternative library for file system operations, here's a workaround using standard POSIX functions:

#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Renaming in current directory:\n";
    if (rename("input.txt", "output.txt") == -1) {
        perror("rename");
    }
    if (rename("docs", "mydocs") == -1) {
        perror("rename");
    }

    std::cout << "\nRenaming in root directory:\n";
    // Note: The following requires sudo or root privileges
    if (chdir("/") == -1) {
        perror("chdir");
        return 1;
    }
    if (rename("input.txt", "output.txt") == -1) {
        perror("rename");
    }
    if (rename("docs", "mydocs") == -1) {
        perror("rename");
    }

    return 0;
}

Remember, the second part of this code snippet changes the current working directory to the root (`"/"`) with `chdir("/")`, which might require root or sudo permissions to be executed successfully. This might not be applicable or safe in all environments and is generally discouraged for production use unless you're sure about the environment's security settings.
