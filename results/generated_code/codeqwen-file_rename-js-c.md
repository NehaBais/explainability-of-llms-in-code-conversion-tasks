Unfortunately, C does not have built-in support for file manipulation or directory operations like JavaScript's FileSystemObject in ActiveX. The standard C library has limited capabilities and is not as feature-rich as the one provided by Windows API for scripting purposes.

However, it is possible to achieve such file and directory manipulations using a combination of system calls, which would be less than ideal compared to JavaScript's FileSystemObject implementation.

Here is an example of how you could potentially use the C standard library functions for renaming files and directories:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    if (rename("input.txt", "output.txt") == -1) {
        perror("Error renaming input.txt");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    
    if (chdir("/") == -1) {
        perror("Error changing directory to /");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    if (rename("c:/input.txt", "c:/output.txt") == -1) {
        perror("Error renaming c:/input.txt");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    if (chdir("/path/to/docs") == -1) {
        perror("Error changing directory to /path/to/docs");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    if (rename("docs", "mydocs") == -1) {
        perror("Error renaming docs");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    if (chdir("/path/to/c:/docs") == -1) {
        perror("Error changing directory to /path/to/c:/docs");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    if (rename("c:/docs", "c:/mydocs") == -1) {
        perror("Error renaming c:/docs");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    printf("Files and directories successfully moved\n");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

This code would attempt to move the "input.txt" file and directory named "docs" into their respective new names in the root and current working directories, respectively. It also attempts to change the current working directory for each of the operations to ensure that the paths are absolute rather than relative. 

Please note that this is a very simplified version of your code and may not work as expected if there are any issues with permissions or other errors during renaming/changing directories. Also, you'll need to replace "/path/to/docs" with the correct path where "docs" directory resides. 

In general, it is recommended to use high-level languages like JavaScript for such tasks due to their better abstraction and support for file system operations, as well as error handling.
