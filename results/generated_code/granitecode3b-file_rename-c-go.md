Sure, here's the equivalent Golang code that achieves the same functionality as the given C code, while also meeting the requirement of renaming a file and directory in both the current working directory and the root filesystem:
```
package main
import (
 "fmt"
 "os"
)
func main() {
 err := os.Rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
 if err != nil {
 fmt.Println(err)
 }
 err = os.Rename("docs", "mydocs")
 if err != nil {
 fmt.Println(err)
 }
 err = os.Rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
 if err != nil {
 fmt.Println(err)
 }
 err = os.Rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
 if err != nil {
 fmt.Println(err)
 }
}
``` 
The `os` package provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including `rename()`. The code iterates through a list of file and directory names to rename them using this function. If any errors occur during the renaming process, they are printed to the console.
