In Python, you can use the `+` operator to concatenate strings. Here's how you can convert your JavaScript code into Python:

```python
# Define the variable with a string value
s1 = "Hello"

# Append another string literal
s1 += ", World!"

# Print the result
print(s1)
```

When you run this Python code, it will print:


Hello, World!
