Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task as the Golang code:
```
text = "hello"
output = text + " literal"
print(text)
print(output)
```
The output of this Python code will be:

hello
hello literal

As you can see, the Python code accomplishes the same task as the Golang code by creating a string variable and concatenating it with another string literal. The resulting string is then assigned to another string variable for further use.
