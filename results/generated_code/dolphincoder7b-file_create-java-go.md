The equivalent Go code for creating a new empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory called "docs" in the current working directory is as follows:
```go
package main
import (
    "os"
    "path/filepath"
)
func main() {
    err := os.MkdirAll("docs", os.ModePerm)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    f, err := os.Create("output.txt")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer f.Close()

    err := os.MkdirAll("/docs", os.ModePerm)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    f, err := os.Create("/output.txt")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer f.Close()
}
```
This code creates a new directory called "docs" in the current working directory and opens a file named "output.txt". If there is an error, it will panic with the error message.

This code creates a new directory called "docs" at the root of the filesystem and opens a file named "output.txt". If there is an error, it will panic with the error message.

However, please note that both Go's os and filepath packages provide more features than what you need for this task. For example, you can use os.IsExist() to check if a directory or file already exists before creating it. You can also use os.RemoveAll() to remove a directory and its contents if necessary.
