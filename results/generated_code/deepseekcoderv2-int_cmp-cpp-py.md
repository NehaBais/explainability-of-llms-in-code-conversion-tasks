Answer: The following code converts the given C++ code into Python. There are two ways to convert this code; one way involves using Python's `input()` function and the other uses the built-in `int()` method for type conversion. This is a snippet of both implementations below:- 

```Python
# Using input() function
a = int(input("Enter first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter second integer: "))

if (a < b):
    print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
elif a == b:
    print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```

```Python
# Using int() function for type conversion 
a = input("Enter first integer: ")
b = input("Enter second integer: ")
a, b = int(a), int(b)
if (a < b):
    print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
elif a == b:
    print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```
