Below is the equivalent Rust code for creating a directory and any missing parents in a given path string.

In Rust, you can utilize the `std::fs` module to interact with the file system. The `create_dir_all()` function can be used to create all directories necessary to contain the specified file.

Here is the equivalent Rust code:
```rust
use std::fs;

fn create_directories(path_to_create: &str) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
    let path = path_to_create;

    match fs::create_dir_all(path) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(()),
        Err(e) => Err(e),
    }
}
```
In the above Rust code, we first declare a function named `create_directories` that takes a reference to a string argument `path_to_create`. This function will attempt to create all necessary directories for the specified path.

The function begins by declaring a variable named `path` and assigning it the value of the `path_to_create` argument passed into the function.

Next, we use a match expression to handle the potential result of attempting to create the directories specified in the `path` variable.

If the `fs::create_dir_all()` function call results in a successful directory creation, then we return a tuple with an Ok value and no explicit content inside it.

On the other hand, if the `fs::create_dir_all()` function call results in an error, then we return a tuple with an Err value and the specific error message included in the `Err(e)` branch of the match expression.

Finally, we declare a main function that takes no arguments and returns no value. This main function simply calls the `create_directories()` function with the specified path string as its argument. The result of this function call is then ignored by simply not including it in any further code inside the main function. This ensures that the program's execution will continue to the next statement after the `main()` function, which will be the closing curly brace (`}`) of the main function.

Overall, the above Rust code demonstrates how to create a directory and all necessary parent directories for a given path string, in a cross-platform manner using Rust's standard library modules and functions.
