The equivalent Rust code for the given JavaScript code would be as follows:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Create an empty file in the current directory and root directory
    let _ = fs::File::create("output.txt").unwrap();
    let _ = fs::File::create("/output.txt").unwrap();

    // Create an empty directory in the current directory and root directory
    let _ = std::fs::DirBuilder::new().create("docs").unwrap();
    let _ = std::fs::DirBuilder::new().create("/docs").unwrap();
}
```

Please note that due to Rust's ownership model, the `_` character is used here because we don't actually need the returned `File` or `Dir` objects for anything. Also, the call to `create` or `DirBuilder::new().create` may fail with an error if a file or directory already exists. The `unwrap()` function in this case will panic if an error occurs instead of returning it.
