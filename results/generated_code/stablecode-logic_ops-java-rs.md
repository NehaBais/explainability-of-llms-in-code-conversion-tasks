In Rust, you can write the equivalent function as follows:

```rust
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
```
In Rust, there is no need to create static methods in Rust as functions are first-class citizens in Rust. You can call this function just like any other function in your Rust code.
