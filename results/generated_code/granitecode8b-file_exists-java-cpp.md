Here is the converted code from Java to C++ that verifies whether a file called input.txt and a directory called docs exist, both in the current working directory and in the filesystem root:
```c++
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 // Verify existence of "docs/input.txt" in the current working directory
 std::ifstream file("docs/input.txt");
 if (file) {
 file.close();
 std::cout << "File exists: docs/input.txt" << std::endl;
 } else {
 std::cerr << "Error: File does not exist: docs/input.txt" << std::endl;
 }
 
 // Verify existence of "docs/input.txt" in the filesystem root
 file.open("/docs/input.txt");
 if (file) {
 file.close();
 std::cout << "File exists: /docs/input.txt" << std::endl;
 } else {
 std::cerr << "Error: File does not exist: /docs/input.txt" << std::endl;
 }
 
 return 0;
}
```
Note that in C++, the `std::ifstream` constructor opens the file for reading, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the file was successfully opened or not. If the file exists, the `std::ifstream` object is considered "true" in a boolean context, so we can use it to check if the file exists.
