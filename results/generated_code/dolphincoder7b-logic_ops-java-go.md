In Golang, the equivalent code would be as follows:
```
func logic(a bool, b bool) {
    fmt.Printf("a AND b: %v\n", a && b)
    fmt.Printf("a OR b: %v\n", a || b)
    fmt.Printf("NOT a: %v\n", !a)
}
```
This code will output the results of "and," "or," and "not" operations on both arguments as well as print them in a readable format.
