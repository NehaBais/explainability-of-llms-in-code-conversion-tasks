Sure, here's the JavaScript code that performs the same function as the Java code:
```javascript
const str = "abc";
console.log(str);
str += "def";
console.log(str);
```
In this case, we have used const keyword instead of var, which is more appropriate in JavaScript for declaring a constant value. Also note that `+=` operator is used to append the string literals at the end of the existing string variable. The contents of the variable are then printed using the console.log() function.
