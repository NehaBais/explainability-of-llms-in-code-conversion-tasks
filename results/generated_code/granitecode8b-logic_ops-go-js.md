Here's the JavaScript code that accomplishes the same task as the Golang code you provided:
```
function printLogic(a, b) {
  console.log('a and b is', a && b);
  console.log('a or b is', a || b);
  console.log('not a is', !a);
}
```
This JavaScript function takes two arguments `a` and `b`, which should be boolean values. It then uses the logical AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`) operators to perform the desired operations on the arguments and print the results to the console using `console.log()`.
