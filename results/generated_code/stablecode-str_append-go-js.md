Here is the conversion of your GoLang code to JavaScript:

```javascript
let s = '';
s += 'foo';
s += 'bar';
console.log(s);
```
This JavaScript code does exactly what your GoLang code did:
1. Declare a string variable named `s`.
2. Append the value of `'foo'` to `s`.
3. Append the value of `'bar'` to `s`.
4. Print the contents of the variable `s` after the append operation. This is done using `console.log()`, which is JavaScript's equivalent of `fmt.Print()` in GoLang.
