Here's the equivalent code in Golang:
```
package main
import (
 "fmt"
)
func compare(a, b string) {
 if a == b {
 fmt.Printf("'%s' and '%s' are lexically equal.", a, b)
 } else {
 fmt.Printf("'%s' and '%s' are not lexically equal.", a, b)
 }
 fmt.Println()

 if strings.EqualFold(a, b) {
 fmt.Printf("'%s' and '%s' are case-insensitive lexically equal.", a, b)
 } else {
 fmt.Printf("'%s' and '%s' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.", a, b)
 }
 fmt.Println()

 if a < b {
 fmt.Printf("'%s' is lexically before '%s'.", a, b)
 } else if a > b {
 fmt.Printf("'%s' is lexically after '%s'.", a, b)
 }

 if a <= b {
 fmt.Printf("'%s' is not lexically before '%s'.", a, b)
 }
 if a >= b {
 fmt.Printf("'%s' is not lexically after '%s'.", a, b)
 }

 fmt.Printf("The lexical relationship is: %d", strings.Compare(a, b))
 fmt.Printf("The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: %d", strings.CompareFold(a, b))
}
func main() {
 compare("Hello", "Hello")
 compare("5", "5.0")
 compare("java", "Java")
 compare("ĴÃVÁ", "Ĵ�VÁ")
 compare("Ĵ�VÁ", "ĵãvá")
}
```
In Golang, we can use the `==` and `!=` operators to compare two strings for exact equality and inequality, respectively. We can also use the `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` operators to compare two strings lexically. The `strings.EqualFold()` function can be used to perform a case-insensitive comparison of two strings.
The `strings.Compare()` and `strings.CompareFold()` functions can be used to compare two strings and return an integer value indicating their lexical relationship. A negative value indicates that the first string is less than the second, a positive value indicates that the first string is greater than the second, and 0 indicates that the two strings are equal.
In Golang, we don't have a built-in type for numeric strings, so we can compare them lexically using the `strings.Compare()` or `strings.CompareFold()` functions. However, if we want to treat numeric strings as numbers and perform mathematical operations on them, we can use the `strconv` package to convert them to integers or floating-point numbers.
