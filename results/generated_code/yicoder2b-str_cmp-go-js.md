This code was originally written in Golang and provides a detailed description of its string comparison capabilities. The main features presented include the use of Go's standard library for performing string comparisons, as well as some other language-specific extensions to handle Unicode characters.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    // Comparing two strings for exact equality:
    c := "cat"
    d := "dog"
    if c == d {
        fmt.Println(c, "is bytewise identical to", d)
    } else {
        fmt.Println(c, "is not bytewise identical to", d)
    }

    // Comparing two strings for inequality:
    if c != d {
        fmt.Println(c, "is bytewise different from", d)
    } else {
        fmt.Println(c, "is not bytewise different from", d)
    }

    // Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other:
    if c < d {
        fmt.Println(c, "is lexically bytewise less than", d)
    } else {
        fmt.Println(c, "is not lexically bytewise less than", d)
    }

    // Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after than the other:
    if c > d {
        fmt.Println(c, "is lexically bytewise greater than", d)
    } else {
        fmt.Println(c, "is not lexically bytewise greater than", d)
    }

    // Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before or equal to the other and/or order them in reverse:
    if c <= d {
        fmt.Println(c, "is lexically bytewise less than or equal to", d)
    } else {
        fmt.Println(c, "is not lexically bytewise less than or equal to", d)
    }

    if c >= d {
        fmt.Println(c, "is lexically bytewise greater than or equal to", d)
    } else {
        fmt.Println(c, "is not lexically bytewise greater than or equal to", d)
    }

    // Case insensitive comparison:
    eqf := `when interpreted as UTF-8 and compared under Unicode
simple case folding rules.`
    if strings.EqualFold(c, d) {
        fmt.Println(c, "equal to", d, eqf)
    } else {
        fmt.Println(c, "not equal to", d, eqf)
    }

    // The other kinds of string comparisons that the language provides, particularly as it relates to Unicode and collation are not handled by Go's standard library but are found in the Go sub-repository at golang.org/x/text which supports Unicode normalisation, case folding, collation tables and locale sensitive comparisons.
