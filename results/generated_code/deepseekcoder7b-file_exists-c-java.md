Below is the equivalent Java code for your C program. Note that in this Java version, we are using `Files` and `Paths` classes from java.nio package to check if a file or directory exists. This will work with both relative paths (e.g., "docs" and "input.txt") and absolute paths ("/docs" and "/input.txt").
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
        System.out.println("input.txt is a regular file? " + Files.isRegularFile(Paths.get("input.txt")));
        System.out.println("docs is a directory? " + Files.isDirectory(Paths.get("docs")));
        System.out.println("/input.txt is a regular file? " + Files.isRegularFile(Paths.get("/input.txt")));
        System.out.println("/docs is a directory? " + Files.isDirectory(Paths<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>("/docs")));
    }
}
```
This code will print "true" if the file or directory exists, and "false" otherwise. 

Note: This Java version may not work on all systems as C program, because it depends on the specific environment your application runs in (i.e., where is root directory of the filesystem). The `Files.isRegularFile` and `Files.isDirectory` methods are platform-independent and use the underlying file system to check if a given path exists and if it's a regular file or a directory.
