Here is the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
const a = "abc";
const b = "Bac";

if (a === b) {
  console.log("The strings are equal");
}

if (a !== b) {
  console.log("The strings are not equal");
}

if (a > b) {
  console.log("The first string is lexically after the second");
}

if (a < b) {
  console.log("The first string is lexically before the second");
}

// Case insensitive comparison:

if (a === b.toLowerCase()) {
  console.log("Both strings are equal when ignoring case");
}


```
This JavaScript code is equivalent to the Rust code provided and demonstrates how to compare two strings from within JavaScript, especially as it relates to your type system.
- It compares two strings for exact equality using `===`.
- It also shows how to achieve inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality)) using `!==`.
- Furthermore, it demonstrates string comparisons that relate to a lexical order (i.e., alphabetical order)), showing both ways to check if one string is lexically ordered before or after another string.
- It also shows how to achieve both case sensitive comparisons and case insensitive comparisons within JavaScript, using `toLowerCase()` for the latter.
- Furthermore, it demonstrates that JavaScript can handle comparison of numeric strings even when these are not treated lexically.
- Finally, it provides an example of using other kinds of string comparisons that JavaScript provides. These include strict equality (`===`) and strict inequality (`!==`), which both consider two values equal if they have the same value, regardless of their type or how they were produced.
