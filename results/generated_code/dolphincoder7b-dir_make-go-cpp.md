This task is to create a directory and any missing parents in Golang by using the os.MkdirAll() function. However, you cannot implement it directly in C++ because there is no direct equivalent for this function in C++. Therefore, we can use the same method in Golang using a library like "std::filesystem" or "boost::filesystem".

Here's how you would convert this code to C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>
namespace fs = boost::filesystem;
int main() {
    std::string path = "/tmp/some/path/to/dir";
    if (!fs::exists(path)) {
        fs::create_directories(path);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a directory and any missing parents by using the "create_directories" function provided by Boost library. If you want to use it in C++ directly without including additional libraries, please consult the documentation for the create_directories function in Boost or the mkdir() function in POSIX standard C library (C). The following link provides an example on how to create a directory in C: [How can I create a directory in C?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2300684/how-can-i-create-a-directory-in-c)

#include <iostream> 
#include <sys/stat.h> 

int main() { 
    const char *path = "/tmp/some/path/to/dir"; 

    if (mkdir(path, 0770)) {
        std::cerr << "Error creating directory." << std::endl; 
        return 1; 
    }
    return 0; 
}

Please note that Boost library is much more powerful and robust than the POSIX standard C library. If you need to use a specific function from Boost or need to manage directories in a different way, consider using the library directly rather than resorting to system-specific APIs.
