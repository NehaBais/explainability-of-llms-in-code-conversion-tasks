Sure, here's the converted code in Golang:
```go
package main
import (
 "fmt"
 "strings"
)
func main() {
 args := strings.Split(os.Args[1], " ")
 a, _ := strconv.Atoi(args[0])
 b, _ := strconv.Atoi(args[1])

 sum := a + b
 difference := a - b
 product := a * b
 division := a / b
 remainder := a % b

 fmt.Printf("a + b = %dnn", sum)
 fmt.Printf("a - b = %dnn", difference)
 fmt.Printf("a * b = %dnn", product)
 fmt.Printf("a / b = %dnn", division)
 fmt.Printf("a % b = %dn", remainder)
}
```
In this code, we first get the two integers from the command line arguments using `strings.Split` and `strconv.Atoi`. We then perform the arithmetic operations and store the results in variables. Finally, we use `fmt.Printf` to print out the results with the desired format.
Note that there is no error handling in this code since we are not performing any I/O or other operations that could potentially fail.
