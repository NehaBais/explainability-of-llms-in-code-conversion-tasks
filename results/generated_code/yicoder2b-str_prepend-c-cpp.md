The C code provided is written in C language. It initializes a character array (str) to contain the text "my String". Then it assigns the string literal "Changed " to another variable (cstr), concatenates this with the content of str (after being duplicated by `strdup(str)`) and prints out the result.

This is how the equivalent code in C++ would look like:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    string str = "my String";
    string cstr = "Changed ";
    str = cstr + str;
    cout << str << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
