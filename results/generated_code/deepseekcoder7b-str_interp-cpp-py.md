The Python version of the code would be as follows:

```python
original = "Mary had a X lamb."
toBeReplaced = "X"
replacement = "big"
newString = original.replace(toBeReplaced, replacement)
print("String after replacement:", newString)
```

In Python, the `str.replace()` function is used to replace occurrences of a specified character (or substring) with another one. Here it's being used to replace 'X' in "Mary had a X lamb." with 'big'. The result is then printed out using `print()`.
