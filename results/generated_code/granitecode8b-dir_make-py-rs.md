Here's a Rust implementation of the `mkdirp` function:
```rust
use std::fs;
fn mkdirp(path: &str) -> fs::Result<()> {
 fs::create_dir_all(path)
}
```
This implementation uses the `std::fs` module to create directories. The `create_dir_all` function recursively creates all directories in the given path, including any missing parents. If the directory already exists, it returns successfully without doing anything.
