Here's the Python code that performs the same task as the C code you provided:
```python
def print_logic(a, b):
 print(f"a and b is {a and b}")
 print(f"a or b is {a or b}")
 print(f"not a is {not a}")
```
This Python function takes two boolean values as input (`a` and `b`) and uses the logical operators to calculate the result of "and", "or", and "not" on these inputs. The results are then printed to the console using string formatting.
