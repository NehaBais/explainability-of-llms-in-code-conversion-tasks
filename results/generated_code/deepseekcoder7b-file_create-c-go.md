The equivalent Golang code is as follows. Note that unlike C, Go doesn't provide a direct function to create an empty directory or file. Therefore, you need to use the os package in conjunction with ioutil and fs packages for this purpose. The 0750 permission is equivalent to drwxr-x--- (read, write, execute) for the owner, and read, execute for the group and others.

```go
package main

import (
	"io/ioutil"
	"log"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)

func createFile(name string) {
	dir := filepath.Dir(name)
	_ = os.MkdirAll(dir, 0750)

	file, err := os.OpenFile(name, os.O_CREATE|os.O_TRUNC|os.O_WRONLY, 0640)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to create file: %s", name)
	}
	_ = file.Close()
}

func main() {
    // Create files "here" in the current working directory and root
	for _, path := range []string{"output.txt", "/output.txt"} {
		createFile(path)
	}
    
	// Creates an empty dir "docs" here in the current working directory 
	// and root (equivalent to mkdir -p command).
	for _, dir := range []string{"docs", "/docs"} {
		err := os.MkdirAll(dir, 0750)
		if err != nil && !os.IsExist(err) {
			log.Fatalf("failed to create directory: %s", dir)
		}
	}
}
```

This code will create an empty file "output.txt" in the current working directory and in root ("/"). The permissions are set to rw-r----- for the file ("0640") and rwxr-x--- for the directories. 

Do note that creating a directory at the filesystem root requires super user privileges, which cannot be granted on all systems. It's generally not recommended to create files or directories in the root directory due to potential security issues.
