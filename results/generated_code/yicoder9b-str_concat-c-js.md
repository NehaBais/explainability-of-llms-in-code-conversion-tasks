Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your C program:

```JavaScript
let s1 = 'hello';
console.log('Original String:', s1);

let s2 = s1 + ' literal';
console.log('Concatenated String:', s2);
```

In this JavaScript version of the code, we are creating string variables and using the `+` operator to concatenate strings with another string literal. The content of these variables is then printed out in a similar way to how it was done in your C program. Note that JavaScript does not require the use of `free()` to deallocate memory as it is handled automatically by the browser's Garbage Collection mechanism.
