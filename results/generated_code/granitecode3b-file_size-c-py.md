Here's the Python code that performs the same task:
```python
import os
import sys
def file_size(filename):
 try:
 st_size = os.stat(filename).st_size
 except OSError:
 print("File not found:", filename)
 return st_size
input_file_path = "input.txt"
current_directory_size = file_size(input_file_path)
print("Current directory size:", current_directory_size, "bytes")
root_directory_size = file_size("/")
print("Root directory size:", root_directory_size, "bytes")
```
This code uses the `os` module to get the size of a file. The `file_size()` function takes a filename as an argument and returns the size of the file in bytes. It also handles errors by printing a message if the file doesn't exist.
The code then defines two variables, `input_file_path`, which is the path to the input file in the current working directory, and `root_directory_size`, which is the size of the root directory. Finally, it calls the `file_size()` function with both paths and prints out the sizes.
