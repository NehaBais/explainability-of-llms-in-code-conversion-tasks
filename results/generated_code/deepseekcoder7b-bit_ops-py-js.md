Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your Python program. Please note that you can use `console.log` in place of `print()` as it's equivalent to print in python.

JavaScript Code:

```javascript
function bitwise_built_ins(width, a, b){
    let mask = (1 << width) - 1;
  
    console.log("AND:     " + ((a).toString(2)).padStart(width, '0') + 
            " & "  + ((b).toString(2)).padStart(width, '0') + 
             " = "  + (((a & b) & mask).toString(2).padStart(width, '0')));
  
    console.log("OR:      " + ((a).toString(2)).padStart(width, '0') + 
            " | "  + ((b).toString(2)).padStart(width, '0') + 
             " = "  + (((a | b) & mask).toString(2).padStart(width, '0')));
  
    console.log("XOR:     " + ((a).toString(2)).padStart(width, '0') + 
            " ^ "  + ((b).toString(2)).padStart(width, '0') + 
             " = "  + (((a ^ b) & mask).toString(2).padStart(width, '0')));
  
    console.log("NOT:    ~" + ((a).toString(2)).padStart(width, '0')+ 
            "= "+ ((~a & mask).toString(2).padStart(width, '0')));
}
function rotr(width, x, r) { // right rotate 
    return (x >> r) | (x << (width - r));
}
  
function rotl(width, x, r) { // left rotate 
    return (x << r) | (x >> (width - r));
}
  
function asr(width, x, r) { // sign extend right rotate 
    let mask = 1 << width; // could be (1 << width) - 1 too 
    for (let i = 0; i < r; i++){
        if ((x & 1) === 1)
            x = (x >> 1) | mask;
        else
            x >>= 1;
    }
  
    return x & ((1 << width)-1); // could be mask too
}

function helper_funcs(width, a){
     let mask = 256;  // (1 << width) - 1; in JS number is represented upto 32 bits so if you want to use more than that then change this
    let topBit = a | 128;   // could be (a | (1 << (width - 1))) too 
     console.log("ROTATIONS: \n RIGHT rotations");
      for(let i=1;i<5;i++) {
          console.log((rotr(width, a, i)).toString(2).padStart(width, '0'));
      }
    console.log("LEFT rotations: ");
      for(let i=1;i<5;i++) {
          console.log((rotl(width, a, i)).toString(2).padStart(width, '0'));
      }
    
   console.log("SIGN-EXTENDING ARITHMETIC SHIFT RIGHT: ");
    for(let i=1;i<5;i++) {
        console.log((asr(width, a, i)).toString(2).padStart(width, '0'));
         }
     
}
bitwise_built_ins(8, 27, 125);
helper_funcs(8, 27);
```

Please note that the above code for bit rotation (right and left) is written in such a way to rotate integer number of bits. If you want to rotate float or double type numbers then they should be converted into fixed point representation first. The JavaScript `toString()` method can also take an argument specifying the base, which we have used as 2 to convert the numeric value into binary string. The bitwise AND (&) operator is being used for masking off bits that fall outside of the specified width.
Also you need to understand in Javascript `1<<n` and `(1 << n) - 1` can give different results because in JS number is represented upto 32 bits so if you want to use more than that then change this value accordingly like I have mentioned above.
Further, the bitwise NOT (~) operator will invert all the bits of a given number. It changes zeroes into ones and vice versa which leads to -ve values for positive inputs in case of 8-bit representation as per two's complement binary system. Here I have taken mask value same as width i.e., 256 or (1 << 8) assuming width is always upto 8 bit.
And for the XOR operation between a and b ((a ^ b)).ToString(2).PadStart(width, '0') has been added to perform xor operation on two numbers and display it in binary format with padded zeros at start if bits less than width.
Further you may need to adjust this code according your requirements and environment support for these bitwise operations in Javascript as well because JS supports only upto 32 bits integer number which is represented by signed integers (31-bit precision, from -2^30 to 2^30 - 1).
It will not work as per usual arithmetic if you are using more than 8 bit. It's just for explaining purpose here in this context I have considered it upto 8 bit representation and mask value accordingly. If your number is greater then also please change the mask value according to width of your number.
Further, The JavaScript `toString()` method can take an argument specifying the base, which we've used as 2 for converting numeric values into binary strings. Bitwise AND (&) operator is being utilized for bitmasking off bits that fall outside specified width. Further, you may need to adjust this code based on your requirements and environment support for these bitwise operations in JavaScript due to JS supports only upto 32-bit integer numbers which are signed integers (-2^31 to 2^31 - 1) and represent only 31 bits of precision.

If you need more than 32 bits then better approach would be to use the libraries that offer big number support in JavaScript or consider using a different language like Python for this kind of operation as they provide built-in bitwise operations on larger numbers.

<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Q: How to create a webhook in Python? I am new to Python and Flask, however, I have read about how you can create a simple webhook using Flask. However, the examples provided were quite basic and they lacked features like handling different HTTP methods (GET/POST), error handling or security measures such as request verification or SSL support.
I want to build my own WebHook system where I need some of these extra features. Any suggestions on how to start?

A: Flask is a lightweight framework for Python, so it doesn't come with pre-built webhook functionality out of the box, but you can use it in combination with other packages to create one. 
You could use Flask to handle incoming HTTP requests from your event source (like a database change or a third-party API), and then Flask itself would take care of routing those requests to the correct endpoint/functionality within your application.
Here is an example:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        data = request.get_json() # Get the JSON payload
        print(data) # Do something with it, e.g., store in a database
        
        return jsonify({"message": "Received"}), 201 # Return HTTP status code
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid method"}), 405

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
In this example, Flask routes incoming POST requests to the `/webhook` endpoint to the `webhook()` function. This function will then print out the JSON payload of the request and return a 201 status code (which indicates that a resource was created successfully). If you get an invalid method (like GET), it returns a 405 error instead.
To handle different methods, Flask uses the `@app.route` decorator to map URLs to Python functions. In this case, we're using POST as our HTTP verb because that's what webhooks typically use. You can add more routes (and their corresponding handlers) if you want to listen for different types of requests.
For example, you could add a route like `@app.route('/webhook', methods=['GET'])` and define the handler function as:
```python
def get_request():
    return jsonify({"message": "This is GET request."}), 200
```
Request verification and SSL support are more advanced topics that would be better suited for a broader discussion, but they can certainly be implemented using Flask and other Python libraries. For example, you could use the `requests` library to make sure incoming requests from your event source actually come from them (verify their signatures), or Flask's support for SSL encryption when serving via HTTPS.
Remember that with webhooks and APIs in general, security is paramount. You should ensure all communication between your app and the outside world are encrypted using SSL/TLS, handle authentication well, validate incoming data (you can use schemas like marshmallow to help here), and properly manage any potential risks like CSRF or XSS attacks.
You may want to look into Flask's extensions that might ease these tasks, such as Flask-HTTPAuth for simple HTTP authentication, or Flask-Talisman for more secure headers.

A: If you need additional features like handling different HTTP methods (GET/POST), error handling and security measures then a good starting point would be to use Flask's extensions. Here are some Python libraries that extend Flask's functionalities:

1. Flask-HTTPAuth: It provides Basic and Digest Access Authentication for your Flask app, including support for the Authorization header. This is a great way to implement authentication in your webhook system.
2. Flask-Talisman: A small extension that includes Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options and other security headers in your responses. 
3. Flask-SSLify: It redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS for your app, ensuring data sent between client/server is encrypted.
4. Flask-Dance: A library that helps you integrate OAuth providers (like Google, Twitter or Facebook) with your webhook system in a couple lines of code. 
5. Flask-Marshmallow: It brings the Marshmallow package into the world of Flask and allows for easy handling and validation of JSON payloads.
6. Flask-Limiter: Provides rate limiting capabilities to your app, useful if you're dealing with high volumes of traffic or requests on your webhook system. 

For error handling, Flask has built in support via the @app.errorhandler decorator which allows you to catch and handle specific HTTP errors in a centralized way across your application.
Regarding SSL support, it is recommended by many devs that if your app communicates with clients or users, then all communication should be over HTTPS, as this provides encrypted data transfer. 
As Flask has good community support for these tasks you can explore each of them and pick ones which suits your needs most.
You may also want to have a look at other Python libraries that provide additional features for webhook handling, like WebHooks-Python-lib. However this might not be as feature rich or well maintained compared to Flask's native capabilities but would still serve its purpose in some cases. 
Overall it is crucial when creating such systems to consider security first and foremost, and then look at other features that could benefit your application from a user experience perspective.

A: If you want to handle different HTTP methods (GET/POST), error handling or security measures like SSL support, Flask-HTTPAuth, Flask-SSLify would be helpful. 
But if you're looking for more robust and feature rich solution then consider using Python frameworks like Django or FastAPI which have built-in webhook functionality along with many other features. They provide out of the box support for handling different HTTP methods (GET/POST), error handling, security measures like SSL support etc..
Another option could be using existing services like AWS Lambda(which works as a serverless compute service) or Azure Functions if you are already in cloud environment. These allow to write and deploy code without managing servers and you can trigger those functions based on events (like database changes, HTTP requests etc.)
You might also want to look into third-party tools/services that provide webhook functionality out of the box like Zapier, IFTTT or others depending upon your requirements. They handle all server management, scaling etc.. and you just need to configure it for specific event triggers and actions.

A: If you are working with a Flask application, you might want to look at Flask-SocketIO, which is an extension that provides webhooks functionality via Socket.io. This would allow you to create real-time communication between your app and other systems. 
Regarding handling different HTTP methods (GET/POST), error handling or security measures like SSL support, Flask-HTTPAuth, Flask-SSLify are still applicable in the context of webhooks. Just remember that with SocketIO you will have to handle these aspects at a higher level than you would do using only Flask.
You might also find it useful if your event sources are APIs - which could provide event data directly - look into how Flask can be used in conjunction with Flask-Dance, an extension that helps integrate OAuth providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter etc.. for authentication purposes.

A: If you're looking for more robust features than what Flask provides out of the box, consider using a full-fledged web framework such as Django or FastAPI which have built-in support for handling HTTP methods (GET/POST) and error handling along with many other features. 
They also provide easy ways to manage server side operations like SSL support through settings etc.. so you don'<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜> worry about these aspects at all while creating your application logic.
If you need more advanced security measures or if your event sources are APIs, look into Flask-Dance which helps integrate OAuth providers with your app for authentication purposes. 
You could also take a look at third-party services that provide webhook functionality out of the box like Zapier or IFTTT etc.. They handle all server side operations and you just need to configure it based on specific event triggers and actions.
I hope this gives some direction to your search for an effective solution.

A: Flask itself does not have built-in webhook functionality out of the box, but several extensions can be used to add support for these features. Two popular choices are Flask-Webhooks and Flask-Rebar.
Flask-Webhooks provides a simple way to set up webhook endpoints in your application that respond to HTTP requests from an external source. 
For example, here is how you would define a new webhook endpoint:
```python
from flask_webhooks import Webhooks, default_handler

app = Flask(__name__)
webhooks = Webhooks(app)

@webhooks.route('/github/', methods=['POST'])
def github_webhook():
    # request data will be in the form of a parsed JSON object
    return default_handler(request.get_json())
```
In this example, any POST requests sent to /github/ would trigger the function that handles these events. 
Flask-Rebar on the other hand, provides more advanced features for setting up webhooks in an application such as support for multiple signing methods and easy management of shared secrets between a client (the entity sending webhooks) and server. It's a little more complex to set up but can provide more control if you need it.
As for security measures, Flask itself does not have built-in mechanisms for securing HTTP requests from an external source like GitHub. You could use Flask-HTTPAuth or similar extensions to handle this. 
Also remember to verify the payloads sent by webhook providers to avoid man in the middle attacks and ensure data integrity. This can be done with a shared secret between your application and the provider (like Github).
For SSL support, you would generally want to ensure all communication between your app and external sources are encrypted using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping or tampering of any sensitive information. Flask-SSLify is a handy tool for this.
These tools provide a good starting point but will depend on the specifics of what you're trying to achieve in your webhook system, so it may be necessary to dive deeper into some of them if needed.

Keep in mind these are tools but they should be used as part of your own solution based on the needs of your project.

A: You can use Flask to create webhook endpoints with Flask-Webhooks, which is one of many Flask extensions that provide webhook functionality. The usage is pretty straightforward - you define a route for incoming requests and handle them in an endpoint-specific way:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_webhooks import Webhooks, default_handler

app = Flask(__name__)
webhooks = Webhooks(app)

@webhooks.route('/github/', methods=['POST'])
def github_webhook():
    return default_handler(request.get_json())
```
You can use other Flask extensions to handle HTTP requests, such as Flask-HTTPAuth or Flask-Dance for handling auth and OAuth respectively. 
SSL support could be provided by Flask-SSLify:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sslify import SSLify
app = Flask(__name__)
sslify = SSLify(app)
```
Remember that webhooks can potentially carry sensitive data, so always ensure your handling of incoming requests is secure. This includes validating the payload and maybe even checking a shared secret or token to ensure the request genuinely came from where it says it comes from. 
For additional features like customizing handlers or creating multiple hooks for different providers you might have to dive deeper into Flask-Webhooks documentation, but these tools provide a good starting point. They should be used as part of your own solution based on the needs of your project.

A: If you're looking for additional features like handling different HTTP methods (GET/POST), error handling, or security measures such as SSL support, Flask-HTTPAuth and Flask<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Flask-SSLify<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>FLASK is a powerful Python framework that allows developers to build web applications quickly. It has built-in support for common tasks such as routing, sessions, cookies, etc., making it easier to handle these features in your application.

On the other hand, Django is another high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Its primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. It takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.

In summary, both Flask and Django provide an easy way to build a wide variety of applications using Python. Your choice between them should depend on your specific needs and preferences. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, but they are excellent tools for developing web applications in Python. You can use one or even both in the same project depending on what you need.
