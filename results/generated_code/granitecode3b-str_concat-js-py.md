Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task:
```python
s = "hello"
t = s + " there!"
print(t)
```
The output of this code will be:

hello there!

As you can see, the string variable `t` contains the value of the original string variable `s` concatenated with the additional string literal `" there!"`.
