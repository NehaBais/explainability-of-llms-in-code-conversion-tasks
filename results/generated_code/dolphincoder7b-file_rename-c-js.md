The JavaScript version of the given C code is:

```javascript
rename('input.txt', 'output.txt');
rename('docs', 'mydocs');
rename('/input.txt', '/output.txt');
rename('/docs', '/mydocs');
```
This will rename files named "input.txt" to "output.txt", directories named "docs" to "mydocs", and any other file or directory by the same name in the current working directory to its new name. If there is already a file with the new name, it will be overwritten.
Note that the JavaScript `rename` function is asynchronous, so you may need to use callbacks or Promises to do anything further after renaming files.

For renaming files and directories in the filesystem root, replace `rename('input.txt', 'output.txt');` with `rename('/input.txt', '/output.txt');` and so on. 

In JavaScript, file/directory renames are generally implemented using the underlying operating system's APIs (e.g., Windows' `MoveFileExA`, POSIX's `renameat2`, etc.). If you prefer to use purely JS solutions for renaming, you can use libraries like `fs-extra` or `fs-move`. These libraries will abstract away the differences between different platforms and provide a consistent API.
