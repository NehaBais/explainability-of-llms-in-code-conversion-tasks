The provided Golang code is performing the following actions: 
1. Renames a file from "input.txt" to "output.txt".
2. Renames a directory from "docs" to "mydocs".
3. Renames an absolute path file ("/input.txt") to "/output.txt".
4. Renames an absolute path directory ("/docs") to "/mydocs".

However, JavaScript does not have a direct equivalent for these operations on directories or absolute paths. The closest in JavaScript is the `fs` module's `rename()` function, which can rename files but not directories.

If you want the equivalent JavaScript code, it would be:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

function renameFilesAndDirs(from, to) {
  if (!fs.existsSync(from)){
    console.log(`No file or directory '${from}'`); 
    return; // Exit if the source does not exist
  }
  try{
      // Rename files/directories in both "here" and "/filesystem root"
     fs.renameSync(from, to)
       console.log(`Rename '${from}' to '${to}'`); 
    
  } catch (error){ console.log('Error renaming file or directory: ', error)};
}

// Call the function with the source and destination paths you want to rename
renameFilesAndDirs("input.txt", "output.txt")
renameFilesAndDirs("docs", "mydocs")
```
This code will log a message if it fails to rename any file or directory, and if successful, will rename the file/directory to its new location. It does not rename an absolute path but behaves as if you had specified the paths relative to the current working directory. 

Remember that this solution does not actually alter these directories in your filesystem since it uses synchronous operations which are less efficient than asynchronous ones (like fs.promises) and it doesn't check for the existence of source files or directories before renaming them. These considerations make it suitable only for testing or small scripts where performance doesn't matter. If you need to perform such operations in a production environment, consider using `fs.promises` for better performance.
