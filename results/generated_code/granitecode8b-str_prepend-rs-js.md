Here's the equivalent JavaScript code that meets your requirements:
```
let s = "World";
let message = "Hello " + s;
console.log(message);
```
In this code, we first declare a string variable `s` and assign it the value "World". Then we create another string variable `message` by concatenating the string literal "Hello " with the value of `s`. Finally, we print the value of `message` to the console.
