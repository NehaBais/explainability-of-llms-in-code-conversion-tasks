Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for your JavaScript function. Note that in Python, bitwise operations are performed differently compared to JavaScript.

Python does not have a direct bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT operators like JavaScript. However, you can use bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`) along with binary numbers to achieve similar results.

Here is the equivalent code:

```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    print(f"a AND b: {a & b}")
    print(f"a OR b: {a | b}")
    print(f"a XOR b: {a ^ b}")
    print(f"NOT a: ~{a}")
    print(f"a << b: {a << b}") # left shift
    print(f"a >> b: {a >> b}") # right shift
    print(f"a >>> b: {a >> b}") # logical right shift

# Example usage:
bitwise(5, 3)
```

This code defines a function `bitwise` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`, performs the specified bitwise operations on them, and prints the results. Note that in Python, left shifts (`<<`) and arithmetic right shifts (`>>`) are equivalent, but logical right shifts (`>>>`) do not have an equivalent operator.
