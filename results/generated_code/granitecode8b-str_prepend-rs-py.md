Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task as the Rust code you provided:
```
s = "World"
s = "Hello " + s
print(s)
```
In this Python code, we first create a string variable `s` and assign it the value `"World"`. Then, we prepend the string `"Hello "` to `s` using the `+` operator. Finally, we print the value of `s` to the console using the `print()` function. The output of this code will be `"Hello World"`.
