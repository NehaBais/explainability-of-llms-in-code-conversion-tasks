Here is the Java code that achieves the same requirement as the given C++ code:
```java
import java.io.File;
public class Rename {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 File input = new File("input.txt");
 File output = new File("output.txt");
 File docs = new File("docs");
 File mydocs = new File("mydocs");
 input.renameTo(output);
 docs.renameTo(mydocs);
 File rootInput = new File("/");
 File rootOutput = new File("/");
 rootInput = new File(rootInput, "input.txt");
 rootOutput = new File(rootOutput, "output.txt");
 rootDocs = new File(rootDocs, "docs");
 rootMydocs = new File(rootMydocs, "mydocs");
 rootInput.renameTo(rootOutput);
 rootDocs.renameTo(rootMydocs);
 }
}
``` 
This Java code first creates two `File` objects for the input and output files, and then renames them using the `renameTo()` method. It does the same thing with a directory called "docs" and a directory called "mydocs". 
The second part of the code is a bit more complicated. It creates four more `File` objects that represent the input and output files in the root directory, and then renames them using the same method as before. 
Note that this Java code assumes that the user has the necessary permissions to rename the files and directories. If they do not have the necessary permissions, an exception will be thrown.
