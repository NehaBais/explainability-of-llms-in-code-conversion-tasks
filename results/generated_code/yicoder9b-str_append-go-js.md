Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your Golang program:

```javascript
let s = "";
s += "foobar";
console.log(s);
```

In this JavaScript version, we're simply declaring a variable `s` and appending strings to it in two steps using the `+=` operator. Afterwards, we use `console.log()` function to print out the content of variable `s`.
