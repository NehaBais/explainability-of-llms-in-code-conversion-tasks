 Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Rust code snippet:

```python
def main():
    # only same types can be compared
    # str and str or &str and &str
    # exception: strict equality and inequality also work on &str and str
    a = "abc"
    b = "Bac".upper()  # Convert to uppercase for case-insensitive comparison

    # Strings are coerced to str when borrowed and needed
    if a == b:
        print("The strings are equal")
    if a != b:
        print("The strings are not equal")
    if a > b:
        print("The first string is lexically after the second")
    if a < b:
        print("The first string is lexically before the second")
    if a >= b:
        print("The first string is not lexically before the second")
    if a <= b:
        print("The first string is not lexically after the second")

    # case-insensitives:

    # equality
    # this avoids new allocations
    if a.lower() == b.lower():
        print("Both strings are equal when ignoring case")

    # everything else, create owned str, then compare as above
    a2 = a.upper()
    b2 = b.upper()

    # repeat checks

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Comparing two strings for exact equality and inequality:**
   - In Python, you can directly use the `==` operator for equality and the `!=` operator for inequality.
   ```python
   if a == b: print("The strings are equal")
   if a != b: print("The strings are not equal")
   ```

2. **Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before or after the other:**
   - In Python, you can use comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) directly on strings.
   ```python
   if a > b: print("The first string is lexically after the second")
   if a < b: print("The first string is lexically before the second")
   if a >= b: print("The first string is not lexically before the second")
   if a <= b: print("The first string is not lexically after the second")
   ```

3. **Case sensitive comparisons:**
   - Case sensitivity is automatically handled by Python's comparison operators.

4. **Case insensitive comparisons:**
   - In Python, you can convert strings to lowercase using the `lower()` method and then compare them.
   ```python
   if a.lower() == b.lower(): print("Both strings are equal when ignoring case")
   ```

5. **Comparison of numeric strings if these are not treated lexically:**
   - If you need to treat numeric strings lexically, you can convert them to integers or floats and compare them numerically.
   ```python
   # Example: Convert both strings to integers and compare
   a_num = int(a)
   b_num = int(b)
   if a_num == b_num: print("Numeric strings are equal")
   ```

This Python code mirrors the functionality of the provided Rust code, including handling case-insensitive comparisons by converting strings to lowercase before comparison.
