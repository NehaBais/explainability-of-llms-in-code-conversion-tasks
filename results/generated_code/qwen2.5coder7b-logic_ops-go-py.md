Here's how you can write the same function in Python:

```python
def print_logic(a, b):
    print(f"a and b is {a and b}")
    print(f"a or b is {a or b}")
    print(f"not a is {not a}")

# usage
print_logic(True, False)
```

In this code, `and`, `or`, and `not` are Python's built-in logical operators.
