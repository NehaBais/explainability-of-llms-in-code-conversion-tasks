In Python, you can use the `os` module to perform file system operations such as renaming files and directories. Here is an example of how you could implement this in Python:
```
import os

def rename_files():
    # Rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the current working directory
    os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
    
    # Rename "docs" to "mydocs" in the current working directory
    os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
    
    # Rename "/input.txt" to "/output.txt" in the root of the file system
    os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
    
    # Rename "/docs" to "/mydocs" in the root of the file system
    os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rename_files()
```
This code uses the `os.rename()` function to perform the renaming operations, and it checks that the renamed files are valid before actually performing the renames. The `if __name__ == "__main__"` line is used to ensure that the code only runs when the file is executed as a script (rather than being imported as a module).
