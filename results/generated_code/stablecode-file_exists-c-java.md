Here's the equivalent Java code for your C code. 

This code uses `java.io` and `java.nio` packages to perform file operations. This code will check if a file named 'input.txt' exists in the current working directory, as well as checking if it exists in the root directory of the filesystem. It also checks if a directory named 'docs' exists in both the current working directory and the root directory of the filesystem.

```java
import java.io.File;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Check for input.txt file in current working directory
        File file1 = new File("input.txt");
        boolean exists1 = file1.exists();
        System.out.println("Does the file 'input.txt' exist in the current working directory? " + (exists1 ? "Yes" : "No")));
        // Check for input.txt file and docs directory in root of filesystem
        File file2 = new File("/input.txt");
        boolean exists2 = file2.exists();
        File dir3 = new File("/docs");
        boolean exists3 = dir3.exists();
        System.out.println("Does the file '/input.txt' exist in the root directory of the filesystem? " + (exists2 ? "Yes" : "No")));
        System.out.println("Does the directory '/docs' exist in the root directory of the filesystem? " + (exists3 ? "Yes" : "No"))));
    }
}
```
Please make sure to add necessary exception handling for a more robust code.
