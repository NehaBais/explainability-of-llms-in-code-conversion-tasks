```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("12345678");
    s.insert(0, '0'); // by concatenation
    println!("{}", s);
}
```

This Rust code does the same thing as your Python script. It creates a `String` variable with an initial value of "12345678", then prepends the character '0' to it and prints out the result.
