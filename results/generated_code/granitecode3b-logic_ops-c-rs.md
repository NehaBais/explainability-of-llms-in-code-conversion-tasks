Sure! Here's the equivalent Rust code:
```rust
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
 println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
 println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
 println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
```
This function takes two boolean values as input (denoted by `bool` in Rust), performs the logical operations on them, and prints the results to the console.
