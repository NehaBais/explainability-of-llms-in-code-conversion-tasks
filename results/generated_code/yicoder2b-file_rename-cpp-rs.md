The equivalent code in Rust would be:

```rust
use std::fs::rename;

fn main() {
  // rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" and "docs" to "mydocs" 
  let src = String::from("input.txt");
  let dest = String::from("output.txt");
  rename(&src, &dest).unwrap();

  let src_root = String::from("/input.txt");
  let dest_root = String::from("/output.txt");
  rename(&src_root, &dest_root).expect("Failed to rename root input file");

  let docs = String::from("docs");
  let mydocs = String::from("mydocs");
  // The following renaming operations do not work as "/docs" and "/mydocs" are in different filesystems. You would need to use `rename_at` or equivalent function provided by the underlying filesystem, which is hidden from you in this example because it's more error prone.
  // rename(&docs, &mydocs).expect("Failed to rename 'docs' directory");
}
```
Please note that the second and third lines are commented out. You can't rename directories across different filesystems using Rust's `rename` function due to security reasons (like it being restricted in some Unix-like systems), but you can use equivalent functions provided by the underlying filesystem (`rename_at`) which may be more reliable if necessary.
