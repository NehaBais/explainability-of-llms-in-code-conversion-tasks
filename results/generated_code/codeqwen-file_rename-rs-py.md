In Python, you can use the `shutil` module which provides various file operations like copying files and directories. Here is how the equivalent code would look:

```python
import shutil
import os

# here
try:
    shutil.move("input.txt", "output.txt")
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(e)
else:
    os.remove("/input.txt")  # remove the original file if moved successfully

try:
    shutil.move("docs", "mydocs")
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(e)
else:
    os.rmdir("/docs")  # delete the original directory if moved successfully

# root
try:
    shutil.move("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(e)

try:
    shutil.move("/docs", "/mydocs")
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(e)
```

Please note that after moving files or directories, Python doesn't have a straightforward way to automatically delete the original files/directories if they were successfully moved. We've added some code to manually remove these files/directories in case of successful move operation.
