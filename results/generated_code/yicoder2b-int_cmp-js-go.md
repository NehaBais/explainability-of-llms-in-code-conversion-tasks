The JavaScript code provided is written in a function `compare()` to get two integers from user input, then it displays a message if the first integer is less than, equal to or greater than the second integer based on the conditions provided.

Here's how this could be converted into GoLang:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func compare(a int, b int) {
    if a == b {
        fmt.Printf("%d is equal to %d\n", a, b)
    } 
    if a < b {
        fmt.Printf("%d is less than %d\n", a, b)
    } 
    if a > b {
        fmt.Printf("%d is greater than %d\n", a, b)
    } 
}
```
In GoLang we do not have to type coercion as in JavaScript unlike `==` which checks if both values are equal and also the variable types must be same but it doesn't check if they could be compared (i.e. integer + string), so it will print that two variables of different types cannot be compared.
Also, GoLang does not have a direct equivalent to JavaScript's `document.writeln()`, so we use the built-in function `fmt.Printf()` instead, which behaves similarly.
