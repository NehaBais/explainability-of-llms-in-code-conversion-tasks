 Here's the equivalent Python code to verify that a file called `input.txt` and a directory called `docs` exist, checking both the current working directory and the filesystem root:

```python
import os

def check_file_or_directory(path):
    if os.path.exists(path):
        if os.path.isdir(path):
            print(f"{path} is a directory")
        else:
            print(f"{path} is a file")
    else:
        print(f"{path} does not exist")

for path in ["input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", "/docs"]:
    check_file_or_directory(path)
```

This Python script uses the `os` module to check if a file or directory exists and whether it is a directory or a file. It iterates over the list of paths provided, performing the same checks as in the Rust code.
