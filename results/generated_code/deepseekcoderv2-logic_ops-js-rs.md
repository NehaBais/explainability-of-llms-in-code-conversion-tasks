The code has been written in JavaScript and needs to be converted to Rust for use in the project. The function will take two boolean values, `a` and `b`, as input and perform logical operations on them using the following rules:
- **AND (&&)**: If both operands are true, then it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
- **OR (||)**: If at least one operand is true, then it returns true; if both operands are false, it returns false.
- **NOT (!)**: If the operand is true, it becomes false and vice versa.
The function should print the results of these operations to the console using `println!` macro from the Rust programming language. The input values will be provided as arguments when calling the function logic(a: bool, b: bool). The code needs to run in a safe manner within the context of the project while maintaining its integrity.
### Code
```
use std::process::exit;
fn logic_and(a: &bool, b: &bool) -> bool {
    if (*a && *b) == true {
        return true
    } else { 
        return false
    }
}
fn logic_or(a: &bool, b: &bool) -> bool {
    if (*a || *b) == true {
        return true
    } else { 
        return false
    }
}
fn main() {
    let a = true;
    let b = false;
    println!("{}", logic_and(&a, &b)); // Output: false
    println!("{}", logic_or(&a, &b)); // Output: true
    println!("{}", !a); // Output: false
}
```
The code is a Rust implementation of the function that takes two boolean values and performs logical operations on them. The program has three parts: 1) `logic_and`, which checks if both input booleans are true; 2) `logic_or`, which checks if at least one input boolean is true; and 3) `main` which sets up the input values for testing and prints out the results using Rust's `println!()` macro.
