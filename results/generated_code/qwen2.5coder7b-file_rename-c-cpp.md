To convert the given C code to C++, you need to use the C++ Standard Library functions instead of the C standard library functions. Here's how you can do it:

1. Use `std::rename` from the `<cstdlib>` header for renaming files.
2. Use `std::filesystem` from the `<filesystem>` header for renaming directories.

Here is the modified code in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <filesystem>

int main() {
    try {
        // Rename files and directories "here" (current working directory)
        std::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
        std::filesystem::rename("docs", "mydocs");

        // Rename files and directories in the filesystem root
        std::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
        std::filesystem::rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **File Renaming with `std::rename`**:
   - The `std::rename` function is used to rename files.
   - It takes two arguments: the old name and the new name.

2. **Directory Renaming with `std::filesystem::rename`**:
   - The `std::filesystem::rename` function is used to rename directories.
   - It also takes two arguments: the old name and the new name.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The code includes a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that might be thrown during the renaming process. This ensures that if an error occurs, it will be caught and printed to the standard error stream.

This C++ code should work similarly to your original C code but with proper C++ syntax and exception handling.
