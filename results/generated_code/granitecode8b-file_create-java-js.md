Here's the JavaScript code that creates an empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory called "docs" in both the current working directory and the filesystem root:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
try {
 // Create a new empty file called "output.txt" in the current working directory
 fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'output.txt'), '');
 
 // Create an empty directory called "docs" in the current working directory
 fs.mkdirSync(path.join(__dirname, 'docs'));
 
 // Get the root directory of the filesystem
 const rootDir = path.parse(process.cwd()).root;
 
 // Create a new empty file called "output.txt" in the filesystem root
 fs.writeFileSync(path.join(rootDir, 'output.txt'), '');
 
 // Create an empty directory called "docs" in the filesystem root
 fs.mkdirSync(path.join(rootDir, 'docs'));
} catch (err) {
 console.error(err);
}
``` 
Note that this code uses Node.js's built-in `fs` module to create files and directories. It also uses the `path` module to handle file paths. The `__dirname` variable is used to get the current working directory, and the `process.cwd()` method is used to get the root directory of the filesystem.
