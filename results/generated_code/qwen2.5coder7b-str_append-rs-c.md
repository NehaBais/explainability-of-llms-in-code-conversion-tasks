In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters. To achieve the string manipulation described in your Rust code, we can use standard library functions like `strcpy` and `strcat`. Here is how you might write this in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char hello[50] = "Hello world"; // Array to store the string
    strcat(hello, "!!!!");          // Append another string literal

    printf("%s\n", hello);           // Show the contents of the variable after the append operation

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **String Representation**: In C, strings are stored as arrays of characters, and they must be null-terminated (`'\0'`). We declare a character array `hello` with an appropriate size (50 in this case) to hold the string "Hello world" along with the additional text.

2. **Appending Strings**: The function `strcat` is used to append one string to another. It takes two arguments: the destination string and the source string. `strcat(hello, "!!!!")` appends "!!!!" to the existing contents of `hello`.

3. **Printing Strings**: The function `printf` is used to print the content of the string. `%s` is a format specifier for strings.

This code will output:

Hello world!!!!
