Here's a Python implementation of the `mkdirp` function:
```python
import os
def mkdirp(path):
 if not os.path.exists(path):
 try:
 os.makedirs(path)
 except OSError as e:
 if e.errno != os.errno.EEXIST:
 raise
```
This implementation uses the `os` module in Python to check if the directory exists and create it if it doesn't. It also handles any errors that may occur during the creation process, such as file permissions or other issues.
