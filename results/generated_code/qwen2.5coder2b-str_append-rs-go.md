To convert the Rust code to Golang, you can use string concatenation using the `+` operator. Below is the equivalent Go code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    hello := "Hello world"
    fmt.Println(hello + "!!!!")
}
```

In Go, strings are immutable, so you cannot directly append to them like in Rust. However, you can use `strings.Join` function for similar purposes:


package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	hello := "Hello world"
	fmt.Println(strings.Join([]string{hello, "!!!!"}, ""))
}


Both of these methods will produce the same output: 


Hello world!!!!
