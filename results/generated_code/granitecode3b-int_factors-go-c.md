Sure! Here's the C code that implements the same logic as the Golang code:
```c
#include 
int main() {
 int64_t nr;
 printf("Enter a positive integer: ");
 scanf("%"SCNd64,&nr);
 
 if(nr < 1) {
 printf("Factors of %" PRId64 " not computedn", nr);
 return 0;
 }
 
 printf("Factors of %" PRId64 ": ", nr);
 int64_t fs[1];
 fs[0] = 1;
 
 for(int i=2, e=0; nr%2==0; i*=2, e++);
 void (*apf)(int64_t, int) = NULL;
 if(e > 0) {
 apf = &printFactor;
 printf("2:");
 printFactor(2, e);
 }
 
 for(int d=3, e=0; d*d <= nr; d+=2) {
 while(nr%d == 0) {
 e++;
 nr /= d;
 }
 if(e > 0) {
 apf = (apf == NULL)? &printFactor : apf;
 printf("%" PRId64 ":", d);
 printFactor(d, e);
 }
 }
 
 if(nr > 1) {
 apf = (apf == NULL)? &printFactor : apf;
 printf("%" PRId64 "", nr);
 }
 
 printf("nnNumber of factors = %dn", e + (int)(fs - fs));
 
 return 0;
}
void printFactor(int64_t p, int e) {
 for(int i=1; i <= e; i++) {
 printf("%" PRId64 "", p);
 }
 printf("n");
}
```
This C code uses a modified version of the trial division method to compute the factors of a positive integer. It first checks if the input is valid (i.e., a positive integer) and prints an error message if it is not. Then, it initializes an array `fs` to store the computed factors and sets `apf` to a null function pointer to indicate that no additional factors have been computed yet.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the prime numbers up to the square root of the input number. For each prime number, it checks if it is a factor by dividing the input number by the prime number and checking if the remainder is 0. If it is a factor, it prints the prime number and updates the `fs` array accordingly.
Finally, the code prints the computed factors and the total number of factors. The `printFactor` function is used to print each factor with its corresponding exponent in the `fs` array.
