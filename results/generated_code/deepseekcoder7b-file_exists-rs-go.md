In Go, we don't have the same level of access to details about a filesystem as in Rust (e.g., without using system-specific APIs). However, you can still verify if files or directories exist by checking for errors when trying to open them. Here is the equivalent Golang code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func checkFile(file string) {
	_, err := os.Stat(file)
	if err == nil {
		fmt.Println(file, "exists")
	} else if os.IsNotExist(err) {
		fmt.Println(file, "does not exist")
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("error occurred while checking %s: %v\n", file, err)
	}
}

func main() {
	for _, file := range []string{"input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", "/docs"} {
		checkFile(file)
	}
}
```

In this Golang code, for each string in the slice we call `os.Stat` function which returns a `*PathError` if file does not exist and it's up to you to handle such cases appropriately. The error is checked with `os.IsNotExist(err)` to see if the error indicates that the file or directory does not exist. If any other error occurs, we print an error message along with the filename and the encountered error.

Please note that "/input.txt" and "/docs" checks will work only on UNIX systems where root is denoted by "/". On Windows it might behave differently as Go's os package doesn't have a direct method to check whether file or directory exists at filesystem root level like Rust's `std::fs` module does. For this, we would need to use some platform-specific way such as in package 'syscall', using raw system calls directly but it is generally not recommended and goes beyond the scope of basic file existence checking.
