Here is the equivalent Java code for your C++ program:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "hello";
        System.out.println(s + " literal");
        String s2 = s.concat(" literal");
        System.out.println(s2);
    }
}
```
In the Java code, we are creating two string variables 's' and 's2' and initializing them with some text values. The value of 's2' is the concatenation of 's' and another string literal. We then print out the content of both variables to illustrate their operation.
