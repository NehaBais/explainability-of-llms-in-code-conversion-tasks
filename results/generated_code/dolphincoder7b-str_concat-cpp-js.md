The JavaScript version of the given C++ code is as follows:

```javascript
let s = "hello";
console.log(s + " literal");
let s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```

This JavaScript script declares two string variables `s` and `s2`. The value of the `s` variable is set to "hello". It then prints out `"hello literal"` using `console.log()`.

The next line concatenates the string variable `s` with the string literal " literal" and assigns the result back to the `s2` variable. Finally, it prints out the value of `s2`, which should be `"hello literal"`.
