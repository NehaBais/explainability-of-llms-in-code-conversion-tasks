Here is the converted code from Java to C++ that achieves the same requirement as the given Java code:
```
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;
bool renameFile(const string& oldname, const string& newname) {
 // File (or directory) with old name
 FILE* file = fopen(oldname.c_str(), "r");
 if (!file) {
 return false;
 }
 fclose(file);
 // File (or directory) with new name
 FILE* file2 = fopen(newname.c_str(), "r");
 if (file2) {
 fclose(file2);
 remove(newname.c_str());
 }
 int result = rename(oldname.c_str(), newname.c_str());
 return (result == 0);
}
void test(const string& type, const string& oldname, const string& newname) {
 cout << "The following " << type << " called " << oldname <<
 (renameFile(oldname, newname) ? " was renamed as " : " could not be renamed into ") <<
 newname << "." << endl;
}
int main() {
 test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
 test("file", "/" + string("input.txt"), "/" + string("output.txt"));
 test("directory", "docs", "mydocs");
 test("directory", "/" + string("docs") + "/", "/" + string("mydocs") + "/");
 return 0;
}
```
Note that the C++ implementation assumes that the user has the rights to create, read, write and execute files in the current working directory. Also, the code uses the `rename` function from the C library to rename a file or directory. This function may not be available on all platforms, so it's important to check its availability before using it.
