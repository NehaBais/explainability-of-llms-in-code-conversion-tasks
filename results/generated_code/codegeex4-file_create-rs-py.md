In Python, you can use the built-in functions `open()`, `os.makedirs()` and `os.path.join()` to create a file and directory. Here is your code converted into Python:

```python
import os

FILE_NAME = "output.txt"
DIR_NAME = "docs"

def main():
    create("./")
    create("/")

def create(root):
    path = os.path.join(root, FILE_NAME)
    with open(path, 'w'):
        pass  # creates an empty file
    
    path = os.path.join(root, DIR_NAME)
    try:
        os.makedirs(path)
    except OSError as e:
        print("Error: %s" % e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this Python code:

- `os.path.join()` function is used to join the root path with the file name or directory name.
- `open(path, 'w')` opens a file for writing. If the file already exists, it truncates (empties) the file; if not, it creates a new file.
- `os.makedirs(path)` creates a directory. If the directory already exists, it raises an error.
- To handle errors when creating a directory, we put the code inside a try-except block.

Please note that in Python, you do not need to explicitly check for success or failure of operations like in Rust as much as you do in Rust using Result type. Instead, Python uses exceptions to deal with error conditions.
