In Python, the equivalent code would be:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value.
s = "hello"
print(s)

# Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal.
s2 = s + ' literal'
print(s2)
```

When running this program, it will output:

hello
helloworld literal
