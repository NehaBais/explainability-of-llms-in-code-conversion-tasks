Here's the converted code from C to Python that verifies the existence of a file called input.txt and a directory called docs, both in the current working directory and in the filesystem root:
```
import os
# Check for regular file in the current working directory
print("input.txt is a regular file? ", end="")
if os.path.isfile("input.txt"):
 print("yes")
else:
 print("no")
# Check for directory in the current working directory
print("docs is a directory? ", end="")
if os.path.isdir("docs"):
 print("yes")
else:
 print("no")
# Check for regular file in the filesystem root
print("/input.txt is a regular file? ", end="")
if os.path.isfile("/input.txt"):
 print("yes")
else:
 print("no")
# Check for directory in the filesystem root
print("/docs is a directory? ", end="")
if os.path.isdir("/docs"):
 print("yes")
else:
 print("no")
```
Note that the `os` module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as checking if a path exists and whether it's a file or directory. The code uses these functions to verify the existence of the files and directories.
