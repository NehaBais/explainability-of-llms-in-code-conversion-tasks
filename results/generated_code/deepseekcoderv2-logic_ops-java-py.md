 Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for the given Java function:

```python
def logic(a, b):
    print("a AND b:", a and b)
    print("a OR b:", a or b)
    print("NOT a:", not a)

# Example usage:
logic(True, False)
```

This Python function `logic` takes two boolean arguments `a` and `b`, and prints the results of "AND", "OR", and "NOT" operations on these arguments.
