Sure, here's the JavaScript code that achieves the same requirements as the Golang code:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
// Rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" and "docs" to "mydocs" in the current working directory
fs.renameSync(path.join('.', 'input.txt'), path.join('.', 'output.txt'));
fs.renameSync(path.join('.', 'docs'), path.join('.', 'mydocs'));
// Rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" and "docs" to "mydocs" in the filesystem root
fs.renameSync('/input.txt', '/output.txt');
fs.renameSync('/docs', '/mydocs');
```
Note that we use the `path` module from Node.js to construct the full paths of the files and directories we want to rename. We also use `require('fs')` to import the file system module from Node.js.
