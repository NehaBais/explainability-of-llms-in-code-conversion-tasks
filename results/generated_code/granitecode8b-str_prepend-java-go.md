Here's the equivalent code in Golang:
```
s := "def"
s = "abc" + s
``` 
In this code, we first declare a variable `s` of type string and assign it the value `"def"`. Then, we concatenate the string literal `"abc"` with the value of `s` using the `+` operator and assign the result back to `s`. The resulting value of `s` will be `"abcdef"`.
