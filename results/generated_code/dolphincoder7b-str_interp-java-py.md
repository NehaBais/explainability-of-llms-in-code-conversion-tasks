Sure, here's how you can convert the given Java code to Python:
```python
adjective = "little"
lyric = f"Mary had a {adjective} lamb."
```
In this example, we use string formatting with f-string to interpolate the value of `adjective` into the string. The `f` in front of the string indicates that it's an f-string (a special type of string where you can embed Python expressions inside it).
