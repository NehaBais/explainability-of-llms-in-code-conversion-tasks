Sure! Below is the equivalent Python code for the given C program:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
s = "hello"

# Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal
s2 = s + " literal"

# To illustrate the operation, show the content of the variables
print(s)
print(s2)

# Since there's no need for dynamic memory allocation in Python,
# we don't have a direct equivalent to the `free` function.
```

This Python code performs the same operations as the given C code:
1. It creates a string variable `s` with the value `"hello"`.
2. It creates another string variable `s2` by concatenating `s` with the string literal `" literal"`.
3. It prints both `s` and `s2`.
4. Python handles memory management automatically, so there is no need to free the memory explicitly.

You can run this code in any standard Python environment.
