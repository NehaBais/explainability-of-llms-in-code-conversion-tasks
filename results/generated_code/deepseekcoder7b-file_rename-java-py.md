The Python code for the given Java program is as follows:

Note that in python os module provides a function called rename() which can be used to rename files and directories.

Python:
```python
import os

def rename_item(oldname, newname): 
    try:
        os.rename(oldname,newname)
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception occurred: ",e)
        return False
        
def test(type, oldname, newname): 
   success = rename_item(oldname, newname)
   if success:
       print("The following " + type + " called " + oldname + 
             " was renamed as " + newname + ".")
   else:
       print("The following " + type + " called " + oldname + 
             " could not be renamed into " + newname + ".")
        
    
def main(): 
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt")
    test("file", "\\"+ "input.txt", "\\"+ "output.txt") # for windows use '\' instead of '/' in path
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs")
    test("directory", "\\" + "docs" + "\\", "\\" + "mydocs" + "\\")  # for windows use '\' instead of '/' in path
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
For windows, you may need to replace '/' with '\'. Please ensure that the Python script has the necessary permissions to rename files and directories. If there are any permission issues, use command prompt to run python script as an administrator.
