Sure, here's the equivalent JavaScript code:
```
const extra = "little";
console.log(`Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`);
```
This code uses template literals to perform string interpolation and replaces the `${extra}` placeholder with the value of the `extra` variable. The result is then printed to the console using `console.log()`.
