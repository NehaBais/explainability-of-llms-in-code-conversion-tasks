The provided code is written in C++ and attempts to accomplish a task by creating an empty file named "output.txt", an empty directory named "docs" at the current working directory, and an empty directory named "docs" at the root of the filesystem. Here's how this would be translated into C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main() {
    // Create output.txt in the current working directory
    FILE *f = fopen("output.txt", "w");
    if (f) 
        fclose(f);

    struct stat buf;
    stat("/output.txt", &buf);
    if (S_ISDIR(buf.st_mode)) { // if it's a directory
        // Create the "/output.txt" directory in the filesystem root 
        int fd = open("/output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
        if (fd >= 0) {
            close(fd);
        } 
    }

    // Create the "docs" directory in the current working directory
    f = fopen("docs", "w");
    if (f) 
        fclose(f);
    
    stat("/docs", &buf); // stat to get its type and mode
    if (S_ISDIR(buf.st_mode)) { // if it's a directory
        // Create the "/docs" directory in filesystem root 
        fd = open("/docs", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
        if (fd >= 0) {
            close(fd);
        } 
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This code does not cover all the corner cases of creating directories as they can fail if the directory already exists, or there's insufficient permissions to create it. Also, "/output.txt" and "/docs" are absolute paths in C and should be replaced with your respective paths based on the system where you are running this program.
