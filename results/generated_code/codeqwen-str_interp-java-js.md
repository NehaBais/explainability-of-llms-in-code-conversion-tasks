In JavaScript, you can use template literals (backticks) and the interpolation syntax to achieve the same thing:

```javascript
let adjective = "little";
let lyric = `Mary had a ${adjective} lamb`;
```

Now if you log 'lyric', it will print "Mary had a little lamb". The string in backticks is a template literal, and the interpolated variable 'adjective' is inserted into this string.
