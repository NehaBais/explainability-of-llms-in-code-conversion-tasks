In Java, you can use the `Files` class to perform file renaming operations. Here's an example of how you could achieve the same thing as the given C++ code in Java:
```
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Rename file "input.txt" to "output.txt" here
        Files.move(Paths.get("input.txt"), Paths.get("output.txt"));
        
        // Rename directory "docs" to "mydocs" here
        Files.move(Paths.get("docs"), Paths.get("mydocs"));
        
        // Rename file "/input.txt" to "/output.txt" in the filesystem root
        Files.move(Paths.get("/input.txt"), Paths.get("/output.txt"));
        
        // Rename directory "/docs" to "/mydocs" in the filesystem root
        Files.move(Paths.get("/docs"), Paths.get("/mydocs"));
    }
}
```
Note that in Java, you need to use the `Files` class to perform file operations, and you also need to specify the path of the files using the `Paths` class. The `rename()` method is used to rename a file or directory, and it takes two arguments: the current name of the file or directory, and the new name that you want to give it.

In this example, we use the `move()` method to rename both the "input.txt" file and the "docs" directory in the current working directory, as well as the "/input.txt" and "/docs" files and directories in the filesystem root. We specify the new names of these files and directories using the `Paths` class, which creates a path object that represents a file or directory. The `move()` method is used to perform the actual renaming operation.
