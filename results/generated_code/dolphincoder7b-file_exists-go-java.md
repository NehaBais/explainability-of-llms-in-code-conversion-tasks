```java
import java.io.File;

class Main {

    public static void printStat(String p)  {
        File file = new File(p);
        if (file.exists()) {
            System.out.println(p + " exists");
            if (file.isDirectory()) 
                System.out.println(p + " is a directory");
            else 
                System.out.println(p + " is not a directory");
        } else 
            System.out.println("File or directory does not exist: " + p);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printStat("input.txt");
        printStat("/input.txt");
        printStat("docs");
        printStat("/docs");
    }
}
```
The converted code is almost the same as the original Golang one, but uses `File` instead of `os`. The main differences are: 
- There is no need for separate variables `i` and `err`, since we can obtain both values in a single line.
- The error handling mechanism changes slightly; it now uses a single `if` statement to catch the exception (as we cannot handle exceptions, they will be thrown as usual). If no exception occurs, the file or directory is considered "exists".
- Instead of using `os.Stat`, `File` provides the same functionality for files and directories.
- The usage of method chaining simplifies the code.
Please note that this solution only checks if a file/directory exists, not whether it has any specific permissions or read access to it.
