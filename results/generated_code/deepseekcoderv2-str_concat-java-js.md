 Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given Java code:

```javascript
let s = "hello";
console.log(s + " literal");
let s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```

This JavaScript code creates a string variable `s` with the value "hello". It then concatenates the string literal " literal" to it and stores the result in another variable `s2`. Finally, it prints both variables to the console.
