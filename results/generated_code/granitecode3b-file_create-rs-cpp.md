Here is the C++ code that accomplishes the same task as the given Rust code:
```c++
#include 
#include 
#include 
#include 
const std::string FILE_NAME = "output.txt";
const std::string DIR_NAME = "docs";
int main() {
 create(".", ".");
 create("/", "/");
 return 0;
}
std::filesystem::create_directory(path);
std::ofstream file(path / filename);
```
The C++ code uses the `std::filesystem` library to create the directory and file. The `create` function takes a path as an argument and creates both the directory and file at that path. The `error_handler` function is not used in this code snippet, but it is included in the original Rust code for completeness.
