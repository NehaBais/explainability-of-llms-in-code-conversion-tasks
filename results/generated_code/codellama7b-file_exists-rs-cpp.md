Here's the C++ code that corresponds to the given Rust code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <filesystem>

int main() {
    std::string current_working_directory = "."; //current working directory is represented by a dot (.)
    std::string input_file_path = "input.txt"; // path to the input file relative to the current working directory
    std::string docs_dir_path = "docs"; // path to the docs directory relative to the current working directory
    std::string root_input_file_path = "/input.txt"; // path to the input file in the filesystem root
    std::string root_docs_dir_path = "/docs"; // path to the docs directory in the filesystem root

    for (auto file : {current_working_directory, input_file_path, docs_dir_path, root_input_file_path, root_docs_dir_path}) {
        try {
            if (std::filesystem::is_directory(file)) {
                std::cout << "Directory: " << file << std::endl;
            } else {
                std::cout << "File: " << file << std::endl;
            }
        } catch (const std::exception& e) {
            std::cerr << "Exception occurred: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        }
    }
}
```
Note that the `std::filesystem` library is used to interact with files and directories in C++17 onward, and the `try-catch` block is used to handle any exceptions that may occur during file system operations.
