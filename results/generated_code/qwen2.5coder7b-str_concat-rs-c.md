Sure! Below is the equivalent code in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    // Create a string variable equal to any text value.
    char* s = "hello";
    printf("%s\n", s);

    // Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal.
    char buffer[100];
    snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "%s world", s);
    printf("%s\n", buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. `char* s = "hello";`: This line declares a pointer to a character array and initializes it with the string literal `"hello"`.
2. `printf("%s\n", s);`: This line prints the content of the `s` variable.
3. `char buffer[100];`: This line declares an array of characters to hold the concatenated result. The size `100` is chosen arbitrarily; it should be large enough to accommodate the original string and the additional text.
4. `snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "%s world", s);`: This line uses `snprintf` to concatenate the strings into the buffer. The first argument is the destination buffer, the second is the size of the buffer, and the third is the format string with placeholders for the variables.
5. `printf("%s\n", buffer);`: This line prints the content of the concatenated buffer.
