This problem can be solved in different programming languages. Here is a solution to the problem in C using the Windows File System API:

Firstly, include the windows.h header file which contains all necessary definitions for the Win32 API. 
```cpp
#include <windows.h>

void Rename(char* from, char* to) {
    MoveFile(from, to); // This function moves or renames a file
}
// Also implement the MoveFolder function for renaming directories

int main() {
   Rename("input.txt", "output.txt"); // You need to add checks for file existence before running this code.
   // Similarly for directory
   return 0;
}
```
This will move your current working file/folder or filesystem root file/directory from its original name 'input.txt'/'docs' to 'output.txt'/'mydocs' respectively, as long as you have write permissions and the files or folders do not already exist in these new names.

Please note: This code only works on Windows systems, as it relies heavily on the Windows API. Also, this code does not handle any exceptions or errors that could occur during the renaming process. For a full-fledged solution, you'd need to add error checking and handling mechanisms.
