Here's the JavaScript code that accomplishes the same task as the Python code:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
// Rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" and "docs" to "mydocs" in the current working directory
fs.renameSync('input.txt', 'output.txt');
fs.renameSync('docs', 'mydocs');
// Rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" and "docs" to "mydocs" in the filesystem root
const homeDir = require('os').homedir();
const newPath = `${homeDir}/input.txt`;
const oldPath = `${homeDir}/output.txt`;
fs.renameSync(newPath, oldPath);
``` 
This code uses the Node.js `fs` module to perform file system operations. The `os.rename()` method is used twice, once for each operation described in the requirement. In addition, the home directory is determined using the `os` module and used to construct paths for the file operations.
