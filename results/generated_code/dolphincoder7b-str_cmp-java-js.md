I have successfully converted the given Java code to JavaScript. Here is the modified JavaScript code:

```javascript
class Compare {
    main() {
        this.compare("Hello", "Hello");
        this.compare("5", "5.0");
        this.compare("java", "Java");
        this.compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ");
        this.compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĵãvá");
    }

    compare(A, B) {
        if (A === B)
            console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are lexically equal.`);
        else
            console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not lexically equal.`);

        if (A.toLowerCase() === B.toLowerCase())
            console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are case-insensitive lexically equal.`);
        else
            console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.`);
        
        if (A < B)
            console.log(`'${A}' is lexically before '${B}'.`);
        else if (A > B)
            console.log(`'${A}' is lexically after '${B}'.`);

        if (!(A < B))
            console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically before '${B}'.`);
        if (!(A > B))
            console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically after '${B}'.`);

        console.log(`The lexical relationship is: ${A.localeCompare(B)}`);
        console.log(`The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: ${A.toLowerCase().localeCompare(B.toLowerCase())}`);
    }
}
```

This JavaScript code demonstrates how to compare two strings for exact equality, inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality), lexical comparison, and achieving both case sensitive comparisons and case insensitive comparisons within the language. It also demonstrates any other kinds of string comparisons that the language provides, particularly as it relates to your type system.
