To convert this code from C++ to JavaScript, you can use the following code:
```
function print_logic(a, b) {
  console.log(`a and b is ${a && b}`);
  console.log(`a or b is ${a || b}`);
  console.log(`not a is ${!a}`);
}
```
Note that in JavaScript, the `console.log()` function is used to print output to the console, while in C++, `std::cout` is used for the same purpose. Additionally, in JavaScript, boolean values are represented as `true` and `false`, whereas in C++, they are represented as `1` and `0`.

Also note that in JavaScript, the use of double quotes (`"`) is preferred for string literals, while in C++, single quotes (`'`) are used.
