Rust doesn't have a direct equivalent of Python's `open()` function for creating files as in the given Python code above. In Rust, to create an empty file you would use the `std::fs::File::create()` method from the standard library or one of its traits (e.g., `Write`).

However, the direct analogue for a directory creation is simply `std::fs::DirBuilder::new()` which creates a new directory at the specified path.

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io::Result;

fn create(directory: &str) -> Result<()> {
    // Creating file "output.txt" in the given directory
    fs::File::create(format!("{}/output.txt", directory))?;
    
    // Creating a new directory named "docs" in the given directory
    fs::DirBuilder::new()?.set_permisions(0o755)?;
    Ok(())
}
  
fn main() -> Result<()> {
  create(".")?; // current directory
  create("/")?; // root directory (not advisable, as it might not work on all systems)
  Ok(())
}
```

Please note that the Python script opens a file in write mode (`"w"`), which truncates an existing file or creates one if it doesn't exist. In Rust, this behavior is provided by `std::fs::File::create()`, but does not include truncation - for writing to files from the beginning, you may have to use `std::fs::OpenOptions` and specify `std::fs::OpenOptions::WRITE` or `std::fs::OpenOptions::APPEND`.

In addition, note that creating a directory in root ("/") will not work universally across all systems due to permission issues; you may want to add error handling for this edge case and print out an appropriate message rather than crashing the program. 

Also please be aware that Rust's file I/O is different from Python's, especially when it comes to handling paths as string literals (`"/"`) or current working directories (`"."`). In Rust, you need to provide a `PathBuf` (path buffer) object to represent the path instead of providing a string. This might require more code and understanding about file system path manipulations in Rust.
