 Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided JavaScript function:

```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    print(f"a AND b: {a & b}")
    print(f"a OR b: {a | b}")
    print(f"a XOR b: {a ^ b}")
    print(f"NOT a: {~a}")
    print(f"a << b: {a << b}")  # left shift
    print(f"a >> b: {a >> b}")  # arithmetic right shift
    print(f"a >>> b: {a >> b}") # logical right shift (Python does not have unsigned right shift, so it's the same as arithmetic)

# Example usage:
bitwise(5, 3)
```

This Python code will perform all the bitwise operations you described on two integers `a` and `b`, with shifts and rotates based on the second integer.
