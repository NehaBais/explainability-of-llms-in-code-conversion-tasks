Sure, here's the JavaScript code that achieves the same task as the C++ code you provided:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
// Rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the current working directory
fs.renameSync('input.txt', 'output.txt');
// Rename "docs" to "mydocs" in the current working directory
fs.renameSync('docs', 'mydocs');
// Rename "/input.txt" to "/output.txt" in the filesystem root
fs.renameSync('/input.txt', '/output.txt');
// Rename "/docs" to "/mydocs" in the filesystem root
fs.renameSync('/docs', '/mydocs');
```
This code uses the Node.js `fs` module to perform the file system operations. The `fs.renameSync()` method is used to rename files and directories synchronously, meaning it blocks until the operation completes. This is appropriate for small-scale tasks like the ones in this example, but may not be suitable for larger or more complex programs.
