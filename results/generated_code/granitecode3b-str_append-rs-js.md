Sure, here's the JavaScript code that performs the same task as the Rust code:
```
let hello = "Hello world";
console.log(hello + "!!!!");
```
The `+` operator is used to concatenate two strings in Javascript. The `console.log()` function is used to print the contents of the variable to the console.
