Sure, here is the equivalent Rust code for your Java code. This translates each function to its corresponding Rust equivalent. Note that in Rust file operations need explicit handling of file creation and deletion.

```rust
use std::fs;

fn rename_file(old_name: &str, new_name: &str) -> bool {
    fs::rename(old_name, new_name).is_ok()
}

fn test(type_: &str, old_name: &str, new_name: &str) {
    println!(
        "The following {} called {}",
        type_,
        old_name,
        if rename_file(old_name, new_name) {
            format!("was renamed as {}", new_name)
        } else {
            String::from("could not be renamed into ")
        }
    );
}

fn main() {
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
    test("file", std::path::Separator::new().to_string().concat(&"input.txt"), std::path::Separator::new().to_string().concat(&"output.txt"));
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs");
    test("directory", std::path::Separator::new().to_string().concat("docs"), std::path::Separator::new().to_string().concat("mydocs"));
}
```

In the Rust code, `fs::rename` is used to rename files and directories. The `if rename_file(old_name, new_name)` checks if the renaming operation was successful and prints an appropriate message. Note that Rust uses paths as strings, so you need to convert them to strings with `.to_string()` when concatenating them.
