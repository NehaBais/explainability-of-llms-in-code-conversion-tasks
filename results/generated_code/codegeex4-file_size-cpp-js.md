The equivalent JavaScript code to the given C++ code would be as follows. Please note that in JavaScript, you should use `fs` and `path` modules for filesystem operations:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function printFileSize(filename) {
    try {
        let stats = fs.statSync(filename);
        console.log(`Size of file ${filename} is ${stats.size} bytes.`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error.message);
    }
}

printFileSize(path.join(__dirname, 'input.txt'));
printFileSize('/input.txt');
```
This script will print the size of `input.txt` in the current working directory and in the root file system. You need to have Node.js installed on your machine to run this code.

You can execute this JavaScript file by running the following command:

node filename.js


Replace 'filename.js' with the actual name of the JavaScript file.
