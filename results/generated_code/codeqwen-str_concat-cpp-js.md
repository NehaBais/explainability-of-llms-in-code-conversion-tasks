Here is the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
var s = 'hello';
console.log(s + ' literal');
var s2 = s + ' literal';
console.log(s2);
```

The first `console.log()` statement logs to the console the contents of `s` followed by the string " literal". The second `console.log()` statement logs to the console the contents of `s2`, which is a concatenation of the contents of `s` and the string " literal".
