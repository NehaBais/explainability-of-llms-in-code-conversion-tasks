 Sure, here is the equivalent code in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string s = "foo";
    s += "bar"; // Append another string literal to the variable s.
    std::cout << s; // Show the contents of the variable after the append operation.
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code initializes a `std::string` with the value "foo" and then appends "bar" to it using the `+=` operator, which is idiomatic in C++. Finally, it prints the contents of the string variable after the append operation.
