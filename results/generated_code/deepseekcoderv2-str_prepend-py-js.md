 Sure, here is the equivalent JavaScript code for the given Python code:

```javascript
let s = "12345678";
s = "0" + s; // by concatenation
console.log(s);
```

This JavaScript code does exactly what your Python code does: it creates a string variable `s` with the value "12345678", prepends the string "0" to it, and then prints the result using `console.log`.
