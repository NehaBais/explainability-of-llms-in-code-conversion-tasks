The equivalent JavaScript code for the given Java code would be:

```javascript
var string = 'abc';
console.log(string);
string += "def";
console.log(string);
```
This script declares a variable `string` and assigns it with value "abc", then logs this to the console. It then appends the string literal "def" to the end of the `string` variable using the assignment operator, and logs the updated value to the console.
