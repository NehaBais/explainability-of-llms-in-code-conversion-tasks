The equivalent code in JavaScript is:

```javascript
var extra = 'little';
var new_str = `Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`;
console.log(new_str);
```

This JavaScript code achieves the same functionality as your Python example. The ${extra} syntax inside the backticks (which are equivalent to \`) in JavaScript is used for string interpolation, just like f-strings in Python.
