The equivalent code in Rust would be:

```rust
fn main() {
    let extra = "little";
    println!("Mary had a {} lamb.", extra);
}
```
This is because the Rust programming language doesn't require explicitly specifying that a string must end with a newline character. The `println!` macro does this for you.
