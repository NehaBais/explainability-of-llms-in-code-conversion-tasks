Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for your requirements:

```python
import os

# Rename files and directories in the current working directory
os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
os.rename("docs", "mydocs")

# Rename files and directories at the filesystem root
root_dir = '/'
os.rename(root_dir + 'input.txt', root_dir + 'output.txt')
os.rename(root_dir + 'docs', root_dir + 'mydocs')
```

This Python script uses the `os` module to rename files and directories. The first set of renames is done in the current working directory, while the second set is done at the filesystem root (`/`).
