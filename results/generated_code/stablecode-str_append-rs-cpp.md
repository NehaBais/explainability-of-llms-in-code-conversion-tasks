Below is the conversion of your Rust code to C++:
C++ equivalent:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string hello = "Hello world";
    hello += "!!!!";
    std::cout << hello << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This C++ code does the same thing as your Rust code: it creates a string variable equal to any text value, appends this string literal in an idiomatic way (using '+' operator for strings), and finally prints out the contents of the variable after the append operation.
