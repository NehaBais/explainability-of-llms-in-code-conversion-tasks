The equivalent JavaScript code for the given C program is as follows:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" and "docs" to "mydocs" in current working directory
fs.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt', (err) => {
  if(err){ throw err; }
});
fs.rename('docs', 'mydocs', (err) => {
  if(err){ throw err; }
});

// Rename "/input.txt" to "/output.txt" and "/docs" to "/mydocs" in filesystem root
try{
    fs.rename('/input.txt', '/output.txt');
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
try{
    fs.rename('/docs', '/mydocs');
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```
Please note that the `fs` module is Node.js's file system module and it's used in the JavaScript programs. `fs.rename()` function is used to rename a file or directory. If an error occurs, it gets thrown by `fs.rename()` and caught and handled accordingly.
