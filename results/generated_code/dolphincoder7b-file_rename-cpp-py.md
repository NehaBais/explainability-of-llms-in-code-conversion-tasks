Sure, here's the Python code that performs the required task:

```python
import os
import shutil

# This will rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the current working directory
os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt')

# And this will rename "docs" to "mydocs" in the current working directory
shutil.move('docs', 'mydocs')

# This will rename "/input.txt" to "/output.txt", assuming you are running this script from the filesystem root
os.rename('/input.txt', '/output.txt')

# And this will rename "/docs" to "/mydocs", assuming you are running this script from the filesystem root
shutil.move('/docs', '/mydocs')
```

Please note that the Python's built-in `os` module is used to carry out most of the tasks and `shutil` provides an additional method for moving a directory. 

Keep in mind that these operations might require administrative rights depending on your setup. In some cases, you might need to run the script as an administrator to execute those commands successfully. If you're unsure about this, consult your operating system's documentation or ask for help from someone who has more knowledge about the specifics of your system.
