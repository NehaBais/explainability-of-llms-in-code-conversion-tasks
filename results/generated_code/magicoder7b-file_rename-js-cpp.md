 The JavaScript code provided uses the ActiveXObject from Windows Script Host (WSH), which is a Microsoft script host for Windows platform and cannot be used in C++ standard environment. 

C++ doesn't have a built-in way to interact with filesystem like JavaScript does, we will use POSIX system calls instead. Here is the equivalent code in C++:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>  // for rename() function

int main() {
    std::cout << "Renaming files and directories..." << std::endl;
    
    // in the current working directory
    if(rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0) {
        perror("Cannot rename input file");
        return -1;  
    } else {
        std::cout << "Input file successfully renamed to output.txt." << std::endl;
    }
    
    // in the root directory
    if(rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt") != 0) {
        perror("Cannot rename input file in root directory");
        return -1;  
    } else {
        std::cout << "Input file in root directory successfully renamed to output.txt." << std::endl;
    }
    
    // renaming directory here
    if(rename("docs", "mydocs") != 0) {
        perror("Cannot rename docs directory");
        return -1;  
    } else {
        std::cout << "Docs directory successfully renamed to mydocs." << std::endl;
    }
    
    // renaming directory in root
    if(rename("/docs", "/mydocs") != 0) {
        perror("Cannot rename docs directory in root");
        return -1;  
    } else {
        std::cout << "Docs directory in root successfully renamed to mydocs." << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code will attempt to rename files or directories. If a rename operation fails, it will print the error message using perror(). Please note that this C++ code should be run in an environment where it has appropriate permissions (i.e., "input.txt" and "/input.txt", as well as "docs" and "/docs" must exist) to perform these operations.
