Sure, here is the equivalent code in Python:

```python
class Str():
    def main(self):
        # create string variable s and print its content
        s = "hello"
        print(s + " literal") 
        
        # concatenate s with " literal" and assign it to s2
        s2 = s + " literal"
        
        # print the content of s2
        print(s2) 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Str().main()
```
