 Certainly! Below is the equivalent code in Golang that performs the same operations as the provided Java code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	str := "abc"
	fmt.Println(str)
	str += "def"
	fmt.Println(str)
}
```

In this Go code:
- We declare a string variable `str` and initialize it with the value `"abc"`.
- We print the contents of the string before and after appending `"def"` to it using the `fmt.Println` function.
