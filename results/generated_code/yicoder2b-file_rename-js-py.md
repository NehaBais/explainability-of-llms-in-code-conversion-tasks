Sure, the equivalent Python code would be:

```python
import os

# Move file from here to output.txt 
os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt')

# Move file in cwd to output.txt
os.rename('docs', 'mydocs')

# Move folder from filesystem root to mydocs in root
os.rename('/docs', '/mydocs')
```
Please note that the above python code will work only if you are in the root directory and have write permissions for the new file/folder names.
