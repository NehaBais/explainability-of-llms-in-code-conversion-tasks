Sure! Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for your requirements:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
// Verify file size in current working directory
const cwdSize = fs.statSync('input.txt').size;
console.log(cwdSize);
// Verify file size in root directory
const rootSize = fs.statSync('/input.txt').size;
console.log(rootSize);
```
Note that the `fs` module is imported at the top of the code, and the `statSync()` method is used to retrieve the file size in bytes. The `cwd` and `/` are just strings representing the current working directory and root directory, respectively. 
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
