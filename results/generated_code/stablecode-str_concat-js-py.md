In Python, you don't need to declare a type for your variable like 'var' in JavaScript. Here is how you would write the equivalent code in Python:

```python
s = "hello"
print(s + " there!"))
```
This Python code performs the exact same operation as the given JavaScript code. It creates a string variable named 's' and assigns it the value of 'hello'. Then, it concatenates 'there!' to the end of the 's' variable's current value, then prints the result.
