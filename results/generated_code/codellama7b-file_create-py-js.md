To convert the Python code to JavaScript, you can use the `fs` module in Node.js to create files and directories. Here is an example of how you can modify the Python code to create a new empty file called "output.txt" and an empty directory called "docs" twice, once in the current working directory and once in the filesystem root:
```
const fs = require('fs');

function create(directory) {
  const outputFile = path.join(directory, 'output.txt');
  const docsDir = path.join(directory, 'docs');

  // Create a new empty file called "output.txt"
  fs.openSync(outputFile, 'w');

  // Create an empty directory called "docs"
  fs.mkdirSync(docsDir);
}

create('.'); // current directory
create('/'); // root directory
```
Note that the `fs` module is a synchronous API, so you may want to consider using the asynchronous version of these functions if you need to perform other tasks while creating the files and directories. Additionally, be aware that Node.js runs in a single-threaded environment, so you should avoid blocking the main thread for too long when performing I/O operations.
