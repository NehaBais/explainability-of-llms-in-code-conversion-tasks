In Python, the equivalent code to Rust would be:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value.
hello = "Hello world"

# Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way.
hello += "!!!!"

# Show the contents of the variable after the append operation.
print(hello)
```

This Python code creates a string variable `hello` and assigns it the value "Hello world". It then appends the string literal "!!!!" to the `hello` variable using the `+=` operator. Finally, it prints the contents of the `hello` variable after the append operation.
