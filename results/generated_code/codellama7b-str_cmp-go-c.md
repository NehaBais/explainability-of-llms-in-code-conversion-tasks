This code demonstrates several string comparison operators in Go, including:

* Exact equality (`==`) and inequality (`!=`) of two strings using the `==` and `!=` operators.
* Lexical ordering of two strings using the `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` operators.
* Case-sensitive and case-insensitive comparison of two strings using the `strings.EqualFold()` function from the Go standard library's `strings` package.

Here is the C code equivalent of this Go code:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char c[] = "cat";
    char d[] = "dog";

    if (strcmp(c, d) == 0) {
        printf("%s is bytewise identical to %s\n", c, d);
    } else {
        printf("%s is bytewise different from %s\n", c, d);
    }

    if (strcmp(c, d) < 0) {
        printf("%s is lexically bytewise greater than %s\n", c, d);
    } else if (strcmp(c, d) > 0) {
        printf("%s is lexically bytewise less than %s\n", c, d);
    } else if (strcmp(c, d) == 0) {
        printf("%s is lexically bytewise greater than or equal to %s\n", c, d);
    } else {
        printf("%s is lexically bytewise less than or equal to %s\n", c, d);
    }

    // Case-insensitive comparison of two strings using the `strcasecmp()` function from the `strings` library.
    if (strcasecmp(c, d) == 0) {
        printf("%s is case-insensitively equal to %s\n", c, d);
    } else {
        printf("%s is not case-insensitively equal to %s\n", c, d);
    }

    // Seeing that the built-in operators work bytewise and the library case-folding functions interpret UTF-8, you might then ask about other equality and inequality tests that interpret UTF-8.
    return 0;
}
```
Note that the `strcasecmp()` function is not part of the C standard library, but it is provided by the `strings` library in the Go "sub repository" at `golang.org/x/text`. This library provides support for Unicode normalization, collation tables, and locale-sensitive comparisons.

Also note that the `strcasecmp()` function is not available in C++, so if you are writing code in a C++ compiler, you will need to use a different function or write your own implementation of case-insensitive string comparison.
