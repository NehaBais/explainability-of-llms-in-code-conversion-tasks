To convert this JavaScript code to C, you can use the System.IO.Directory and System.IO.File classes. Here is how you can do it:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Define paths for input.txt and docs in the current directory
        string currentDirectoryInputPath = "input.txt";
        string currentDirectoryDocsPath = "docs";

        // Define path for input.txt and docs in the root directory
        string rootDirectoryInputPath = "/path/to/root/input.txt";
        string rootDirectoryDocsPath = "/path/to/root/docs";

        // Check if files exist in the current directory
        Console.WriteLine("Checking if " + currentDirectoryInputPath + " exists: " + File.Exists(currentDirectoryInputPath));
        Console.WriteLine("Checking if " + currentDirectoryDocsPath + " exists: " + Directory.Exists(currentDirectoryDocsPath));

        // Check if directories exist in the current directory
        Console.WriteLine("Checking if " + rootDirectoryDocsPath + " exists: " + Directory.Exists(rootDirectoryDocsPath));

        // Additional check to ensure paths are correct (not necessary if they are given correctly)
    }
}
```

Please note that the path for the root directory must be replaced with the actual path on your system. Also, this code assumes that the paths are relative to the current executing file's directory.

This C program does exactly the same thing as the JavaScript code. It checks if files and directories exist at the specified paths in both the current working directory and the root directory.
