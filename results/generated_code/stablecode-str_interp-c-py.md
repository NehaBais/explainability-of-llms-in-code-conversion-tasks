Here is the Python equivalent of your C code:

```python
def main(): 
    extra = "little"
    print(f"Mary had a {extra} lamb.")

main()
```

In this Python program, we are using an f-string to interpolate the `extra` variable into the print statement. This is equivalent to the use of printf in your C code.
