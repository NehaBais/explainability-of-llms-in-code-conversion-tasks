Sure! Here's the converted code in Python:
```python
import os

def main():
    err = "File move error"
    
    # Rename input.txt to output.txt in current working directory
    try:
        os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
    except OSError as e:
        print(err)
        
    # Rename docs to mydocs in current working directory
    try:
        os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
    except OSError as e:
        print(err)
        
    # Rename input.txt to output.txt in filesystem root
    try:
        os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
    except OSError as e:
        print(err)
        
    # Rename docs to mydocs in filesystem root
    try:
        os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
    except OSError as e:
        print(err)
```
Note that in Python, we use the `os` module to perform file operations, and we don't need to explicitly check for errors using `ok()` or `expect()`. The `os.rename()` function will raise an `OSError` if there is an error during the renaming process.
