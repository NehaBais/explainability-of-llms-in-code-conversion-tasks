 In Go, the most idiomatic way to append a string is not by using the `+=` operator as in Java but by appending to the existing string through its built-in methods like `+=`. Here's how you can do it:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
    var str = "abc"
    fmt.Println(str)
    
    str += "def"
    fmt.Println(str)
}
```

In the above code, we first declare a variable `str` and assign it the value `"abc"`. Then, we print its current value by using `fmt.Println()`. Next, we append `"def"` to `str` using the `+=` operator (or `str += "def"` in Go). Finally, we print the updated value of `str`.
