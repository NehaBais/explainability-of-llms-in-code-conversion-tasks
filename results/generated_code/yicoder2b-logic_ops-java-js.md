The equivalent JavaScript code for the given Java function is as follows:
```javascript
function logic(a,b){
    console.log("a AND b: " + (a && b));
    console.log("a OR b: " + (a || b));
    console.log("NOT a: " + !a);
}
```
You can call the function with two boolean values, e.g. `logic(true, false)` will print out the logical operations and their results on true and false.
