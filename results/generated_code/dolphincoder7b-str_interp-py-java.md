This is a Python code snippet. To convert it to Java, we first need to understand the syntax and semantics differences between the two languages, as well as the specific details of the string interpolation in both languages.
Here's how you can translate this into Java:
```java
String extra = "little";
String newStr = String.format("Mary had a %s lamb.", extra);
System.out.println(newStr);
```
In Java, we use `String.format()` to perform string interpolation. It works similarly to Python's f-string formatting. However, note that in Java, the `%` character is used for string interpolation, while in Python, it stands for variable substitution. Also, `System.out.println()` is used to output the result.
Please note that this translation is very basic and will not work directly without modifications or additional dependencies. It just provides a template that you can use as a starting point. The specific code needed for string interpolation and usage of `String.format()` in Java may vary based on your requirements and codebase.
