Below is the Python equivalent of your Rust code. This Python code does essentially the same thing as your Rust code. It creates a file "output.txt" and a directory "docs". 

This code will be executed in a Python environment, not directly converted into an executable form like a compiled binary or an exe file.

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

const_file_name = "output.txt"
const_dir_name = "docs"


def create(root):
    try:
        f_path = os.path.join(root, const_file_name))
        d_path = os.path.join(root, const_dir_name))

        os.mkdir(d_path)
        with open(f_path, 'w')) as file:
            pass
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")


def error_handler(error, code):
    try:
        import sys
        sys.stderr.write(f"Error: {error}\n")
        exit(code)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error handling error: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    create(".")
    create("/")
```
You can run this Python script in your preferred Python environment. It will create the desired file and directory in your current working directory and root filesystem folder.
