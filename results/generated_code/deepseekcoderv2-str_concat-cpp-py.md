 Sure! Here's the equivalent Python code for the given C++ code:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value.
s = "hello"

# Concatenate the original variable with another string literal.
s2 = s + " literal"

# Show the content of the variables.
print(s)
print(s2)
```

This Python code performs the same operations as the C++ code: it initializes a string variable `s` with the value "hello", concatenates " literal" to it, and then prints both strings.
