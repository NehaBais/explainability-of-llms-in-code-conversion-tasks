The Java equivalent for the JavaScript code is as follows:

```java
// Using type coercion
public static void compare (int a, int b){
    if(a == b)
        System.out.println(a + " equals " + b);
    if(a < b) 
        System.out.println(a + " is less than " + b); 
    if(a > b) 
        System.out.println(a + " is greater than " + b); 
}
```
