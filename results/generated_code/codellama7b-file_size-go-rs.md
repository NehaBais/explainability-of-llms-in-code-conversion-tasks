This code converts the input file size of a given file name. The import statements are used to use the os.Stat function and fmt module. In Rust, these imports are written as follows:
```rust
use std::fs;
use std::fmt;

fn main() {
    // Prints the size of the input.txt file in the current working directory
    println!("Size of input.txt: {}", fs::metadata("input.txt").len());
    
    // Prints the size of the /input.txt file located in root folder
    println!("Size of /input.txt: {}", fs::metadata("/input.txt").len());
}
```
The code below converts the input file size of a given file name, with the requirement that the program checks for the existence and type of the file. If either of these requirements is met, it will print the size of the file in bytes.
