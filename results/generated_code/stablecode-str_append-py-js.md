Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your Python requirement. 

```javascript
// Create a string variable equal to any text value.
let str = "123 456 78";

// Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way.
str += "9!";

// Show the contents of the variable after the append operation.
console.log(str);
```
This JavaScript code does exactly what your Python code does: it creates a string, appends another string to it and then prints out the final value of the string.
