The equivalent code in Golang would be:

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	str := "my String"
	newStr := "Changed " + str 
	fmt.Println(newStr)
}
```
In the Golang version of the code, we're using the `strings` package to concatenate two strings together and the `fmt` package to print the result to the console.
