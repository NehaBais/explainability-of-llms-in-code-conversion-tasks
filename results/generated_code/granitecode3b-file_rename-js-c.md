Here is the C code that performs the same task as the JavaScript code provided:
```c
#include 
int main() {
 _ @_;
 system("move input.txt output.txt");
 system("move c:\\input.txt c:\\output.txt");
 system("move docs mydocs");
 system("move c:\\docs c:\\mydocs");
 return 0;
}
```
This code uses the `system()` function to execute shell commands that move files and directories. The first two calls to `system()` move the "input.txt" file to the "output.txt" file in the current working directory, and the same for the "c:/input.txt" file in the filesystem root. The next two calls move the "docs" directory to the "mydocs" directory in the current working directory, and the same for the "c:/docs" directory in the filesystem root.
