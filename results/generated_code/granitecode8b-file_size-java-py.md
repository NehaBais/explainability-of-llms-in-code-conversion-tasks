Here's the Python code that verifies the size of a file called input.txt for a file in the current working directory and another one in the file system root:
```
import os
file_path = "input.txt"
# For a file in the current working directory
file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
print("%,d B" % (file_size))
# For a file in the file system root
file_system_root = "/"
file_path = os.path.join(file_system_root, "input.txt")
file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
print("%,d B" % (file_size))
``` 
The `os.path.getsize()` function is used to get the size of a file in bytes. The `os.path.join()` method is used to concatenate the file system root path and the file name to create an absolute file path.
