Below is the equivalent C code for the given Java code to rename files and directories:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    printf("The following file called input.txt %s renamed as output.txt\n", 
           rename("input.txt", "output.txt") == 0 ? "was" : "could not be");

    printf("The following file called /input.txt %s renamed as /output.txt\n", 
           rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt") == 0 ? "was" : "could not be");
    
    printf("The following directory called docs %s renamed as mydocs\n", 
           rename("docs", "mydocs") == 0 ? "was" : "could not be");
            
    printf("The following directory called /docs %s renamed as /mydocs\n", 
           rename("/docs/", "/mydocs/") == 0 ? "was" : "could not be");
   
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the C standard library doesn't provide a direct way to rename directories. For this reason, the above code only works for files. To perform directory renaming in C you need to implement it yourself using system calls or use a third-party library like `libc_utils` which provides functions such as `rename_dir()` that can be used to perform operations like these.
