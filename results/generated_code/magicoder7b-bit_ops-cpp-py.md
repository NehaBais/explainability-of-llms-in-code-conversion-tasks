 In Python, you can use the bitwise operators `&`, `|`, `^`, and `~` to perform the same operations as in C++. The shift (`<<`, `>>`) and rotate (using the `rotate()` function from the `itertools` module) operations are implemented in a similar way but there is no direct equivalent for right arithmetic shift (`>>>`). For rotations, you can use Python's built-in zip function with slicing to achieve this. Here is how the code might look:

```python
from itertools import cycle

def bitwise(a, b):
    print("a and b: ", a & b)
    print("a or b:  ", a | b)
    print("a xor b: ", a ^ b)
    print("not a:   ", ~a)
    
    # bitwise shift operation is same in python as c++.
    print(f"a shl {b}: ", a << b) 
    if (b < 0 or b >= 32):
        print('Warning: the shift count should be positive and less than 32')
    else:
        print("a shr b: ", a >> b)  
        
    # convert to unsigned int for logical right shift operation.
    ua = a & 0xffffffff 
    
    if (b < 0 or b >= 32):
        print('Warning: the rotation count should be positive and less than 32')
    else:  
        # Use zip function with slicing to achieve rotation operation.
        # In Python, a rotation operation is essentially equivalent to repeated concatenation of the number.
        # We take advantage of this property by zipping together our number with itself, then taking every b-th element.
        print(f"a lsr {b}: ", ''.join([str(int(bit)) for bit in list(zip(*cycle(str(ua))))[b::len(str(ua))]]) )  
```
