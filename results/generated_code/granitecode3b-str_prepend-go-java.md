Here's the equivalent Java code:
```
String s = "Hello, world!";
```
In Java, you don't need to declare a variable type like in Golang. The data type is automatically inferred based on the assigned value. Additionally, in Java, concatenation is done using the `+` operator, which is different from Golang's string interpolation.
