Here is the equivalent Python code using os module:

Python Code :
```python
import os
# Rename in current directory
os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt')
os.rename('docs', 'mydocs')

# Changing to root directory / (for windows it's C:\)
# then renaming 
old_path = os.getcwd()
os.chdir('/')
try:
    os.renames('input.txt', 'output.txt')
    os.renames('docs', 'mydocs')
finally:
    os.chdir(old_path)  
```
Please note that this Python code is operating system dependent and won't work in non-Unix/Linux systems such as Windows, or if the current working directory does not contain input.txt and docs subdirectories. 

Moreover, when using os.renames() for a file to a different disk (like 'c:/'), it requires special permissions that might be not available depending on your OS settings and running user privileges.

Also note the second os.chdir('/') command will change directory to root(/). This is useful in Unix/Linux systems but if you are using Windows, you would need to provide the actual path of the drive where these directories reside (like 'C:/'), as `os.chdir('C:')` for example.
