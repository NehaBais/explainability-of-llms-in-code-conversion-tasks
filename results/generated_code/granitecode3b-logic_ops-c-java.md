Sure! Here's the equivalent Java code for the given C function:
```java
public class LogicCalculator {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 int a = 1;
 int b = 0;
 
 System.out.println("a and b is " + (a && b));
 System.out.println("a or b is " + (a || b));
 System.out.println("not a is " + (!a));
 }
}
```
In this Java code, we declare two integer variables `a` and `b`, initialize them with the values 1 and 0 respectively, and then use the logical operators `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT) to compute the results of "and", "or", and "not" on the arguments `a` and `b`. Finally, we print the results using `System.out.println()`.
