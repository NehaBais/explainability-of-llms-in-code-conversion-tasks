The equivalent code in C++ can be written using the Windows API. It requires administrator privileges to move files and directories, so it is likely that the code will need to run with elevated permissions.

Here's how you could write this code:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <string>

void moveFile(std::wstring sourcePath, std::wstring destinationPath) {
    MoveFileEx(sourcePath.c_str(), 0, destinationPath.c_str(), MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING | MOVEFILE_COPY_HARDLINK);
}

void moveDirectory(std::wstring sourcePath, std::wstring destinationPath) {
    SHCreateDirectory(destinationPath.c_str(), NULL);
    SHFileOperation(NULL, FO_MOVE, sourcePath.c_str(), destinationPath.c_str(), 0, FOF_NOCONFIRMATION, NULL, NULL);
}

int main() {
    // Move files in the current working directory
    moveFile(L"input.txt", L"output.txt");
    moveFile(L"c:/input.txt", L"c:/output.txt");

    // Move folders in the current working directory
    moveDirectory(L"docs", L"mydocs");
    moveDirectory(L"c:/docs", L"c:/mydocs");

    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the use of `SHCreateDirectory` and `SHFileOperation` requires linking with the Shell32 library. This is typically done by adding `-lShell32` to your compiler command.

Also, remember to run this program as an administrator for it to have the necessary permissions to move files and folders in the filesystem root.

Lastly, the use of wide strings (`std::wstring`) is suggested because Windows APIs use Unicode strings.
