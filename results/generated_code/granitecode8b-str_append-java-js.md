Here's the equivalent JavaScript code that meets the requirements:
```javascript
let string = "abc";
console.log(string);
string += "def";
console.log(string);
```
This code creates a variable called `string` and assigns it the value `"abc"`. Then, it appends the string literal `"def"` to the end of the `string` variable using the `+=` operator, which is equivalent to `string = string + "def"`. Finally, it logs the contents of the `string` variable to the console using `console.log()`.
