 The equivalent code in Python would be:

```python
import os

def rename_files():
    try:
        # here
        os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
        os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
        
        # root
        with os.popen('cd /') as w:  # change directory to the root
            os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
            os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
    except PermissionError:  # user does not have permission to rename files/directories
        print("Permission denied!")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    rename_files()
```

This code does the same as the C++ one. It first renames the file called `input.txt` in the current working directory to `output.txt`, and similarly for the directory called `docs`. Then, it attempts to do the same but in the root filesystem directory (note that `cd /` changes the current directory to the root). If it encounters a permission error, it stops and prints an error message.
