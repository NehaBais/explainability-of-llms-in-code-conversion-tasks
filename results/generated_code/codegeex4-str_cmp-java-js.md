```javascript

    if (A === B)
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are lexically equal.`);
    else
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not lexically equal.`);

    if (A.toLowerCase() === B.toLowerCase())
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are case-insensitive lexically equal.`);
    else
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.`);

    if (A < B)
        console.log(`'${A}' is lexically before '${B}'.`);
    else if (A > B)
        console.log(`'${A}' is lexically after '${B}'.`);

    if (!(A < B))
        console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically before '${B}'.`);
    if (!(A > B))
        console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically after '${B}'.`);

    console.log(`The lexical relationship is: ${A.localeCompare(B)}`);
    console.log(`The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: ${A.localeCompare(B, undefined, {sensitivity: 'base'})}`);

Some differences to note:
- JavaScript uses `===` for exact equality and `!==` for inequality, while Java uses `.equals()` method.
- JavaScript handles case-insensitive comparisons using the `.toLowerCase()` or `.toUpperCase()` methods.
- JavaScript compares two strings lexicographically with `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`. 
- The `localeCompare()` method in JavaScript is used for comparing two strings in a language-sensitive manner, similar to Java's `compareTo()`.
- JavaScript does not provide an equivalent function for case-insensitive comparison as in Java (i.e., without transforming the string), so the solution is implemented by converting both strings to lowercase.
- In Java, numeric strings are compared lexicographically, while in JavaScript, they are compared numerically if possible. If they cannot be converted into a number, they're treated as strings and compared lexicographically.
