Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Java code:

```javascript
let s = "hello";
console.log(s + " literal");
let s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```

JavaScript uses `let` instead of `String`. The `System.out.println()` in Java is equivalent to the `console.log()` in JavaScript for outputting text to the console.
