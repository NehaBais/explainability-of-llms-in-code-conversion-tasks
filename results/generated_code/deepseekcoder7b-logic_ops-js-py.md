Here is the equivalent Python code for your JavaScript function. It performs the same operations, but uses the standard Python boolean operators and built-in `print()` function in Python instead of JavaScript's `print()` statement:

```python
def logic(a, b):
  print("a AND b: " + str(a and b))
  print("a OR b: " + str(a or b))
  print("NOT a: " + str(not a))
```
