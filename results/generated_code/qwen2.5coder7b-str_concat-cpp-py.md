Here is the equivalent Python code for your C++ code:

```python
s = "hello"
print(s + " literal")
s2 = s + " literal"
print(s2)
```

In this Python code, we create a string variable `s` equal to `"hello"`, and then print it followed by the string literal `" literal"`. We then concatenate `s` with `" literal"` and store the result in another string variable `s2`, which is printed out.
