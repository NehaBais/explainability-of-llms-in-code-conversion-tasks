Sure, here's the equivalent Python code for your requirements. The code includes detailed comments explaining each operation.

```python
import sys
from math import pow

def main():
    # get two integers from command line arguments
    a = int(sys.argv[1]))
    b = int(sys.argv[2]))

    print("sum: ", a + b)
    print("difference: ", a - b)
    print("product: ", a * b)
    print("integer quotient (towards zero): ", a // b)  # floor division, rounds towards negative infinity
    print("remainder: ", a % b)  # modulus operation, sign of remainder matches the sign of first operand
    print("exponentiation: ", pow(a, b)))  # pow function from math module for exponentiation

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
Please note that Python treats // as floor division (always rounds towards negative infinity), and a single or double quote string in python is considered as a raw string(backslashes are treated as literal characters) which results in different output comparison with the Rust code.
