In Go, the standard library does not provide a direct way to rename files or directories in the file system (like Python's `os.rename`), but you can use the `os.Rename()` function from the os package which provides the same functionality. 
Here is how it will look like:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func renameFileOrDir(oldPath, newPath string) {
	err := os.Rename(oldPath, newPath)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error: ", err)
	}
}

func main()  {
	renameFileOrDir("input.txt", "output.txt")
	renameFileOrDir("docs", "mydocs")
	renameFileOrDir("/input.txt", "/output.txt")   //It is not recommended to do so as it may cause problems on some systems
	renameFileOrDir("/docs", "/mydocs")             //Also, this will only work if /docs and /mydocs are root directories in the file system
}
``` 
Please note that renaming files or directories at filesystem roots ("/input.txt" etc.) is generally not advisable as it may cause problems with the file system structure on some systems, especially ones like Linux where "/" represents the root of the entire filesystem. It's better to rename them in their respective working directory and then move those files/directories into other directories if required.
