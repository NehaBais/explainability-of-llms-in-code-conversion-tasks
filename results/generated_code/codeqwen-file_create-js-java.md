The equivalent code in Java would be:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        createFile("./output.txt");
        createFile("/output.txt");

        createDirectory("./docs");
        createDirectory("/docs");
    }

    private static void createFile(String path) throws IOException {
        Path file = Paths.get(path);
        Files.createFile(file, FileAttribute<?>[] {});
    }

    private static void createDirectory(String path) throws IOException {
        Path dir = Paths.get(path);
        Files.createDirectory(dir, FileAttribute<?>[] {});
    }
}
```
This Java code does the following:

- Creates a `createFile()` function that takes in a string parameter representing the file path and creates an empty file at that location.
- It then calls this function twice, passing in paths for files located relative to the current working directory (the first call) and paths for files located from the root of the filesystem (the second call).

- Similarly, it creates a `createDirectory()` function that takes in a string parameter representing the directory path and creates an empty directory at that location.
- It then calls this function twice, passing in paths for directories located relative to the current working directory (the first call) and paths for directories located from the root of the filesystem (the second call). 

Please note that Java does not have built-in support to create a file or a directory if it doesn't exist. If you need this functionality, you may want to use a try-catch block around the `createFile()` and `createDirectory()` calls to handle potential `NoSuchFileException` exceptions.
