In JavaScript, you can use the `fs` module to rename files and directories. Here's an example of how you could modify your code to do so:
```
const fs = require('fs');

function main() {
    const err = "File move error";
    try {
        fs.renameSync('input.txt', 'output.txt');
        fs.renameSync('docs', 'mydocs');
        fs.renameSync('/input.txt', '/output.txt');
        fs.renameSync('/docs', '/mydocs');
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
}
```
Note that in JavaScript, you need to use the `fs` module and the `renameSync()` method to perform a synchronous file rename operation. The `try...catch` block is used to handle any potential errors that may occur during the file renaming process.
