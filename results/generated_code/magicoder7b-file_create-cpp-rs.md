 Rust has a different approach to file and directory handling compared with C++, so the code will be quite different when translated from C++ into Rust. Here is your C++ code converted into Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Create an empty file called "output.txt" in the current directory and root.
    fs::File::create("output.txt").expect("Failed to create output file");
    let _ = fs::File::create("/output.txt");
    
    // Create an empty directory called "docs" in the current directory and root.
    fs::create_dir("docs").expect("Failed to create docs directory");
    let _ = fs::create_dir("/docs");
}
```

In Rust, you'll need to handle errors explicitly because there is no exceptions mechanism like C++. Therefore, the `expect` method will be called whenever an operation could potentially fail and panic if an error occurs. The `_` before `let _ = fs::...` indicates that we don't care about the result of creating the file/directory on the root level - it is just a waste of resources as such operations are not idempotent in Rust.
