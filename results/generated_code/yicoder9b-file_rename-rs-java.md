Here is the equivalent Java code for your Rust program:

```Java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class Main {
    private static final String ERROR_MESSAGE = "File move error";
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Rename file in the current working directory
            renameFile("input.txt", "output.txt");
  
            // Rename a directory in the current working directory
            renameFile("docs", "mydocs");
  
            // Rename file at filesystem root 
            Path path1 = Paths.get("/"+"input.txt");
            Path path2 = Paths.get("/"+"output.txt");
            Files.move(path1, path2);
  
            // Rename a directory at filesystem root
            path1 = Paths.get("/"+"docs");
            path2 = Paths.get("/"+"mydocs");
            Files.move(path1, path2);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
  
    private static void renameFile(String oldName, String newName) throws IOException {
        Path path = Paths.get(oldName);
        Files.move(path, path.resolveSibling(newName)); 
    }
}
```
In Java you don't have the same functionality as Rust to rename a file or directory directly in the filesystem root like you can do with the `fs::rename` function in Rust. Therefore, we use `Paths.get("/"+oldName)` for file and directory paths at the filesystem root.

In the `main()` method, please replace `/input.txt`, `/output.txt`, etc with your own file or directory names to be renamed. 

This Java code does exactly what you asked in Rust: it renames a file called input.txt into output.txt and a directory called docs into mydocs both "here" (in the current working directory) and at filesystem root level. If something goes wrong, an exception is thrown with a custom error message of "File move error".
