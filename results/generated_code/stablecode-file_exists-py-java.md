Below is the equivalent Java code for the given Python code:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // For current working directory
        File fileInDir = new File("input.txt");
        System.out.println(fileInDir.exists() ? "Exists" : "Does not exist"));

        File dirInDir = new File("docs");
        System.out.println(dirInDir.exists() ? "Exists" : "Does not exist"));

        // For file and directory in filesystem root
        File fileInRoot = new File("/input.txt"));
        System.out.println(fileInRoot.exists() ? "Exists" : "Does not exist"));

        File dirInRoot = new File("/docs");
        System.out.println(dirInRoot.exists() ? "Exists" : "Does not exist"));
    }
}
```
This Java code does the same as your Python script: It checks whether a file named `input.txt` exists in the current working directory, and also check for existence of a directory named `docs` in the current working directory. The same process is repeated twice: once for the current working directory, and again for a file and a directory in the filesystem root.
