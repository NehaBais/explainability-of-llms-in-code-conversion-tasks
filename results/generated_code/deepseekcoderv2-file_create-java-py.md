# Solution 1:
The following code creates a new empty file named output.txt in the current working directory and an empty directory called docs both locally and on the root of the filesystem.

Here is the Python implementation of the given Java code:
```python
import os
try:
    # Create a new empty file named "output.txt" in the current working directory
    with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
        pass
    
    # Create an empty directory called "docs" both locally and on the root of the filesystem
    os.makedirs(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "docs"))
    if not os.path.exists("/docs"):
        os.mkdir("/docs")
except IOError as e:
    print("An error occurred:", str(e))
```
# Solution 2:
Another way to create a new empty file named output.txt in the current working directory is by using the built-in open() function with the mode set to "w" which indicates that it should be opened for writing and truncating its contents:

try:
    with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
        pass
except IOError as e:
    print("An error occurred:", str(e))
