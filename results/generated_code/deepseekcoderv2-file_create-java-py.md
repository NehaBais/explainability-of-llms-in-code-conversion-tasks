 Sure, here is the equivalent Python code to achieve the same task:

```python
import os

def create_file_and_directory():
    # Create an empty file called "output.txt" in the current working directory
    with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
        pass
    
    # Create an empty file called "output.txt" in the filesystem root (if supported by the OS)
    if os.name == 'nt':  # Windows
        with open(r"C:\output.txt", "w") as f:
            pass
    else:  # Unix-like systems
        with open("/output.txt", "w") as f:
            pass
    
    # Create an empty directory called "docs" in the current working directory
    os.makedirs("docs", exist_ok=True)
    
    # Create an empty directory called "docs" in the filesystem root (if supported by the OS)
    if os.name == 'nt':  # Windows
        os.makedirs(r"C:\docs", exist_ok=True)
    else:  # Unix-like systems
        os.makedirs("/docs", exist_ok=True)

# Call the function to create files and directories
create_file_and_directory()
```

This Python code will create an empty file called `output.txt` in both the current working directory and the filesystem root, as well as creating an empty directory called `docs` in both locations.
