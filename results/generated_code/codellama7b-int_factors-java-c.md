This is a Java code that computes the factors of a positive integer "n". The output is a set containing all the factors of the number. The factors are positive integers by which the number can be divided to yield a positive integer result. Every prime number has two factors: 1 and itself.
Here is the C code for the same function:
```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
#define MAX_FACTORS 1000

long factors(int n)
{
    long factors[MAX_FACTORS];
    int i;
    factors[0] = n;
    factors[1] = 1L;
    for (i = n - 1; i >= sqrt(n); i--)
    {
        if (n % i == 0)
        {
            factors[2*i] = i;
            factors[(2*i+1)/2] = n / i;
        }
    }
    return factors;
}
```
The code first defines a set of factors which is an array of size MAX_FACTORS. The function then computes the factorization of "n" and stores the results in the factors array. Finally, it returns the factors array.
