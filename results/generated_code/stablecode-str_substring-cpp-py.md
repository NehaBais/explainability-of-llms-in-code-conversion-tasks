The equivalent Python code for the given C++ code is as follows:

```python
def main():
    s = "0123456789"

    n = 3
    m = 4
    c = '2'
    sub = "456"

    print(s[n:n+m]))
    print(s[n:]))
    print(s[:-1])
    print(s[s.find(c)]:m])
    print(s[s.find(sub)]:m])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This Python code performs the same operations as the C++ code provided in the question. It uses string slicing and find functions to retrieve substrings from the given string `s`. The resulting substrings are then printed to the console.
