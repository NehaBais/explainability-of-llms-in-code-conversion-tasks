Here's the JavaScript code that meets the requirements:
```
const s = "12345678";
const newS = "0" + s; // by concatenation
console.log(newS);
```
The variable `s` is initialized with the string `"12345678"`. The variable `newS` is then created by concatenating the string `"0"` to the beginning of `s`. Finally, the value of `newS` is printed to the console.
