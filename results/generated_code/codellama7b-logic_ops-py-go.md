```go
func logic(a bool, b bool) {
    fmt.Println("a and b:", a && b)
    fmt.Println("a or b:", a || b)
    fmt.Println("not a:", !a)
}
```
This is the Golang equivalent of the Python code you provided. The "&&" operator is used in place of "and", "||" is used instead of "or", and "!" is used in place of "not".
