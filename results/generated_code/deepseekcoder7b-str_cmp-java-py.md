Here's the Python equivalent of your Java code:

```python
def compare(A, B):
    if A == B:
        print('\'{}\' and \'{}\' are lexically equal.'.format(A, B))
    else:
        print('\'{}\' and \'{}\' are not lexically equal.'.format(A, B))
    
    if A.lower() == B.lower():
        print('\'{}\' and \'{}\' are case-insensitive lexically equal.'.format(A, B))
    else:
        print('\'{}\' and \'{}\' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.'.format(A, B))
    
    if A < B:
        print('\'{}\' is lexically before \'{}\''.format(A, B))
    elif A > B:
        print('\'{}\' is lexically after \'{}\''.format(A, B))
    
    if A >= B:
        print('\'{}\' is not lexically before \'{}\''.format(A, B))
    if A <= B:
        print('\'{}\' is not lexically after \'{}\''.format(A, B))
        
    print("The lexical relationship is: {}".format(cmp(A, B)))
    print("The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: {}".format(cmp(A.lower(), B.lower())))
    
# Running the comparison on some strings
compare('Hello', 'Hello')
compare('5', '5.0')
compare('java', 'Java')
compare('ĴÃVÁ', 'ĴÃVÁ')
compare('ĴÃVÁ', 'ĵãvá')
```

Please note that in Python, the `cmp()` function is used for lexical comparison. It returns 0 if x == y, -1 if x < y, and 1 if x > y. However, this `cmp()` functionality has been removed from Python3 onwards as it was a bad practice to use in comparisons between strings because the result is not consistent with other languages or libraries (like Java).
