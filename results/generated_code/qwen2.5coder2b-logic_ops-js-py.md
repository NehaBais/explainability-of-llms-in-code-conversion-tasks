Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for the given JavaScript function:

```python
def logic(a, b):
    print(f"a AND b: {a and b}")
    print(f"a OR b: {a or b}")
    print(f"NOT a: {not a}")

logic(True, False)
```

In this Python code, we use f-strings for formatting the output which is similar to JavaScript's template literals. The `or` and `and` operators are used in place of JavaScript's `||` and `&&`. We also use the `not` operator to get the logical negation of a boolean value.
