Here's the equivalent Java code for the given C++ code snippet:
```java
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       String s = "hello";
       System.out.println(s + " literal");
       String s2 = s + " literal";
       System.out.println(s2);
   }
}
```
This Java code creates a string variable `s` with the value "hello" and prints it to the console along with a literal string "literal". It then creates another string variable `s2` by concatenating `s` with the literal string "literal" and prints it to the console. The output of this program would be:

hello literal
hello literal
