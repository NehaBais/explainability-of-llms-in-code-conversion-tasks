Here's the converted code in Rust:
```
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
 println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
 println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
 println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
```
Note that in Rust, the `&&` and `||` operators are used for logical "and" and "or", respectively, while the `!` operator is used for logical "not". Also, the curly braces are used to define the scope of the printed values.
