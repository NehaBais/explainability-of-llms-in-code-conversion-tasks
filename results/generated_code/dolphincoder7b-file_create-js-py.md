The following code in Python creates a new empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory called "docs". It should be done twice: once in the current working directory (CWD) and once at the filesystem root ("/"):
```python
import os

def write_file(path, content):
    with open(path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)


os.chdir('C:\\')  # Change to current working directory (CWD)
write_file("output.txt", "")
os.chdir('/')  # Change back to filesystem root ("/")
write_file("/output.txt", "")

if not os.path.exists('docs'):
    os.mkdir('docs')
```
In the provided code, we first import the necessary module "os" which provides a set of functions and variables that work specifically with the operating system. 

The function `write_file` is used to create an empty file named "output.txt". The path parameter specifies the location where the new file will be created. In the provided code, the current working directory (CWD) and the filesystem root ("/") are used as paths. 

After creating the files, we use the `os.chdir` function to change the current working directory to "docs" in both cases. This function allows you to navigate through directories in a file system. In this case, it changes your CWD to the docs folder and then back to the original CWD. 

Finally, we check if the directory "docs" exists using `os.path.exists`. If it doesn't exist, we create it using `os.mkdir` function. The code will run without any errors as long as you have the necessary permissions.
