Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for comparing two strings in Java to demonstrate different types of string comparisons provided by JavaScript and how they relate to type systems.

```javascript
class Compare {
  static compare(A, B) {
    if (A === B) {
      console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are lexically equal.`);
    } else {
      console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not lexically equal.`);
    }

    if (A.localeCompare(B) < 0) {
      console.log(`'${A}' is lexically before '${B}'`));
    } else if (A.localeCompare(B) > 0) {
      console.log(`'${A}' is lexically after '${B}'`));
    }

    let comparison = A.localeCompare(B);

    if (comparison === 0) {
      console.log(`The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: ${comparison}}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: ${comparison}}`));
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
Compare.compare("Hello", "hello");
Compare.compare("5", "5.0");
Compare.compare("java", "Java");
Compare.compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ");
Compare.compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĵãvá");
```

This JavaScript code demonstrates different types of string comparisons provided by JavaScript:
- Comparing two strings for exact equality
- Comparing two strings for inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality)
- Lexically comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other
- Lexically comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after than the other

Note that JavaScript doesn't have a built-in type system like Java, but you can still perform string comparisons using various methods provided by JavaScript.
