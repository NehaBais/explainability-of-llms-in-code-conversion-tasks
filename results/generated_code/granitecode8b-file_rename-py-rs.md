Here's the Rust code that accomplishes the same task as the Python code you provided:
```
use std::fs;
use std::path::PathBuf;
fn main() {
 let mut path = PathBuf::from("."); // current working directory
 // Rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the current working directory
 fs::rename(path.join("input.txt"), path.join("output.txt")).unwrap();
 // Rename "docs" to "mydocs" in the current working directory
 fs::rename(path.join("docs"), path.join("mydocs")).unwrap();
 // Rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the filesystem root
 path = PathBuf::from("/");
 fs::rename(path.join("input.txt"), path.join("output.txt")).unwrap();
 // Rename "docs" to "mydocs" in the filesystem root
 fs::rename(path.join("docs"), path.join("mydocs")).unwrap();
}
```
This code uses the `std::fs` module to perform file and directory operations, including renaming files and directories. It first creates a `PathBuf` object representing the current working directory using `PathBuf::from(".")`. Then it renames "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the current working directory using `fs::rename`, passing in two `PathBuf` objects representing the source and destination file paths. Finally, it renames "docs" to "mydocs" in the current working directory using the same method.
To rename files or directories in the filesystem root, the code first creates a new `PathBuf` object representing the filesystem root using `PathBuf::from("/")`. Then it uses the same `fs::rename` method to rename the files or directories in the same way as before. Note that you'll need to run this code with administrative privileges to rename files or directories in the filesystem root on Windows.
