Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for your Rust example. It uses string concatenation (`+`) and `print()` to display strings. 

```python
s = "hello"
print(s)

s1 = s + " world"
print(s1)
```

In this Python code, we're basically doing the same thing as in your Rust example: creating and concatenating two string variables `s` and `s1`. Then printing out these strings using print statement.
