 Here's the equivalent Java code for the given C++ program:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "hello";
        System.out.println(s + " literal");
        String s2 = s + " literal";
        System.out.println(s2);
    }
}
```

This Java code performs the same operations as the original C++ code: it initializes a string variable `s` with the value "hello", concatenates " literal" to it, and then prints both strings to the console.
