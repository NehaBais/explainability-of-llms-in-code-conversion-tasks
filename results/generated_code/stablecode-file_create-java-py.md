Here is the Python equivalent of your Java code:

```python
import os
try:
    # Create file "output.txt" twice in current working directory and filesystem root
    with open("output.txt", 'w') as f:
        pass  # Since we want an empty file, just do nothing here

    with open(os.path.join(File.separator, "output.txt")), 'w') as f:
        pass  # Since we want an empty file, just do nothing here


    # Create directory "docs" twice in current working directory and filesystem root
    os.mkdir("docs")

    os.mkdir(os.path.join(File.separator, "docs"))


except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

Note that the given Java code can't run directly because `File` class is not recognized. In Python, we don't have this kind of "File" class in builtins so it needs to be imported from `os` module or other modules like `pathlib`. 

In this case, I've used the `os` module for path-related operations and file-system related operations.
