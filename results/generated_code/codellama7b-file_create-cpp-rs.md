Here's the Rust equivalent of the given C++ code:
```
use std::fs;
use std::os::raw::c_int;

fn main() {
    let mut file = fs::File::create("output.txt").unwrap();
    file.sync_all().unwrap();
    drop(file);

    fs::create_dir("docs").unwrap();
    drop(fs::create_dir("/docs"));
}
```
Explanation:

* `use std::fs;` brings the `std::fs` module into scope, which provides functions for interacting with the file system.
* `use std::os::raw::c_int;` is used to bring the `c_int` type into scope, which is used by some of the Rust standard library functions.
* `fn main()` defines a new function called `main`, which is the entry point for the program.
* `let mut file = fs::File::create("output.txt").unwrap();` creates a new `fs::File` object and assigns it to the variable `file`. The `mut` keyword indicates that the variable can be modified. The `fs::File::create()` function is used to create a new file with the specified name, and the `.unwrap()` method is used to unwrap any potential errors that may occur during the creation process.
* `file.sync_all().unwrap();` synchronizes all data on the file system associated with the file object with the underlying storage device. This ensures that any changes made to the file are persisted and are available for future use. The `.unwrap()` method is used again to unwrap any potential errors that may occur during the synchronization process.
* `drop(file);` drops the `fs::File` object, which releases any resources associated with it. This is necessary because Rust's ownership system requires that we explicitly release resources when we are done using them.
* `fs::create_dir("docs").unwrap();` creates a new directory called "docs" in the current working directory. The `.unwrap()` method is used again to unwrap any potential errors that may occur during the creation process.
* `drop(fs::create_dir("/docs"));` drops the `fs::File` object returned by the `fs::create_dir()` function, which releases any resources associated with it. This is necessary because Rust's ownership system requires that we explicitly release resources when we are done using them.
* The program ends with a call to the `drop(file)` function, which ensures that any resources associated with the file object are properly released.
