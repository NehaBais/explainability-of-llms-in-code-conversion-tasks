Answer: In Python, you can use the string concatenation operator + to combine two strings. Here's how it would look in Golang:
```
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
s := "12345678"
// Append a 0 before s using string concatenation
s = "0" + s
fmt.Println(s)
}
```
In this example, the variable `s` is assigned the value of "12345678", and then it's concatenated with the string literal "0" to create a new string that starts with "0". The resulting string is printed out using fmt.Println(), which prints its argument(s) followed by a newline character (similar to println in Python).

The code in Golang equivalent to the provided Python script would be:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
// Define your string variable and initial value here.
// For example, let's use an integer that we convert to a string representation of its base 10 value:
var strNum int = 987654321 // This is an integer literal in decimal notation (base-10).
strNumStr := fmt.Sprintf("%d", strNum) // Convert the integer into its text representation using Sprintf function from fmt package and assign it to a new variable called 'strNumStr'. Note that this assumes ASCII encoding for character set; if you wanted unicode characters instead, replace "%d" with "%U".
// Now we have our string ready! Let's prepend another substring:
finalString := "1234567890" + strNumStr // Concatenate the two strings together using concatenation operator (+) or join them together if desired.
fmt.Println(finalString) // Print out final result to console
}
