In Java, you can use the `+=` operator to concatenate a string literal with an existing string variable. Here's the converted code:
```
// Converted from Python to Java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "12345678";
        str += "9!";
        System.out.println(str);
    }
}
```
Note that in Java, the `+=` operator is used to concatenate a string literal with an existing string variable, whereas in Python, the `+` operator is used for both string concatenation and numerical addition. Also, in Java, you need to use the `System.out.println()` method to print the contents of a string variable to the console.
