Sure, here's the equivalent JavaScript code:
```
let greeting = "Hello";
greeting += ", world!";
console.log(greeting);
```
This code creates a string variable called `greeting` and assigns it the value of "Hello". It then appends the string ", world!" to the end of the `greeting` variable using the `+=` operator. Finally, it prints the contents of the `greeting` variable to the console using `console.log()`.
