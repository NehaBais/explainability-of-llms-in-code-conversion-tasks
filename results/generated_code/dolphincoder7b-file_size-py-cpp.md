```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <sys/stat.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    struct stat fileInfo;

    if (stat("input.txt", &fileInfo) != 0){
        cout << "Cannot access input.txt: " << strerror(errno);
        exit(-1);
    }

    size_t size = fileInfo.st_size;
    cout << "Size of input.txt is : " << size << " bytes." << endl;

    if (stat("/input.txt", &fileInfo) != 0){
        cout << "Cannot access /input.txt: " << strerror(errno);
        exit(-1);
    }

    size = fileInfo.st_size;

```

The Python `os` module provides system functions to interact with the file system and execute shell commands, which are not available in C++. C++ only supports a subset of its functionality compared to Python's fully-featured OS library. However, it still offers some basic file manipulation functionalities such as getting file sizes using `stat()`. 

In this code, we first check if we can access the file named "input.txt" in our current working directory and get its size by calling the `stat()` function with the path name "input.txt". We then print out the size of the file. Next, we repeat the process to get the size of a file named "/input.txt" which is located at the root directory of the filesystem. 

Note: For Linux systems, the "/" symbol refers to the root directory. In Windows, it represents the current drive (C:\ for C drive and so on). Therefore, the correct way to access the file in the root directory would be "/input.txt" in this context. The equivalent code in Python would be `os.path.getsize('/')`.
