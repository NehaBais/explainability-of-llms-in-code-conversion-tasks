Here's the equivalent Java code:

```java
public class Logic {
    public static void printLogic(boolean a, boolean b) {
        System.out.println("a && b is " + (a && b)));
        System.out.println("a || b is " + (a || b)));
        System.out.println("not a is " + (!a)));
    }
}
```
This Java function `printLogic` takes two boolean values as input parameters, and then prints the result of "and" and "or" on both arguments as well as "not" on the first argument.
