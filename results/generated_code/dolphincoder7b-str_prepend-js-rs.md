To convert the JavaScript code to Rust, we can use a simple approach like the following:
```rust
let mut s = ", World".to_string(); // Create a string variable equal to any text value.
s.insert(0, "Hello ");  // Prepend the string variable with another string literal.
println!("{}", s);
```
This code creates a mutable `String` variable `s`, inserts the value "Hello" at index 0 (the beginning of the string), and then prints the result to the console using `println!`. The `to_string()` method is used to convert the `&str` literal into a `String` for manipulation.
In Rust, it's good practice to use the `mut` keyword to indicate that a variable can be modified in place. Also note that the `insert` method takes a single character and an index as arguments, so we must specify the number of characters we want to insert by passing 0. If you have more than one character to prepend, you will need to adjust this accordingly.
Finally, `println!` is Rust's built-in macro for formatting and printing strings or other data types. You can learn more about it [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html).
