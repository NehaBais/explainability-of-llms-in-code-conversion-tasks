 Sure, here is the equivalent Python code to achieve the same functionality as your Go program:

```python
import os

def main():
    # In the current working directory
    os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
    os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
    
    # In the filesystem root (assuming you have the necessary permissions)
    os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
    os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code performs the same operations as your Go program: it renames `input.txt` to `output.txt` and `docs` to `mydocs`, both in the current working directory and in the filesystem root.
