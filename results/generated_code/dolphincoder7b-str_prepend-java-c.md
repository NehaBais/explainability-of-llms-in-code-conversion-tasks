This problem requires knowledge of Java syntax and cannot be directly converted into C language as there is no direct equivalent in the C programming language for defining a string variable or concatenating two strings. However, we can convert this code to a similar structure in C++. Here's the corresponding C++ code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    // Initialize the string variable
    string str = "def";

    // Prepend the string with another string literal
    str = "abc" + str;

    // Output the result
    cout << "Result: " << str << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In this code, we have included `iostream` to use `cout` for output and defined a string variable called `str`. Then, we concatenate two string literals ("abc" and "def") using the plus (+) operator and assign it back to the original variable. Finally, we display the resulting string by concatenating the result with "Result: ".
Please note that C++ is a popular language used for writing programs that run on systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. The syntax of these languages can differ from other programming languages, and this code may not work in all environments without modifications.
