Here's the equivalent code in Rust:
```
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
 println!("a and b: {}", a && b);
 println!("a or b: {}", a || b);
 println!("not a: {}", !a);
}
```
Note that the `&&` and `||` operators are used for logical "and" and "or", respectively, while the `!` operator is used for logical "not". The `println!` macro is used to print the results.
