Here's the converted Python code that verifies the existence of a file called "input.txt" and a directory called "docs" in the current working directory and in the filesystem root:
```
import os
def verify_file_and_dir(path):
 if os.path.isfile(path) or os.path.isdir(path):
 return True
 else:
 return False
current_working_directory = os.getcwd()
if verify_file_and_dir("input.txt") and verify_file_and_dir("docs"):
 print("Input file and directory exist in the current working directory.")
else:
 print("Input file or directory does not exist in the current working directory.")
filesystem_root = "/"
if verify_file_and_dir(filesystem_root + "input.txt") and verify_file_and_dir(filesystem_root + "docs"):
 print("Input file and directory exist in the filesystem root.")
else:
 print("Input file or directory does not exist in the filesystem root.")
```
In this code, we first import the `os` module to access the operating system's functionality. We then define a function called `verify_file_and_dir` that takes a path as an argument and returns True if the path points to a file or directory, and False otherwise.
We then use the `os.getcwd()` method to get the current working directory and store it in the variable `current_working_directory`. We call the `verify_file_and_dir` function twice for the input file and directory in the current working directory. If both calls return True, we print a message indicating that the files exist. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that at least one of the files does not exist.
Next, we set the variable `filesystem_root` to the root directory ("/") and call the `verify_file_and_dir` function twice for the input file and directory in the filesystem root. If both calls return True, we print a message indicating that the files exist. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that at least one of the files does not exist.
