 Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the provided C++ program:

```javascript
let s = "hello";
console.log(s + " literal");
let s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```

This code initializes a string variable `s` with the value "hello", then logs to the console the concatenation of `s` and the string " literal". It then creates another string variable `s2` that is the original string concatenated with " literal" and also logs this new string to the console.
