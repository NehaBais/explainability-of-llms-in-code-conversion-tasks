The equivalent Python code for this Java snippet is as follows:

```python
adjective = "big"
lyric = f"Mary had a {adjective} lamb."
print(lyric)
```

This uses an 'f-string', also known as an 'formatted string literal'. It's a feature of Python 3.6 and above that allows for easier and more readable string interpolation (also called string formatting). The placeholders in the f-string are replaced with variables or expressions inside braces {}.
