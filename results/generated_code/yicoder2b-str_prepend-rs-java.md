Sure, here is how you can convert the above code into Java:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "World";
        s = "Hello " + s;
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```
This Java code does the exact same thing as your original Rust code: it creates a string, appends another string to it, and then prints out the resulting string.
