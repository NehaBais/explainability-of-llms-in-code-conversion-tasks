Here is the converted code from C to C++ that meets the given requirements:
```
#include 
using namespace std;
void bitwise(int a, int b)
{
 cout << "a and b: " << (a & b) << endl;
 cout << "a or b: " << (a | b) << endl;
 cout << "a xor b: " << (a ^ b) << endl;
 cout << "not a: " << (~a) << endl;
 cout << "a << n: " << (a << b) << endl; // left shift
 cout << "a >> n: " << (a >> b) << endl; // on most platforms: arithmetic right shift
 unsigned int c = a;
 cout << "c >> b: " << (c >> b) << endl; // logical right shift
 
 // there are no rotation operators in C, so we'll simulate them using bitwise operations
 unsigned int mask = (1 << b) - 1;
 unsigned int rotated_left = ((a << b) & mask) | (a >> (32 - b));
 cout << "rotated left: " << rotated_left << endl;
 
 unsigned int rotated_right = ((a >> b) & mask) | (a << (32 - b));
 cout << "rotated right: " << rotated_right << endl;
 
 return 0;
}
int main() {
 bitwise(10, 5); // example usage
 return 0;
}
```
This code includes the necessary header file and uses namespace std to avoid having to prefix standard library functions with std::. The left shift, right shift, and logical right shift operators are used for shifting the first integer by the second integer amount. However, since C does not have a built-in rotation operator, we simulate them using bitwise operations. A mask is created to extract the bits that will be shifted out of the first integer during the rotation operation. Then, the bits from the first integer are shifted into the vacant space and combined with the bits that were shifted out to create the rotated result.
