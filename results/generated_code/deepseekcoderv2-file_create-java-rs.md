 To convert the given Java code to Rust, we need to handle file creation and directory creation using Rust's standard library. Here is how you can achieve this in Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Create "output.txt" in the current working directory
    fs::File::create("output.txt")?;
    
    // Create "output.txt" in the filesystem root (assuming Unix-like path)
    fs::File::create("/output.txt")?;
    
    // Create "docs" directory in the current working directory
    fs::DirBuilder::new().create("docs")?;
    
    // Create "docs" directory in the filesystem root (assuming Unix-like path)
    fs::DirBuilder::new().create("/docs")?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **File Creation**: 
   - `fs::File::create("output.txt")?` creates a new file named "output.txt" in the current working directory.
   - `fs::File::create("/output.txt")?` attempts to create a file named "output.txt" in the root directory (assuming Unix-like path for simplicity).
   
2. **Directory Creation**:
   - `fs::DirBuilder::new().create("docs")?` creates an empty directory named "docs" in the current working directory.
   - `fs::DirBuilder::new().create("/docs")?` attempts to create a directory named "docs" in the root directory (assuming Unix-like path for simplicity).

### Notes:
- The Rust code uses the standard library's file and directory creation functions (`fs::File::create` and `fs::DirBuilder::new().create` respectively).
- The `?` operator is used to handle potential errors, and the function returns `io::Result<()>` which is a convenient way to handle errors in Rust.
- This code assumes Unix-like paths for simplicity; for Windows paths, you would need to adjust the path separator and potentially use different functions (e.g., `std::fs::create_dir`).
