Sure! Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your Python example:

```javascript
let extra = 'little';
let newStr = `Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`;
console.log(newStr);
```

In this JavaScript code, we use template literals (which are enclosed in backticks) to perform string interpolation. The `${extra}` inside the template literal will be replaced with the value of `extra`, resulting in the desired output.
