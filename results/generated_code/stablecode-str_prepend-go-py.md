In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. Also, Python uses "+" operator for string concatenation. Here's how you can rewrite the given Golang code in Python:

```python
s = "world!"
s = "Hello, " + s
```
This Python script does exactly what your Golang code was doing - it creates a string variable `s` with any text value, then prepends another string literal `"Hello, "` to the beginning of `s`.
