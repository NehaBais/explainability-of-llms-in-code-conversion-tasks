Sure, here is how you can convert this code from Java into JavaScript:

```javascript
let string = "def"; 
string = "abc" + string;
```
In the above JavaScript code, we are using let keyword to declare the variable 'string' which is initialized with a text value. The assignment operator (+) is used to concatenate (combine and bind together) the values of the two operands string literal "abc" and the variable 'string'.
