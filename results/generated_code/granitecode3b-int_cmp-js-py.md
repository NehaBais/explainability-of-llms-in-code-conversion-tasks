Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task as the JavaScript code:
```
# Get two integers from the user
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))

# Display a message if the first integer is:
# less than, equal to, or greater than the second integer
if a < b:
 print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
elif a == b:
 print(f"{a} equals {b}")
else:
 print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```
This Python code uses type coercion to compare the two integers, but it's otherwise similar to the JavaScript code. It first gets two integers from the user using the `input()` function and stores them in variables `a` and `b`. Then, it displays a message if `a` is less than, equal to, or greater than `b`, depending on the result of the comparison.
