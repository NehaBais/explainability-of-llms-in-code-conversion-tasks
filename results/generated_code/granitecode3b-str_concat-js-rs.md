Sure! Here's the equivalent Rust code:
```rust
fn main() {
 let s = "hello";
 let t = format!("{} there!", s);
 println!("{}", s);
 println!("{}", t);
}
```
This code declares two string variables `s` and `t`. The first variable `s` is assigned the value `"hello"` using a simple assignment statement. The second variable `t` is created by concatenating the value of `s` with the string literal `" there!"`. Finally, both variables are printed to the console using the `println!` macro.
