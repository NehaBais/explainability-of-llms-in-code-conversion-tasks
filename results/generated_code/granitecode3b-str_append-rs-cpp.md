The C++ code for the given Rust code is as follows:
```c++
#include 
int main() {
 std::string hello = "Hello world";
 hello += "!!!!";
 std::cout << hello << std::endl;
 return 0;
}
```
Both codes achieve the same result, but the C++ code uses the `+=` operator to append the string literal `"!!!!"` to the `hello` variable. The output of both codes will be: `Hello world!!!!`
