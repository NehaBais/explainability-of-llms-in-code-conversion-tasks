 To convert the given Python code to Rust, we need to create a new empty file called `output.txt` and an empty directory called `docs` in both the current working directory and the filesystem root. Below is the equivalent Rust code for this task:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Create in the current working directory
    create(".");
    
    // Create in the root directory
    create("/");
    
    Ok(())
}

fn create(directory: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
    let path = format!("{}/output.txt", directory);
    fs::File::create(&path)?;
    fs::create_dir(format!("{}/docs", directory))?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Explanation:
1. We import necessary modules from the standard library: `std::fs` for file operations and `std::io` for input/output operations.
2. The main function is defined with a return type of `io::Result<()>`. It calls the `create` function twice, once for the current working directory (`"."`) and once for the root directory (`"/"`).
3. The `create` function takes a directory path as an argument, formats it to create the file and directory paths, and then uses `fs::File::create` to create the empty file and `fs::create_dir` to create the empty directory.
4. Each operation returns an `io::Result<()>`, which is handled by the main function using `?`. If any operation fails, it will propagate the error up to the caller.
