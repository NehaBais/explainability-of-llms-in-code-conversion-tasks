Here's the C code that corresponds to the given Golang code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void bitwise(short a, short b) {
    printf("a:   %016b\n", (unsigned short)(a));
    printf("b:   %016b\n", (unsigned short)(b));

    // Bitwise logical operations
    printf("and: %016b\n", (unsigned short)(a & b));
    printf("or:  %016b\n", (unsigned short)(a | b));
    printf("xor: %016b\n", (unsigned short)(a ^ b));
    printf("not: %016b\n", (unsigned short)(~a));

    if (b < 0) {
        printf("Right operand is negative, but all shifts require an unsigned right operand (shift distance).\n");
        return;
    }
    unsigned short ua = (unsigned short)(a);
    int ub = (int)(b);

    // Logical shifts (unsigned left operand)
    printf("shl: %016b\n", (unsigned short)(ua << ub));
    printf("shr: %016b\n", (unsigned short)(ua >> ub));

    // Arithmetic shifts (signed left operand)
    printf("las: %016b\n", (short)(a << ub));
    printf("ras: %016b\n", (short)(a >> ub));

    // Rotations
    printf("rol: %016b\n", (unsigned short)((a << ub) | ((short)(a) >> (16 - ub))));
    printf("ror: %016b\n", (unsigned short)(((short)(a) >> ub) | (a << (16 - ub))));
}

int main() {
    short a = -460, b = 6;
    bitwise(a, b);
    return 0;
}
```
The C code is functionally equivalent to the Golang code. However, there are some differences in how the data types are represented and handled. For example:

* In C, integers are represented using the `int` type, which can hold values from -32768 to 32767. The Golang code uses the `short` type, which is a 16-bit signed integer.
* In C, bitwise operations are performed on unsigned integers, while in Go, they are performed on signed integers. This means that the results of bitwise operations in C will be different from those in Go if there are any negative numbers involved.
* In C, logical shifts (i.e., shifting with a negative shift distance) are undefined behavior, while in Go, they wrap around to the other end of the number space. This means that the results of logical shifts in C will be different from those in Go if there are any negative numbers involved.
* In C, arithmetic shifts (i.e., shifting with a negative shift distance) fill in the highest-order bits with copies of the sign bit, while in Go, they wrap around to the other end of the number space. This means that the results of arithmetic shifts in C will be different from those in Go if there are any negative numbers involved.
* In C, rotations (i.e., left rotating a number by a negative amount) are undefined behavior, while in Go, they wrap around to the other end of the number space. This means that the results of rotations in C will be different from those in Go if there are any negative numbers involved.

Overall, the C code is functionally equivalent to the Golang code, but there are some differences in how the data types are represented and handled. It's important to keep these differences in mind when translating between the two languages.
