In Python, you can use the `+=` operator to concatenate strings. Here's how you can convert your Java code to Python:

```python
class strAppend:
    def main(self):
        string = "abc"
        print(string)
        string += "def"
        print(string)
```

This will work exactly as in your Java code, appending the string literal "def" to "abc".
