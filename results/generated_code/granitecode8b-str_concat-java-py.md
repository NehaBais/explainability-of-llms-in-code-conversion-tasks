Here is the Python code that meets the given requirements:
```python
s = "hello"
print(s + " literal")
s2 = s + " literal"
print(s2)
```
In this code, we first create a string variable `s` and assign it the value `"hello"`. We then concatenate the value of `s` with the string literal `" literal"` using the `+` operator, and store the result in a new string variable `s2`. Finally, we print the contents of both variables to the console.
