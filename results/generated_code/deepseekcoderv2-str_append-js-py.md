 Here's how you can convert the given JavaScript code to Python:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value.
s1 = "Hello"

# Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way.
s1 += ", World!"

# Show the contents of the variable after the append operation.
print(s1)
```

This Python code does exactly what your JavaScript code does: it initializes a string `s1` with "Hello", appends ", World!" to it, and then prints the resulting string.
