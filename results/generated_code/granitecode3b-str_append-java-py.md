Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task as the Java code:
```
string = "abc"
print(string)
string += "def"
print(string)
```
The output of this code will be:
abc
abcdef
In Python, strings are immutable, so we can't directly append a new string to an existing one like in Java. Instead, we use the `+=` operator to concatenate two strings together. This creates a new string that contains both original and new strings.
