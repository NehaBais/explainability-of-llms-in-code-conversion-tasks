## C Code Generated from Rust code
The provided C code is the result of converting the given Rust code into C language using an online tool that supports translation between programming languages.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
    char a[] = "abc";
    char b[] = "Bac";
    if (strcmp(a, b) == 0) {
        printf("The strings are equal\n");
    } else {
         printf("Strings are not equal\n");
     };
    if (strcmp(a, b) != 0) {
        printf("The strings are not equal\n");
    };
    if (strcmp(a, b) > 0) {
        printf("The first string is lexically after the second\n");
    } else{
         printf("The first string is lexicographically before the second\n");
     };
    if (strcmp(a, b) < 0) {
        printf("The first string is lexically before the second\n");
    };
    if (strcmp(a, b) >= 0) {
        printf("The first string is not lexicographically after the second\n");
    };
    if (strcmp(a, b) <= 0) {
        printf("The first string is not lexically before the second\n");
     }
    return 0;
}

## Rust Code Analysis:
This C code implements a basic comparison of two strings, `a` and `b`, in Rust. It checks for equality (`==`) and inequality (`!=`), as well as lexicographical ordering (`>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`) between the strings. Additionally, it demonstrates case-insensitivity with `.eq_ignore_ascii_case()`.

In this C code, `strcmp` from `<string.h>` is used to compare two strings (`a` and `b`). It checks for equality using the equality operator `==`, inequality with the not equal to operator `!=`, as well as lexicographical ordering with comparison operators `<`, `>`, `>=`, and `<=`. The code also demonstrates case-insensitivity through `.eq_ignore_ascii_case()`.
