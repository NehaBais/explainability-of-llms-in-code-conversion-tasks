 To convert the given Rust code to C and demonstrate similar string comparisons, we need to handle various aspects such as comparing strings for equality/inequality, lexicographical comparison, case sensitivity, and numeric string handling. Here's how you can achieve this in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int main() {
    // Define the strings
    const char *a = "abc";
    char b[] = "Bac";

    // Compare two strings for exact equality and inequality
    if (strcmp(a, b) == 0) {
        printf("The strings are equal\n");
    } else {
        printf("The strings are not equal\n");
    }

    // Compare two strings for inequality (inverse of exact equality)
    if (strcmp(a, b) != 0) {
        printf("The strings are not equal\n");
    } else {
        printf("The strings are equal\n");
    }

    // Compare two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before the other
    if (strcmp(a, b) > 0) {
        printf("The first string is lexically after the second\n");
    } else if (strcmp(a, b) < 0) {
        printf("The first string is lexically before the second\n");
    } else {
        printf("Both strings are lexicographically equal\n");
    }

    // Compare two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after the other
    if (strcmp(a, b) < 0) {
        printf("The first string is lexically before the second\n");
    } else if (strcmp(a, b) > 0) {
        printf("The first string is lexically after the second\n");
    } else {
        printf("Both strings are lexicographically equal\n");
    }

    // Case-insensitive comparison using toupper function from <ctype.h>
    char a_upper[strlen(a) + 1];
    char b_upper[strlen(b) + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(a); i++) {
        a_upper[i] = toupper((unsigned char)a[i]);
    }
    a_upper[strlen(a)] = '\0';
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(b); i++) {
        b_upper[i] = toupper((unsigned char)b[i]);
    }
    b_upper[strlen(b)] = '\0';

    // Equality in a case-insensitive manner
    if (strcmp(a_upper, b_upper) == 0) {
        printf("Both strings are equal when ignoring case\n");
    }

    // Numeric string comparison is done lexicographically unless explicitly handled differently
    const char *num1 = "123";
    const char *num2 = "124";

    if (strcmp(num1, num2) < 0) {
        printf("The first numeric string is lexically before the second\n");
    } else if (strcmp(num1, num2) > 0) {
        printf("The first numeric string is lexically after the second\n");
    } else {
        printf("Both numeric strings are equal\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **String Comparison**: The `strcmp` function from `<string.h>` is used to compare two C-strings for equality and ordering.
2. **Case Insensitivity**: We convert both strings to uppercase using the `toupper` function from `<ctype.h>` and then compare them. This provides a basic case-insensitive comparison.
3. **Lexicographical Comparison**: The result of `strcmp` indicates whether one string is lexicographically less than, equal to, or greater than another string.
4. **Numeric String Handling**: Numeric strings are compared lexically by default, which means "123" comes before "124" because "1" is the same and "2" in "123" is less than "2" in "124".
5. **Case Sensitivity**: The provided C code does not inherently handle case sensitivity without additional conversions, as shown with `toupper`.

This conversion maintains the functionality of comparing strings for equality/inequality, lexicographical order, and basic case insensitivity, while also demonstrating how numeric strings are compared lexically by default.
