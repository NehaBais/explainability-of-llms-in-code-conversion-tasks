Here is the converted code from JavaScript to C++ for renaming a file called input.txt into output.txt and a directory called docs into mydocs, both in the current working directory and in the filesystem root:
```
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 std::string currentDirectory = "."; // current working directory
 std::string sourceFile = "input.txt";
 std::string destinationFile = "output.txt";
 std::string sourceDirectory = "docs";
 std::string destinationDirectory = "mydocs";
 
 // rename file in current directory
 std::string command = "mv " + currentDirectory + "/" + sourceFile + " " + currentDirectory + "/" + destinationFile;
 system(command.c_str());
 // rename file in filesystem root
 command = "sudo mv /" + sourceFile + " /" + destinationFile;
 system(command.c_str());
 
 // rename directory in current directory
 command = "mv " + currentDirectory + "/" + sourceDirectory + " " + currentDirectory + "/" + destinationDirectory;
 system(command.c_str());
 // rename directory in filesystem root
 command = "sudo mv /" + sourceDirectory + " /" + destinationDirectory;
 system(command.c_str());
 
 return 0;
}
```
Note: The code above assumes that the user has the necessary permissions to move files and directories. In a production environment, it is recommended to check for errors and handle them appropriately. Additionally, the code above uses the `system` function to execute shell commands, which may not be the most secure approach. It is recommended to use a safer method such as the standard library or a third-party library for executing system commands in C++.
