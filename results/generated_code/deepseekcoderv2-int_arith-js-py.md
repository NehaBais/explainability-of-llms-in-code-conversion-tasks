 Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for the given JavaScript code:

```python
import sys

# Get two integers from the user (command line arguments)
a = int(sys.argv[1])
b = int(sys.argv[2])

# Perform operations and display results
sum_result = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
division = a / b  # This will perform floating-point division
remainder = a % b  # This produces the remainder after dividing 'b' into 'a'
quotient = divmod(a, b)  # Returns both quotient and remainder as a tuple
exponentiation = a ** b  # Perform exponentiation if needed

# Display results
print(f'a + b = {sum_result}')
print(f'a - b = {difference}')
print(f'a * b = {product}')
print(f'a / b (quotient) = {int(division)}')  # For integer quotient, use int() to truncate towards zero
print(f'a % b (remainder) = {remainder}')
if sys.version_info[0] >= 3 and sys.version_info[1] >= 6:  # Check Python version for f-string formatting
    print(f'a ** b (exponentiation) = {exponentiation}')
```

This script expects two command line arguments, `a` and `b`, which are integers provided by the user. The code performs various arithmetic operations on these integers and prints the results to the console. Note that Python uses `/` for floating-point division and `//` for integer division (which truncates towards zero). For the quotient, we use `int()` to truncate towards zero when converting the result of floating-point division.
