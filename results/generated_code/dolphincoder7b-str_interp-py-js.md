```javascript
let extra = 'little';
let newStr = `Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`;
console.log(newStr);
```
In JavaScript, we use template literals to perform string interpolation. The `${}` syntax is used within the backticks. When we need to dynamically replace parts of a string with variables or expressions, we use this format. For example, `Mary had a ${extra} lamb.` will output "Mary had a little lamb." in JavaScript.
