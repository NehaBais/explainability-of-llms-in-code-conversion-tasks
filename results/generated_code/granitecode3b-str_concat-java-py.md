Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task as the Java code:
```
s = "hello"
print(s + " literal")
s2 = s + " literal"
print(s2)
```
In this Python code, we first create a string variable `s` and assign it the value of "hello". We then print the value of `s` concatenated with the string literal "literal". 
Next, we create another string variable `s2` and assign it the value of `s` concatenated with the string literal "literal". We then print the value of `s2`. 
When you run this Python code, you should see two lines of output:

hello literal
helloworld literal

This demonstrates that the variables `s` and `s2` contain the correct values after they have been concatenated with the string literal.
