In Python, the `os` and `pathlib` libraries can be used to create a new empty file as well as an empty directory. The `shutil` library can be used to change the working directory. Here's how you could implement this in Python:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import shutil

# Create new empty files in the current working directory and root directory
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    pass
os.system("cd / && touch output.txt")

Path().mkdir(path='docs', parents=True, exist_ok=True)
shutil.rmtree("/docs")  # remove the directory if it exists

# Create new empty files in the root directory and current working directory
os.system("touch /output.txt")
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    pass
Path('/').mkdir(path='docs', parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```

Please note that the `shutil.rmtree("/docs")` line is not a standard function in Python. This example uses it because "docs" directory may already exist and this could cause an error if you try to delete it without removing its contents first. If you are sure that the directory exists, then you can remove it by simply calling `shutil.rmtree("/docs")`.
