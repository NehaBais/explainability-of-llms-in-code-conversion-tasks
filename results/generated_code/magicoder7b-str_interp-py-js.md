 In JavaScript, you can use template literals to achieve this kind of interpolation. Here is the equivalent code in JS:

```js
let extra = 'little';
let newStr = `Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`;
console.log(newStr);
```
In this JavaScript code, `${extra}` is where the value or variable 'extra' will be interpolated into the string. When we run this code, it will print "Mary had a little lamb."
