Here's the Python code that achieves the same functionality as the given C code:
```
def print_logic(a, b):
 print("a and b is", a and b)
 print("a or b is", a or b)
 print("not a is", not a)
```
In this Python code, we define a function called `print_logic` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are assumed to be logical (boolean) values. We then use the `and`, `or`, and `not` operators to perform the desired operations on these arguments, and print the results using the `print` function.
