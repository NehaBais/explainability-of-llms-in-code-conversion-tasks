 Sure! Below is the equivalent Python code for the provided Golang code:

```python
def main():
    # Get two integers from the user
    a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
    b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))
    
    # Display their sum
    print(f"{a} + {b} = {a + b}")
    
    # Display their difference
    print(f"{a} - {b} = {a - b}")
    
    # Display their product
    print(f"{a} * {b} = {a * b}")
    
    # Display their integer quotient (truncates towards zero)
    quotient = a // b
    print(f"{a} / {b} = {quotient}")
    
    # Display their remainder (same sign as the first operand)
    remainder = a % b
    print(f"{a} % {b} = {remainder}")
    
    # No exponentiation operator in Python, so we use ** for demonstration
    print(f"{a} ** {b} = {a ** b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code performs the same operations as the original Golang code:
1. Gets two integers from the user.
2. Displays their sum, difference, product, integer quotient (truncates towards zero), remainder, and exponentiation using the `**` operator for demonstration purposes since Python does not have a specific exponentiation operator like Golang's `^`.
