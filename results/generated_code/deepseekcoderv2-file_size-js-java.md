 Sure! Here is the equivalent Java code to verify the size of a file called `input.txt` for both the current working directory and the root directory:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileSizeChecker {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Check the size of input.txt in the current working directory
        File file1 = new File("input.txt");
        if (file1.exists()) {
            System.out.println("Size of input.txt in current directory: " + file1.length() + " bytes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("File input.txt does not exist in the current directory.");
        }

        // Check the size of input.txt in the root directory (C:)
        File file2 = new File("c:/input.txt");
        if (file2.exists()) {
            System.out.println("Size of input.txt in root directory: " + file2.length() + " bytes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("File input.txt does not exist in the root directory.");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code uses the `java.io.File` class to check if the files exist and then prints their sizes if they do. Note that on Windows, the file path should be prefixed with a drive letter (e.g., `c:`). If you are running this on a different operating system, adjust the paths accordingly.
