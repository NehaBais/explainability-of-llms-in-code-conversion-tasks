Below is the equivalent Java code:

```java
import java.io.*;
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        File file = new File("input.txt");
        if (file.exists())
            file.renameTo(new File("output.txt"));

        File dir = new File("docs");
        if (dir.isDirectory() && dir.exists())
            dir.renameTo(new File("mydocs"));
    }
}
```
In this example, the renaming is done using the `File` class in Java's standard library. The `File` class allows you to create and manipulate files and directories on the filesystem. To rename a file or directory, you can use the `renameTo()` method. You need to specify the new name for the file/directory as an instance of `File`. 

The second part of this code is only performed in case the current working directory and the root filesystem (if any) are on different drives. If they aren't, there's no point in moving files between them. 

Note that this is a simplified example, you might want to do more error handling and make sure that the inputs are valid before attempting to rename or move. Also, note that the `ActiveXObject` class is not available in Java. It's used here for JavaScript compatibility but it's not part of the core Java library.
