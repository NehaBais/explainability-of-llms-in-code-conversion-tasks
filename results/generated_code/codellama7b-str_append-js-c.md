  Here is the C code that meets your requirements:
```
char* s1 = "Hello"; // Create a string variable equal to any text value.
s1 = strcat(s1, ", World!"); // Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way.
printf("%s\n", s1); // Show the contents of the variable after the append operation.
```
