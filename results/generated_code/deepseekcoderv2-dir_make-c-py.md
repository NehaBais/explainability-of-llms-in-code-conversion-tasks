 Certainly! Below is the Python implementation of the given C code using the `os` and `os.path` modules to create a directory and any missing parent directories.

```python
import os
import sys

def mkdir_p(path):
    if not path:
        return
    
    # Normalize the path by replacing backslashes with slashes on Windows
    normalized_path = os.path.normpath(path)
    
    # Split the path into parts
    parts = []
    while '/' in normalized_path:
        part, normalized_path = normalized_path.split('/', 1)
        parts.append(part)
    parts.append(normalized_path)
    
    # Construct the full path
    current_path = ''
    for part in parts:
        current_path = os.path.join(current_path, part)
        if not os.path.isdir(current_path):
            os.mkdir(current_path)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("usage: {} <path>".format(os.path.basename(sys.argv[0])))
        sys.exit(1)
    
    path = sys.argv[1]
    mkdir_p(path)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Normalization and Splitting**: The script normalizes the input path by replacing backslashes with slashes on Windows (if applicable). It then splits the path into its constituent parts.
2. **Creating Directories**: For each part of the path, it constructs a full path. If the directory does not exist, it creates it using `os.mkdir()`.
3. **Error Handling**: The script checks if the provided path is valid and ensures that only directories are created.
4. **Usage Message**: It prints a usage message if the number of command-line arguments is incorrect.

This implementation should work similarly on both Unix-like systems and Windows, mimicking the behavior of the `mkdir -p` command in POSIX environments.
