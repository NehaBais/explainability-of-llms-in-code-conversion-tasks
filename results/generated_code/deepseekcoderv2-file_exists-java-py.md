 Here's how you can convert the given Java code to Python:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

def check_file_and_directory(path):
    file_path = Path(path, "docs/input.txt")
    directory_path = Path(path, "/docs")
    
    exists_in_current = file_path.exists() and directory_path.exists()
    print(f"File {file_path} and directory {directory_path} exist: {exists_in_current}")

# Check for the current working directory
check_file_and_directory(".")

# Check for the filesystem root (assuming '/' is the root)
check_file_and_directory("/")
```

This Python script defines a function `check_file_and_directory` that takes a path as an argument, constructs the file and directory paths relative to that path, and checks if both exist. It then calls this function twice: once for the current working directory (`.` or `cwd`) and once for the filesystem root (`/`).
