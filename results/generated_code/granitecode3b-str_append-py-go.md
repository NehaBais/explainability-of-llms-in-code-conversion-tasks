Here's the equivalent Golang code:
```
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
 str := "12345678"
 str += "9!"
 fmt.Println(str)
}
``` 
The output of this code will be: `123456789!`
Note that in Golang, the `+=` operator is used to concatenate strings instead of using the `+` operator. Also, note that there are no semicolons (`;`) at the end of the code in Golang.
