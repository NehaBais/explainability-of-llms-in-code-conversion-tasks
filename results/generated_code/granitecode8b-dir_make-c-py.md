Here's a Python implementation of the code you provided:
```python
import os
def mkdir_p(path):
 try:
  os.makedirs(path)
 except OSError as e:
  if e.errno != os.errno.EEXIST or not os.path.isdir(path):
   raise
```
This function takes a single path string as an argument and creates the directory (and any missing parents) if it does not already exist. If the directory already exists, it returns successfully without doing anything.
The `os.makedirs()` function is used to create the directory, and a try-except block is used to handle any errors that may occur. If the error is not due to the directory already existing or if the path is not a directory, the original error message will be raised. This ensures that the function behaves as expected in both normal and error conditions.
