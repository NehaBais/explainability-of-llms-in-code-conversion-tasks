In Python there is no built-in function for bitwise rotate left (rol) and rotate right (ror) like in Java. To implement that you can use slicing to perform the rotation:

```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    print("a AND b:", a & b)
    print("a OR b:", a | b)
    print("a XOR b:", a ^ b)
    print("NOT a:", ~a) # This may cause overflow issue if the result is not within the range of int.
    print("a << b:", a << b)  # left shift
    print("a >> b:", a // 2**b)  # arithmetic right shift
    print("a rol b:", (a << b | a >> (32 - b)))  # rotate left
    print("a ror:", (a >> b | a << (32 - b)))  # rotate right
```
Note: This assumes that the integer is 32-bit. The bitwise rotate left and right operations are not built in in Python so they have to be manually implemented using shift operation. Also note that logical right shift isn't needed here because it behaves the same as arithmetic right shift in this context, since the value we're shifting won't be negative. 

Please also note bitwise NOT may cause overflow issue if the result is not within the range of int, you might want to add a check for that depending on your specific requirement.
