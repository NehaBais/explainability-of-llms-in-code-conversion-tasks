Here's the JavaScript equivalent of your C++ code:

```javascript
function print_logic(a, b) {
    console.log("a and b is " + (a && b));
    console.log("a or b is " + (a || b));
    console.log("not a is " + (!a));
}
```
You can call this function with two boolean values like this: `print_logic(true, false);` and it will print the results of the logical operations in JavaScript syntax.
