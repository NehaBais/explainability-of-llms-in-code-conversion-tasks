In Python, the os module does not have a direct function equivalent to Rename for files and directories in a different directory (i.e., '/'). However, we can use the shutil module's move() function which is designed to perform such operations, and then specify the old and new paths as strings.

Here is how you would convert your Golang code into Python:
```python
import os
import shutil

# Here
os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
shutil.move("/docs", "/mydocs")

# Filesystem root
os.rename("/root/input.txt", "/root/output.txt")  # Update '/root' to the correct path of your filesystem root if it isn't already
shutil.move("/root/docs", "/root/mydocs")
```
Please remember that you may need to provide the correct paths to these directories as well as have appropriate permissions. Be careful when performing operations that can modify files or directories on your system, as they can result in unintended data loss if used incorrectly.
