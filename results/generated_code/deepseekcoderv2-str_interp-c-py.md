 Certainly! Here is the equivalent Python code using string interpolation to replace the placeholder with the defined value:

```python
def main():
    # Define the variable that will be used in the interpolated string
    extra = "little"
    
    # Use f-string for interpolation (available in Python 3.6 and later)
    print(f"Mary had a {extra} lamb.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code uses an f-string to insert the value of `extra` into the string "Mary had a {extra} lamb.".
