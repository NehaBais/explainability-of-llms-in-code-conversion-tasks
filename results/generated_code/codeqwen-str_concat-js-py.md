Here's how you can convert that JavaScript code to Python:

Python Code:
```python
s = "hello"
s += " there!"
print(s)
```

In this code, we first declare a variable `s` and assign it the value of "hello". Then, we concatenate another string literal (" there!") to `s`. The result is stored back in `s`, and we then print out the content of `s`. This will output: "hello there!"
