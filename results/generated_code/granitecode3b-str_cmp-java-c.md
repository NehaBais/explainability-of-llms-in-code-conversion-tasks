Here's the C code that accomplishes the same task as the Java code:
```c
#include 
int main()
{
 compare("Hello", "Hello");
 compare("5", "5.0");
 compare("java", "Java");
 compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ");
 compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĵãvá");
 return 0;
}
void compare(char* A, char* B)
{
 if (strcmp(A, B) == 0)
 printf("'%s' and '%s' are lexically equal.\n", A, B);
 else
 printf("'%s' and '%s' are not lexically equal.\n", A, B);

 if (strcmpi(A, B) == 0)
 printf("'%s' and '%s' are case-insensitive lexically equal.\n", A, B);
 else
 printf("'%s' and '%s' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.\n", A, B);

 int result = strcmp(A, B);
 if (result < 0)
 printf("'%s' is lexically before '%s'.\n", A, B);
 else if (result > 0)
 printf("'%s' is lexically after '%s'.\n", A, B);

 result = strcmp(A, B);
 if (result <= 0)
 printf("'%s' is not lexically before '%s'.\n", A, B);
 if (result >= 0)
 printf("'%s' is not lexically after '%s'.\n", A, B);

 printf("The lexical relationship is: %d\n", strcmp(A, B));
 printf("The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: %d\n", strcmpi(A, B));
}
```
In C, the `strcmp()` function is used to compare two strings for exact equality, while the `strcmpi()` function is used to perform a case-insensitive comparison. The `strcmp()` function returns an integer value that indicates the lexical relationship between the two strings: 0 if the strings are equal, a positive value if A is greater than B, and a negative value if A is less than B.
The `strcmpi()` function is similar to `strcmp()`, but it performs a case-insensitive comparison by converting both strings to lowercase before comparing them. The `strcmpi()` function returns the same integer values as `strcmp()`, indicating whether the two strings are equal, greater than, or less than each other.
In addition to these functions, C provides several other string comparison operators and functions that can be used depending on the specific requirements of the program. For example, the `<` operator can be used to compare strings lexically, while the `strcmp()` function can be used to perform a numerical comparison if the two strings contain numeric values.
