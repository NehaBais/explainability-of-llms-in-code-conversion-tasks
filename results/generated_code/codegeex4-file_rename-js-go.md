The equivalent Go code for renaming a file and directory would look like this. The os package in Go provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as moving files or directories.

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)

func renameFiles() {
	var err error
	
	err = os.Rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
	check(err)
	
	err = os.Rename("docs", "mydocs")
	check(err)
}

func renameFilesInRoot() {
	var err error

	root, err := filepath.Abs("/")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	
	err = os.Rename(filepath.Join(root, "input.txt"), filepath.Join(root, "output.txt"))
	check(err)
	
	err = os.Rename(filepath.Join(root, "docs"), filepath.Join(root, "mydocs"))
	check(err)
}

func check(e error) {
	if e != nil {
		log.Fatal(e)
	}
}

func main() {
	renameFiles()
	renameFilesInRoot()
}
```
This code first renames the file and directory in the current working directory. After that, it moves them to the root directory.

**Note:** 

- Please ensure you have permission to rename files and directories in both your current working directory and the root directory.
- This program does not handle cases where the destination already exists. You may need to add additional logic to handle those scenarios according to your requirements.
- It's not recommended to run this program as a normal user due to security concerns, especially when renaming in the filesystem root.
