 To convert the given JavaScript code to Rust, we need to ensure that all bitwise operations are supported in Rust. Here's how you can write a routine in Rust to perform the same operations:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 0b1010; // Example value for 'a'
    let b = 0b1100; // Example value for 'b'

    println!("a AND b: {}", a & b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a | b);
    println!("a XOR b: {}", a ^ b);
    println!("NOT a: {:08b}", !a); // Assuming 8-bit representation for NOT operation
    println!("a << b: {}", a << (b & 0x1F)); // Left shift, mask b to fit within 32 bits
    println!("a >> b: {}", a >> (b & 0x1F)); // Arithmetic right shift, mask b to fit within 32 bits
    println!("a >>> b: {:08b}", a as u32 << (32 - (b & 0x1F)) | a >> (b & 0x1F)); // Logical right shift, assuming 8-bit representation for output
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: `a & b` in Rust performs the bitwise AND operation on integers `a` and `b`.
2. **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: `a | b` in Rust performs the bitwise OR operation on integers `a` and `b`.
3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: `a ^ b` in Rust performs the bitwise XOR operation on integers `a` and `b`.
4. **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**: In Rust, the `!` operator is used for the bitwise NOT operation. Since it returns a signed integer, we need to ensure that the result fits within 8 bits using {:08b} format specifier for display.
5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**: `a << (b & 0x1F)` performs the left shift on `a` by the number of positions specified in `b`, masked to fit within 32 bits.
6. **Right Shift (`>>`)**: In Rust, the right arithmetic shift is performed using `a >> (b & 0x1F)`. This ensures that the shift amount does not exceed the bit width.
7. **Logical Right Shift (`>>>`)**: To simulate a logical right shift in Rust, we can use a combination of left and right shifts to achieve the same effect as JavaScript's `>>>` operator. However, since Rust does not have a direct equivalent for logical right shift without sign extension, we display the result using an 8-bit representation for clarity.

This Rust code performs all the bitwise operations specified in your original JavaScript function and includes comments to explain each operation.
