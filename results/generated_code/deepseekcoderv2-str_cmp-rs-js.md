 Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the provided Rust code, demonstrating the same functionalities:

```javascript
// only same types can be compared
// String and String or &str and &str
// exception: strict equality and inequality also work on &str and String
let a = "abc";
let b = "Bac".toString(); // JavaScript strings are inherently comparable without conversion

if (a === b) { console.log("The strings are equal"); }
if (a !== b) { console.log("The strings are not equal"); }
if (a > b) { console.log("The first string is lexically after the second"); }
if (a < b) { console.log("The first string is lexically before the second"); }
if (a >= b) { console.log("The first string is not lexically before the second"); }
if (a <= b) { console.log("The first string is not lexically after the second"); }

// case-insensitives:

// equality
if (a.toLowerCase() === b.toLowerCase()) { console.log("Both strings are equal when ignoring case"); }

// everything else, create owned Strings, then compare as above
let a2 = a.toUpperCase();
let b2 = b.toUpperCase();

// repeat checks
```

### Explanation:
1. **Comparing two strings for exact equality**: The `===` operator is used in JavaScript to check strict equality between strings and values.
2. **Comparing two strings for inequality**: The `!==` operator is used to check for inequality.
3. **Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before the other**: The `<` and `>` operators are used for lexical comparison in JavaScript, where uppercase letters come before lowercase letters.
4. **Case-insensitives comparisons**: The `.toLowerCase()` method is used to convert both strings to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures case-insensitive equality.
5. **Handling numeric strings**: In JavaScript, if you have numeric strings that should be treated lexically, they will naturally compare based on their numerical value unless explicitly converted to a different type (e.g., using `Number()`). However, for lexical comparison in the general sense without converting types, the above methods suffice.

This conversion maintains the functionality of comparing strings as demonstrated in the Rust code while adapting it to JavaScript's syntax and built-in functions.
