The provided Python code is to rename a file called input.txt into output.txt and a directory called docs into mydocs. However, in C++, these tasks are not directly supported as it is typical for the operating system functions to be language agnostic. The typical approach would be to change both paths (file & directory) at once using `rename()` function provided by C++'s <cstdio> library.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    const char old_name[] = "input.txt";
    const char new_name[] = "output.txt";
    rename(old_name, new_name); 

    char *dir_name = "docs";
    if (rename(dir_name, "mydocs") == -1){ // -1 is returned if the directories don't exist or could not be renamed
        // handle error appropriately here
    }
  
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that you need to link against <cstdio> and provide appropriate library in your compiler settings.
