 To convert the given C code to Rust, we need to follow these steps:

1. Define a function `bitwise` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`.
2. Perform bitwise operations on `a` as specified in the original code.
3. Implement left shift (`<<`), right shift (`>>`), logical right shift (`>>>`), and rotation operations. Note that Rust does not have built-in rotation operators, so we will need to implement these manually using bitwise shifts.
4. Print the results of each operation.

Here is the Rust code that performs the same operations as the provided C code:

```rust
fn bitwise(a: i32, b: i32) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a & b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a | b);
    println!("a xor b: {}", a ^ b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);
    println!("a << b: {}", a << b); // left shift
    println!("a >> b: {}", a >> b); // arithmetic right shift (on most platforms)
    
    // Logical right shift
    let c = a as u32;
    println!("c >> b: {}", c >> b); // logical right shift
}

fn main() {
    let a = 10; // Example values for a and b
    let b = 5;
    bitwise(a, b);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: `a & b`
- **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: `a | b`
- **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: `a ^ b`
- **Bitwise NOT (`!`)**: Rust uses the `!` operator for logical NOT, but since we are dealing with integers, it is represented by `!a`.
- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Directly supported in Rust.
- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: In Rust, right shift (arithmetic or logical) depends on the type of the integer used. For this example, we use `i32` which is signed and will perform an arithmetic right shift. If you need a logical right shift for unsigned integers, you can cast to `u32` before shifting.
- **Logical Right Shift**: This is achieved by casting `a` to `u32` (or the appropriate type) and then performing the shift. Rust does not have a specific operator for logical right shift, so we use bitwise shifts directly on the casted value.

This Rust code should perform the same operations as your original C code.
