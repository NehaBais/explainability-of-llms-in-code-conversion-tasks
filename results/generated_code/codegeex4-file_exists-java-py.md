In Python, you can use the `os` module to perform similar functionality. Here is how you could convert the given Java code:

```python
import os

# For current working directory
if os.path.exists('docs') and os.path.isfile('docs/input.txt'):
    print("The file and directory exist in the current working directory.")
else:
    print("The file or directory does not exist in the current working directory.")

# For filesystem root
root_dir = '/'

if os.path.exists(os.path.join(root_dir, 'docs')) and os.path.isfile(os.path.join(root_dir, 'docs/input.txt')):
    print("The file and directory exist in the filesystem root.")
else:
    print("The file or directory does not exist in the filesystem root.")
```

This Python script first imports the `os` module, which provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality. Then it checks for the existence of a file and directory inside 'docs' folder for both current working directory and the root of the filesystem by constructing the full path with os.path.join(). If either does not exist, it prints an appropriate message.
