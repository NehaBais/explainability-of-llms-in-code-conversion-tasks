 Here's the conversion of the Rust code to JavaScript:

```javascript
let hello = "Hello world";
hello += "!!!!";
console.log(hello);
```

In this JavaScript code, we first create a string variable `hello` with the initial value "Hello world". Then, we append the string literal "!!!!" to it using the assignment operator `+=`. Finally, we print the contents of the variable `hello` to the console.
