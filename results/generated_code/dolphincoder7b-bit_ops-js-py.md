This is a JavaScript function that performs bitwise operations on two integers. We will convert this to Python code and modify it to match the parameters and results expected by the JavaScript version.

Here's the modified Python code:
```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    # Perform AND operation
    and_result = a & b
    print("a AND b:", and_result)

    # Perform OR operation
    or_result = a | b
    print("a OR b:", or_result)

    # Perform XOR operation
    xor_result = a ^ b
    print("a XOR b:", xor_result)

    # Perform NOT operation
    not_result = ~a
    print("NOT a:", not_result)

    # Perform left shift operation
    left_shift = a << b
    print("a  << b:", left_shift)

    # Perform right arithmetic shift operation
    right_arithmetic_shift = a >> b
    print("a  >> b:", right_arithmetic_shift)

    # Perform right logical shift operation
    right_logical_shift = a >>> b
    print("a  >>> b:", right_logical_shift)

bitwise(10, 20)
```
This will perform the bitwise operations on integers `10` and `20`, and the results will be printed out.
