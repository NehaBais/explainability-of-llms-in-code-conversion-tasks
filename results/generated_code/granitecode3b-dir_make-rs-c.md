Here's the equivalent C code for creating a directory and any missing parents, using the mkdir function from the dirent library:
```
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 char *path = "./path/to/dir";
 if (mkdir(path, S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH) == -1 && errno != EEXIST) {
 perror("Error creating directory");
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 }
 return 0;
}
```
In this code, we first include the dirent library and then define a main function. We then declare a char pointer to store the path to the directory we want to create. We use the mkdir function from the dirent library to create the directory. The S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH bitmask is used to set the permissions of the newly created directory to allow reading, writing, and execution for the owner, group, and others.
If the mkdir function returns an error other than EEXIST (which indicates that the directory already exists), we call perror to print the error message and exit with a failure status of EXIT_FAILURE. Otherwise, if no error is returned, we return 0 to indicate success.
