Here is the Python code that meets the requirements:
```python
import os
def rename_file(oldname, newname):
 try:
 # Rename file (or directory)
 os.rename(oldname, newname)
 return True
 except OSError as e:
 print(f"Error renaming {oldname}: {e}")
 return False
# Test the function
test_data = [("file", "input.txt", "output.txt"),
 ("file", os.sep + "input.txt", os.sep + "output.txt"),
 ("directory", "docs", "mydocs"),
 ("directory", os.sep + "docs" + os.sep, os.sep + "mydocs" + os.sep)]
for test_type, oldname, newname in test_data:
 print(f"Testing {test_type} rename:")
 if not rename_file(oldname, newname):
 print(f"{oldname} could not be renamed into {newname}.")
```
This Python code uses the `os` module to perform file and directory operations. The `rename_file` function takes two arguments: the old name and the new name. It attempts to rename the file or directory using the `os.rename()` method. If the renaming is successful, it returns True; otherwise, it prints an error message and returns False.
The test data includes different types of files and directories, as well as absolute and relative paths. The code iterates over the test data and calls the `rename_file` function for each entry. If the renaming fails, the code prints an error message indicating that the renaming was unsuccessful.
