The JavaScript code provided in the question is using ActiveXObject which is Microsoft's proprietary way of extending the client-side scripting language to other products developed by Microsoft.

C++ doesn't natively support operations like renaming/moving files or directories, as it lacks built-in file system libraries like `fso` in JavaScript.

To achieve the functionality you require in C++, you would need to use some sort of library for interacting with the file system, such as Boost Filesystem (https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/filesystem/doc/index.html) or standard C++17 filesystem libraries (http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4885.pdf).

Here is an example of how you might accomplish this using the Boost Filesystem library:
```cpp
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>
namespace fs = boost::filesystem;

int main() {
    // Move input.txt to output.txt
    fs::path sourceFile("input.txt");
    fs::path destFile("output.txt");
    fs::rename(sourceFile, destFile);

    // Move c:/docs to c:/mydocs
    fs::path sourceFolder("c:/docs");
    fs::path destFolder("c:/mydocs");
    fs::rename(sourceFolder, destFolder);

    return 0;
}
```
This code uses the Boost Filesystem library (https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/filesystem/doc/index.html) to interact with the file system. The `fs::rename` function is used to rename files and directories.

Note that this code assumes that you have the Boost Filesystem library installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download and install it from https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/filesystem/doc/index.html.
