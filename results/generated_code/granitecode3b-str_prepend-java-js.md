Here's the equivalent JavaScript code:
```
let string = "abc";
string = "def" + string;
``` 
Note that in JavaScript, you don't need to declare a variable type when assigning a value to it. Also, unlike Java, JavaScript does not have automatic type casting like in some other languages. Therefore, the `+` operator will concatenate the two strings and return a new string as the result.
