Sure, the equivalent Python code would be as follows:
```python
def logic(a, b):
    print(f"a AND b: {int(a and b)}")  # In python "and" returns True only if both sides are true.
    print(f"a OR b: {int(a or b)}")  # In Python "or" returns True if either of the sides are true.
    print(f"NOT a: {int(not a)}") # "!" in python is equivalent to "not" keyword in java.
```
Please note that Python uses boolean values (True and False), not integers for logical comparison operations. Therefore, I've converted the boolean arguments to integer equivalents before performing the operations.
