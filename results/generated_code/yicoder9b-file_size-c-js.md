In JavaScript, you can use the `fs` module to perform file system operations like checking the size of a file. Here's how you would implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

try {
  // Checking the size of 'input.txt' in current working directory
  let stats = fs.statSync('input.txt');
  console.log(stats.size);

  // Checking the size of '/input.txt' in file system root 
  stats = fs.statSync('/input.txt');
  console.log(stats.size);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
}
```

This JavaScript version uses `fs.statSync` to get the file stats, just like the C version uses `stat`. The difference is that you don't need a `struct stat` because in Javascript you can directly access properties on the returned object (`stats.size`). Also note that unlike C, JavaScript does not support absolute paths starting with `/` for relative paths. So '/input.txt' refers to root of file system rather than root of current directory or web host.

If you want this to work in a Node.js environment where the path is relative to the current working directory, use './input.txt' instead of just 'input.txt'. If you want absolute paths, use `__dirname` variable which holds the directory name of the JavaScript file being executed.
