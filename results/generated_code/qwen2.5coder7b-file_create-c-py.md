Sure, here is the equivalent Python code that performs the same task as the provided C code:

```python
import os

# Create an empty file called "output.txt" in the current working directory
with open("output.txt", 'w') as f:
    pass  # This line does nothing but creates a new empty file

# Create an empty directory called "docs" in the current working directory
os.mkdir("docs")

# Change the working directory to the filesystem root (requires appropriate permissions)
os.chdir('/')

# Create an empty file called "output.txt" in the filesystem root
with open("/output.txt", 'w') as f:
    pass  # This line does nothing but creates a new empty file

# Create an empty directory called "docs" in the filesystem root
os.mkdir("/docs")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Creating an Empty File:**
   - In Python, creating an empty file is done by opening it in write mode (`'w'`). If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If it does exist, its contents will be truncated (empty).
   
2. **Creating an Empty Directory:**
   - The `os.mkdir` function is used to create a new directory.

3. **Changing the Working Directory:**
   - `os.chdir('/')` changes the working directory to the filesystem root (`/`). Note that this requires appropriate permissions to access the root directory.

### Important Notes:
- Running the code as presented will require root privileges because it attempts to write and create files in the filesystem root.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform these operations, especially when dealing with the root directory.
- The Python code assumes a Unix-like environment since the C code uses specific POSIX functions.
