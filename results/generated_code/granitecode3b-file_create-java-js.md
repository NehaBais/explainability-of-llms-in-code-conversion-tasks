Here's the JavaScript code that accomplishes the same task:
```
const fs = require('fs');
// Create an empty file in the current working directory and in the root directory
fs.writeFileSync('output.txt', '');
fs.mkdirSync('/output.txt');
fs.mkdirSync('/');
```
This code uses the `fs` module from Node.js to create a new file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes in both the current working directory and the root directory. The `writeFileSync` method creates an empty file, while the `mkdirSync` method creates a new directory.
