 Below is how you can achieve this in Go:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func checkFileAndDirectoryExistence() {
    // Checking for a file and a directory in the current working directory.
    if _, err := os.Stat("docs/input.txt"); err == nil {
        fmt.Println("The file exists.")
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("The file does not exist: %v\n", err)
    }
    
    // Checking for a file and a directory in the filesystem root.
    if _, err := os.Stat("/docs/input.txt"); err == nil {
        fmt.Println("The file exists.")
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("The file does not exist: %v\n", err)
    }
}

func main() {
    checkFileAndDirectoryExistence()
}
```
In this Go code, we use `os.Stat` function to get information about a file or directory. If the file/directory exists, the function returns no error and we print that it exists. If there is an error (like file/directory does not exist), we print the error message.

Note: In Go, `new File()` is not used as it is done in Java. Instead, you use packages like `os` or `path/filepath`. 

Also, in Golang, there is no need to check if a directory exists; you can just create one and Golang will take care of that for you. If the parent directories do not exist, Golang creates them for you.
