 Certainly! Below is the Python code that performs the same string interpolation as your Java code:

```python
adjective = "little"
lyric = f"Mary had a {adjective} lamb"
print(lyric)
```

In this Python code, we define the `adjective` variable and then use an f-string to interpolate it into the `lyric` string. The result is printed out using the `print()` function.
