This code converts a vector of strings to a single string by using the accumulate function. The accumulate function combines all the elements of a range into a single value, in this case a string.

Here is the JavaScript equivalent:

```
let myStrings = ["prepended to", "my string"];
let prepended = myStrings.reduce((a, b) => a + b, '');
console.log(prepended);
```
Note that reduce() is similar to accumulate(), but it is part of the JavaScript Array prototype and returns a single value, whereas accumulate() returns a new string object.
