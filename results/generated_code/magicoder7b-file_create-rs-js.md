 In JavaScript, you can use the `fs` module to interact with file systems. Here is how you could replicate the Rust functionality in JavaScript:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Function to create a directory and write to a new file
async function create(root) {
    const fPath = path.join(root, 'output.txt');
    const dPath = path.join(root, 'docs');

    try {
        fs.promises.mkdir(dPath, { recursive: true });
        fs.promises.writeFile(fPath, '');

        console.log(`Directory created at ${dPath}`);
        console.log(`File created at ${fPath}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('An error occurred while creating the file or directory:', error);
        process.exit(1); // Exit with an error status code
    }
}

// Call the function twice: once for "here" and once for "/"
create('.').then(() => {
    create('/');
});
```

In JavaScript, you have to use `fs.promises` instead of `std::io`. Also, error handling in JavaScript is done with promises (by calling `.catch()` on the promise). The recursive option in `mkdir` ensures that all parent directories are created if they do not exist already.
