Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your C program:

```JavaScript
let extra = "little";
console.log(`Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`);
```

In this JavaScript code, we use backticks (`) to define a string in which we can include other variables or expressions inside ${}. This is known as template literals or string interpolation.
