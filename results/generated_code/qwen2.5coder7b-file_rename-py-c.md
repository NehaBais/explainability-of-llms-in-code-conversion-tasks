Sure, here is the equivalent code in C. Note that error handling for directory and file renaming operations is included as well.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void rename_file(const char *old_name, const char *new_name) {
    if (rename(old_name, new_name) != 0) {
        perror("Error renaming file");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Here in the current working directory
    rename_file("input.txt", "output.txt");
    rename_file("docs", "mydocs");

    // In the filesystem root
    char *root_path = "/";  // Note: You need appropriate permissions to perform this on a filesystem root.
    rename_file(strcat(root_path, "input.txt"), strcat(root_path, "output.txt"));
    rename_file(strcat(root_path, "docs"), strcat(root_path, "mydocs"));

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Remember:
1. Ensure the application has sufficient permissions to read and write in both locations.
2. The root directory ("/") requires elevated privileges on many operating systems and may not work without special handling (like using `sudo` or similar commands in Unix-based systems).

This code will rename "input.txt" and "docs" to "output.txt" and "mydocs", respectively, both in the current working directory and the filesystem root.
