Here is the equivalent C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    const std::string extra = "big";
    std::cout << "Mary had a " << extra << " lamb.\n";
    return 0;
}
```
This C++ code is very similar to the original C code. It includes the necessary headers for input/output and string manipulation, and uses `std::string` instead of `const char*` for string variables. The rest of the code remains largely unchanged.
