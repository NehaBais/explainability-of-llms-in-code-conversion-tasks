In JavaScript, the `fs` module provides methods to interact with the filesystem. Below is a JavaScript version of the Java code:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function renameFile(oldname, newname) {
    try {
        fs.renameSync(oldname, newname);
        return true;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error renaming ${oldname} to ${newname}:`, error.message);
        return false;
    }
}

function test(type, oldname, newname) {
    const success = renameFile(oldname, newname);
    console.log(`The following ${type} called ${oldname}${success ? ' was renamed as' : ' could not be renamed into'} ${newname}.`);
}

function main() {
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
    test("file", path.sep + "input.txt", path.sep + "output.txt");

    if (!fs.existsSync('docs')) {
        fs.mkdirSync('docs');
    }
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs");
    
    if (process.platform !== 'win32') {  // root directory only on Unix-like systems
        test("directory", path.sep + "docs" + path.sep, path.sep + "mydocs" + path.sep);
    }
}

main();
```

Please note:

1. To use `fs.renameSync` method in Node.js, it's necessary to handle the possible exceptions.
2. On Windows, you can't rename or move files to the root directory (`\`) because of permissions issues. So, the last test for directories will be skipped on Windows systems. If you're using a Unix-like system like macOS or Linux, you can run all tests.

3. The `path.sep` is used to get the platform-specific path separator (i.e., "/" for UNIX-based systems and "\" for Windows).

4. For renaming directories, it's necessary to create the 'docs' directory if it doesn't exist before testing the directory rename operation.
