In JavaScript, you can create a string variable equal to any text value as follows:

```javascript
let s = "hello";
console.log(s);
let s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```

This will output:

hello
helloworld literal

In this code `s` is assigned the string `"hello"`, and `s2` is created by concatenating `s` with the string `"literal"`. The `console.log()` function is used to print the values of `s` and `s2` to the console.
