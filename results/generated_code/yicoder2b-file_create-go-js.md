The provided Golang code creates a new file and directory with the given names in the current working directory and filesystem root respectively. However, since JavaScript doesn't have the same filesystem access capabilities as Golang, we can't create these files directly like this in JS. 

A way to achieve similar effect in JavaScript is by using Node.js runtime which provides the filesystem interfaces that correspond with those provided by Go. Below is how you would accomplish the task:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Creating file in current working directory
try {
    fs.openSync('input.txt', 'w');
    console.log("File created!");
} catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error creating file ${err}`);
}

// Creating file at root directory 
try {
    fs.openSync('/output.txt', 'w');
    console.log("File created!");
} catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error creating file ${err}`);
}

// Creating directory in current working directory
try {
    fs.mkdirSync('docs');
    console.log("Directory created!");
} catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error creating directory ${err}`);
}

// Creating directory at root directory 
try {
    fs.mkdirSync('/docs1', {recursive: true});
    console.log("Directory created!");
} catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error creating directory ${err}`);
}
```
This JavaScript code also prints the message of success when it successfully creates a file or directory. If there is any error during creation, it will be caught and an error message printed to console. Note that '/' before filenames indicates they are at root level whereas 'input.txt' or "docs" does not have any path. For "/output.txt" and "/docs1/" we have added {recursive: true} option to make sure the directory is created even if it doesn't exist yet.
