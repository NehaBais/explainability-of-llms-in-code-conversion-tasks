Here's the Python code that demonstrates how to compare two strings:
```python
c = "cat"
d = "dog"
if c == d:
 print(c, "is bytewise identical to", d)
if c != d:
 print(c, "is bytewise different from", d)
if c > d:
 print(c, "is lexically bytewise greater than", d)
if c < d:
 print(c, "is lexically bytewise less than", d)
if c >= d:
 print(c, "is lexically bytewise greater than or equal to", d)
if c <= d:
 print(c, "is lexically bytewise less than or equal to", d)
import strings
eqf = 'when interpreted as UTF-8 and compared under Unicode simple case folding rules.'
if strings.EqualFold(c, d):
 print(c, "equal to", d, eqf)
else:
 print(c, "not equal to", d, eqf)
```
This code compares the strings "cat" and "dog" using various comparison operators. It also demonstrates how to perform a case-insensitive comparison using the `strings.EqualFold()` function. The code uses Python's built-in string comparison operators and the `strings` module in Python to achieve this functionality.
