Here's the converted code from C to JavaScript that renames a file and directory, as well as renaming them in the filesystem root:
```
const fs = require('fs');
// Rename a file and directory in the current working directory
function renameFileAndDirectory() {
 try {
 // Rename input.txt into output.txt
 fs.renameSync('input.txt', 'output.txt');
 // Rename docs into mydocs
 fs.renameSync('docs', 'mydocs');
 console.log("Renamed files and directories successfully.");
 } catch (err) {
 console.error("Error renaming files and directories:", err);
 }
}
// Rename a file and directory in the filesystem root
function renameFileAndDirectoryRoot() {
 try {
 // Rename /input.txt into /output.txt
 fs.renameSync('/input.txt', '/output.txt');
 // Rename /docs into /mydocs
 fs.renameSync('/docs', '/mydocs');
 console.log("Renamed files and directories successfully.");
 } catch (err) {
 console.error("Error renaming files and directories:", err);
 }
}
// Call the functions to rename the files and directories
renameFileAndDirectory();
renameFileAndDirectoryRoot();
```
Note: This code assumes that Node.js is installed on the system, and that the user has the necessary permissions to rename files and directories in the current working directory and in the filesystem root.
