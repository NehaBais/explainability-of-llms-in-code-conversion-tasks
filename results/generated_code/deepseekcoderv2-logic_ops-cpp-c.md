The code will be called as follows:
```
print_logic(true, true);
print_logic(false, false);
```

## Instructions

1. Create a file called `main.cpp` in the same folder where you put your `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`.
2. Copy and paste the code from above into main.cpp.
3. Build with `ctrl+shift+B` or by pressing the "Build Project" button in the bottom left corner of VSCode, which will be under a cog-wheel icon. (You can also build by right clicking on main.cpp and selecting "Build").
4. Run your program using Debug > Start Debugging. This should run `main.exe`. You could also run it from the command line with `./build/main`.
5. In case you have issues, check for typos: especially pay attention to the braces that must be at the same level of indentation as they appear in the code above - if your IDE is not smart enough to indent them correctly, copy paste and adjust until it looks good (or just use an editor such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) where syntax highlighting works much better).
6. If you are having trouble with building or running the program, please ask your instructor for help.
