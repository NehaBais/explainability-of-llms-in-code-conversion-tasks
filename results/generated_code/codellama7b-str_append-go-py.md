Here's the equivalent code in Python:
```
import textwrap

def main():
    s = "foo"
    s += "bar"
    print(s)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Explanation:

In Go, the `strings.Builder` type is used to create a string variable that can be appended with other string literals in an efficient manner. In Python, we can achieve the same result using a simple concatenation operator (`+=`) on a string variable.

The code first declares a variable `s` of type `strings.Builder`, and then uses the `WriteString()` method to append the string literal `"foo"` to it. The next line appends the string literal `"bar"` to `s`. Finally, the contents of `s` are printed using the `fmt.Print()` function.

In Python, we can achieve a similar result by simply declaring a variable `s` as a string and then concatenating it with another string using the `+=` operator. The resulting value is then printed using the built-in `print()` function.
