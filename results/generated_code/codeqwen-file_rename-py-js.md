In JavaScript, the `fs` module provides file system operations such as rename(). Here is how you can use it to perform the operations:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Rename a file in the current directory and the root directory.
fs.renameSync('./input.txt', './output.txt');
fs.renameSync('/input.txt', '/output.txt');

// Rename a directory in the current directory and the root directory.
fs.renameSync('./docs', './mydocs');
fs.renameSync('/docs', '/mydocs');
```

Note that `require('fs')` is used to import the Node.js File System (fs) module which provides a way of interacting with the file system in Node.js.

Also, `path.sep` provides the appropriate directory separator for the operating system running on. So it helps in dealing with paths that contain special characters or spaces that are not supported by some versions of Windows.
