Here's how you can convert the given Golang code to JavaScript:

```javascript
function printLogic(a, b) {
    console.log("a and b is " + (a && b));
    console.log("a or b is " + (a || b));
    console.log("not a is " + !a);
}
```

In this JavaScript function `printLogic`, we are performing the same operations as in your Golang code using JavaScript's logical operators (`&&` for AND, `||` for OR, and `!` for NOT). The results of these operations are then printed to the console.
