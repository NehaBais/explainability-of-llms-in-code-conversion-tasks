Sure, here's how you can do this in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main() {
    std::string s = "hello";
    std::cout << (s + " there!") << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This will output: `hello there!`. The concatenation operation is done using the '+' operator in C++, similar to how it's being used in JavaScript.
