This code compares two strings using the `equals()` and `compareTo()` methods in Java. Here's how you can convert this code to C++:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    string A = "Hello";
    string B = "Hello";
    cout << "'A' and 'B' are lexically equal." << endl;

    if (A.compare(B) == 0) {
        cout << "'A' and 'B' are case-insensitive lexically equal." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "'A' and 'B' are not case-insensitive lexically equal." << endl;
    }

    if (A.compare(B) < 0) {
        cout << "'A' is lexically before 'B'." << endl;
    } else if (A.compare(B) > 0) {
        cout << "'A' is lexically after 'B'." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "'A' is not lexically before or after 'B'." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
In C++, we use the `string` class instead of the `String` class in Java. The `compare()` method in C++ compares two strings and returns an integer value indicating their relationship, where a negative value means that one string is lexically before another, a positive value means that one string is lexically after another, and 0 means they are equal.
The code above uses the `cout` function to print output to the console. In C++, we use the `<<` operator to concatenate strings and integers.
In C++, we can also use the `std::string` class instead of the `String` class in Java.
