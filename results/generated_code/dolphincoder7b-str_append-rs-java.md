This is a simplified version of the Rust code:

String hello = "Hello world";
hello += "!!!!"; // append the string literal to 'hello'
System.out.println(hello); // print the result

In this Java code, we simply declare a String variable 'hello', initialize it with the value "Hello world", then concatenate another string ("!!!!") to it using the '+' operator and store it in the same variable. The final line prints the content of 'hello' to the console. 

Note: In Rust, you would use the `add` method on a String object instead of concatenating with the '+' operator. However, this is not possible directly in Java as there is no built-in equivalent to the `Add` trait (which defines the '+' operator behavior for types that implement it). Therefore, we need to concatenate the strings using the '+' operator as shown above in order to replicate the Rust code behavior.
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String hello = "Hello world";
        hello += "!!!!"; // append the string literal to 'hello'
        System.out.println(hello); // print the result
    }
}
```
