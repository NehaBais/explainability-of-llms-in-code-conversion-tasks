This code will need to be modified to work with C++, since Rust requires an input stream and does not have an equivalent in C++. For the purposes of this conversion, we can use `cin` from `<iostream>` instead. Here is the updated C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a, b;
    cout << "Enter two integers: ";
    cin >> a >> b;
    if (a < b) {
        cout << a << " is less than " << b << endl;
    } else if (a == b) {
        cout << a << " equals " << b << endl;
    } else if (a > b) {
        cout << a << " is greater than " << b << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this updated version, we get the input for both integers using `cin` from `<iostream>`, which takes in input from the console or standard input. We use `cout` to display the results of the comparison. The condition is checked with `if`, `else if`, and `else`.
