Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your Java program:

```JavaScript
let string = "abc";
console.log(string);
string += "def";
console.log(string);
```
This will print out "abc" followed by "abcdef", because in JavaScript, appending to a string variable is done using the '+=' operator, much like it was in Java. The console.log function also works similarly to System.out.println.
