In C language, the file operations and directory creation are done with functions available in standard libraries like `fopen` for file handling and `mkdir` for creating a directory. However, there's no direct equivalent to `std::filesystem::create_directory()` in C++. For creating directories we may have to use system commands or write platform-specific code which is beyond the scope of this assistant.

Here's an approximate equivalent conversion:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *f = fopen("output.txt", "w"); 
    if (f == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to create file\n");
        return -1;
    }
    fclose(f);

    // Repeat the same operation for "/output.txt"
    FILE *g = fopen("/output.txt", "w"); 
    if (g == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to create file in root directory\n");
        return -1;
    }
    fclose(g);

   // Unfortunately, C does not have a standard way of creating directories.
   // You would typically use system-specific commands or functions here.
   // For example, on Unix systems like Linux and MacOS you could use system() to run mkdir command:
   //system("mkdir docs"); 
   //system("sudo mkdir /docs");  // for root directory
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that the above code does not cover creating a directory "docs" in the current and filesystem root as C language doesn't provide standard functions to create directories. You would typically use system-specific commands or functions here, which are beyond the scope of this assistant.
