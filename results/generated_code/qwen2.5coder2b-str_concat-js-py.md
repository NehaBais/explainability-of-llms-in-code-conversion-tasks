Sure! Below is the equivalent code in Python:

```python
# Step 1: Create a string variable 's' equal to any text value
s = "hello"

# Step 2: Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal
result = s + " there!"

# Step 3: Print the content of the variables
print("Original Variable (s):", s)
print("Concatenated Result:", result)
```

When you run this code, it will output:


Original Variable (s): hello
Concatenated Result: hello there!
