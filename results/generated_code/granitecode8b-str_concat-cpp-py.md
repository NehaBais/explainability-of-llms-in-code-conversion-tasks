Here is the Python code that meets the requirements:
```
s = "hello"
print(s, "literal")
s2 = s + " literal"
print(s2)
```
The output of this code will be:

hello literal
hell literal

In this code, we first create a string variable `s` and assign it the value `"hello"`. We then print the value of `s` followed by the string literal `"literal"`. Next, we create another string variable `s2` and concatenate the value of `s` with the string literal `"literal"`. Finally, we print the value of `s2`.
