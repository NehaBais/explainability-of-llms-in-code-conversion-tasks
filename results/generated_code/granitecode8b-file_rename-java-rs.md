Here is the Rust code that achieves the same functionality as the given Java code:
```
use std::fs;
use std::io;
fn rename_file(old_name: &str, new_name: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
 fs::rename(old_name, new_name)?;
 Ok(())
}
fn main() {
 let old_name = "input.txt";
 let new_name = "output.txt";
 match rename_file(&old_name, &new_name) {
 Ok(_) => println!("{} was renamed as {}", old_name, new_name),
 Err(e) => eprintln!("Error renaming {}: {}", old_name, e),
 }
 let old_name = "docs";
 let new_name = "mydocs";
 match rename_file(&old_name, &new_name) {
 Ok(_) => println!("{} was renamed as {}", old_name, new_name),
 Err(e) => eprintln!("Error renaming {}: {}", old_name, e),
 }
}
```
This Rust code uses the `std::fs` module to rename files and directories. The `rename_file` function takes two arguments: the old name of the file or directory and the new name. It returns a `Result` type with an `Ok` value if the rename was successful, or an `Err` value if there was an error.
In the `main` function, we define two variables `old_name` and `new_name` that hold the names of the file to be renamed and the new name to give it. We then call the `rename_file` function twice, once for renaming a file and once for renaming a directory.
If the rename is successful, we print a message saying that the file or directory was renamed as expected. If there was an error, we print an error message indicating what went wrong.
