Sure! Here's the equivalent Golang code for your requirements:
```go
func logic(a, b bool) {
  fmt.Println("a AND b:", a && b)
  fmt.Println("a OR b:", a || b)
  fmt.Println("NOT a:", !a)
}
```
Note that in Golang, boolean values are represented using the `bool` type, and logical operators such as "and" (`&&`) and "or" (`||`) return either `true` or `false`. The "not" operator (`!`) returns `true` if its operand is `false`, and `false` if its operand is `true`.
