Here's the Python code that implements the same functionality as the Golang code you provided:
```
def print_logic(a, b):
 print("a and b is", a and b)
 print("a or b is", a or b)
 print("not a is", not a)
```
In Python, logical values are represented using the keywords `True` and `False`. The `and`, `or`, and `not` operators work as expected to perform the desired logic operations on boolean values. The `print` function is used to output the results of the logic operations.
