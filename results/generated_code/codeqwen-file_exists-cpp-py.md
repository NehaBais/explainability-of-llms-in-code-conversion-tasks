The equivalent code in Python is as follows:

```python
import os

def file_exists(path):
    print(path)
    if os.path.exists(path):
        if os.path.isdir(path):
            print(" Is a directory")
        else:
            print(" exists with a file size of ", os.path.getsize(path), " bytes.")
    else:
        print(" does not exist")

file_exists("input.txt")
file_exists("/zero_length.txt")  # if you want to check the root directory, you need to provide an absolute path
file_exists("/docs/input.txt")
file_exists("/docs/zero_length.txt")
```

Please note that in Python, directories are usually referred to using a forward slash ("/"), so if you are running this script on a Unix-based system or any other operating system where "/" is the root directory of the filesystem, you will need to use "/docs/input.txt" and "/docs/zero_length.txt". The Python `os` module provides a function named `path.exists()` which checks whether the specified path exists or not. If the path is an existing regular file, it returns True. If the path does not exist or the user doesnâ€™t have the appropriate permissions to access the path, it raises an exception.
