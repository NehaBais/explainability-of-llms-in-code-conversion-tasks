Here's the JavaScript code that accomplishes the same task as the Golang code you provided:
```javascript
// text assigned to a string variable
let s = 'hello';
// output string variable
console.log(s);
// this output requested by original task description, although
// not really required by current wording of task description.
console.log(s + ' literal');
// concatenate variable and literal, assign result to another string variable
let s2 = s + ' literal';
// output second string variable
console.log(s2);
```
The JavaScript code creates a string variable `s` with the value "hello", outputs its value using `console.log()`, concatenates the variable with the literal string "literal" and assigns the result to another string variable `s2`, and then outputs the value of `s2`. The output will be:

hello
helliteration
helliteration

Note that in JavaScript, strings are enclosed in single quotes ('), unlike Golang where double quotes (") are used. Also, JavaScript uses the `console.log()` function to print the values to the console.
