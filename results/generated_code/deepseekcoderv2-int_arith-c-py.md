 Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for the given C code:

```python
def main():
    # Get two integers from the user
    a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
    b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))
    
    # Display their sum
    print(f"a + b = {a + b}")
    
    # Display their difference
    print(f"a - b = {a - b}")
    
    # Display their product
    print(f"a * b = {a * b}")
    
    # Display their integer quotient (truncates towards zero)
    quotient = a // b
    print(f"a / b (integer quotient) = {quotient}")
    
    # Display their remainder (same sign as the first operand)
    remainder = a % b
    print(f"a % b (remainder, same sign as first operand) = {remainder}")
    
    # Display their exponentiation if supported by Python (e.g., 2 ** 3 for 2^3)
    if b != 0:
        print(f"a ** b (exponentiation) = {a ** b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code will prompt the user to enter two integers, perform the specified operations, and display the results. Note that in Python 3, integer division (`//`) truncates towards negative infinity, which is consistent with C99 for this operation. The remainder operator `%` also follows the same sign as the first operand.
