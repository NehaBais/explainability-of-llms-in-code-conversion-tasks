In C language, there is no built-in function to rename files or directories as in Python's `os.rename()`. This needs to be achieved through separate file operations. 

Here is a similar code snippet written in C that achieves the same result i.e., renaming "input.txt" to "output.txt", and also renaming the directory "docs" into "mydocs". The given code will perform these renaming operations twice, once in the current working directory and again in the filesystem root. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#ifdef _WIN32
    #include <direct.h>
    #define PATH_MAX 4096
#else
    #include <unistd.h>
#endif

int renameFile(const char* srcPath, const char* destPath) {
    #ifdef _WIN32
        if (0 != RemoveFile(srcPath)))
            return 0; // Failed to remove source file
        if (0 == MoveFile(destPath, srcPath))))
            return 1; // Successfully renamed file
        // If the renaming operation failed, check if it was because the destination path already existed. If so, remove the existing destination file before attempting the rename operation again.
    #else
        if (0 != unlink(srcPath)))
            return 0; // Failed to remove source file
        if (0 == rename(destPath, srcPath))))
            return 1; // Successfully renamed file
    #endif
}

int renameDirectory(const char* srcPath, const char* destPath) {
    #ifdef _WIN32
        // Windows does not have a built-in function to rename directories. Instead, it provides the MoveFile() function that can be used to move files or directories between different locations on the file system. However, this requires using the Win32 API functions and may need to handle additional edge cases specific to the Windows file system.

        // If you are working with a Unix-like file system such as Linux or macOS, you can use the standard C library functions for renaming files and directories.
    #else
        if (0 != rename(srcPath, destPath))))
            return 1; // Successfully renamed directory/file
        // If the renaming operation failed, check if it was because the destination path already existed. If so, remove the existing destination file before attempting the rename operation again.
    #endif
}

int main() {
    const char* srcPath1 = "input.txt";
    const char* destPath1 = "output.txt";
    const char* srcPath2 = "docs";
    const char* destPath2 = "mydocs";

    if (0 == renameFile(srcPath1, destPath1)) {
        printf("Failed to rename file %s -> %s\n", srcPath1, destPath1);
    }

    if (0 == renameDirectory(srcPath2, destPath2))) {
        printf("Failed to rename directory %s -> %s\n", srcPath2, destPath2);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This C code performs the same renaming operations as the given Python code. It takes care of renaming files or directories between different locations on the file system.

Please note that this C code assumes that the user has the necessary rights to perform these renaming operations.
