In Python, the equivalent code would look like this:

```python
import os

def print_stat(path):
    try:
        stat = os.stat(path)
        if stat.st_mode & os.S_ISDIR():
            print(f"{path} is a directory")
        else:
            print(f"{path} is a file")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: {path} not found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Print for current working directory
    print_stat("input.txt")
    print_stat("/input.txt")
    print_stat("docs")
    print_stat("/docs")
```

In this Python code, `os.stat(path)` is used to get the file information. Then, based on the return value of `stat.st_mode & os.S_ISDIR()`, it prints whether the path points to a directory or a file.

The try-except block is used for handling cases when the file is not found at the specified path (this can be caused by an incorrect path or permission issues).
