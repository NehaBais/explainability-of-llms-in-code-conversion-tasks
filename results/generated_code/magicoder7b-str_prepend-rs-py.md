 In Python, you can achieve this by using `+` to concatenate strings or the `.join()` method in case of multiple strings, and by using a similar process for prepending strings as done in Rust. Here's how it would look:

```python
s = "World"
prepend_string = "Hello "
s = prepend_string + s
print(s)
```
