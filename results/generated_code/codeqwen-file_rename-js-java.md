Java does not have a built-in support for ActiveX or the Scripting.FileSystemObject, which was used in the JavaScript example. Java's File API is a bit different and lacks some functionalities like MoveFolder and MoveFile that are present in JavaScript's FileSystemObject.

Here is an example of how you can achieve the same functionality using Java's built-in `Files` class:

```java
import java.nio.file.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Here
        Files.move(Paths.get("input.txt"), Paths.get("output.txt"), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
        Files.move(Paths.get("/c:/input.txt"), Paths.get("/c:/output.txt"), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);

        // In root
        Files.move(Paths.get("/input.txt"), Paths.get("/output.txt"), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
        Files.move(Paths.get("/docs"), Paths.get("/mydocs"));
    }
}
```

In this Java code, we use the `Files.move()` method to rename files and directories. We pass in two paths: the source and the destination. The `StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING` option replaces the file if it already exists at the destination. 

Please note that this code might not work as expected on all operating systems because the root directory can vary depending on the system's configuration (for example, on Unix-based systems, the root directory is `/`, while on Windows it could be different). Also note that Java does not have a built-in method to move folders like JavaScript.
