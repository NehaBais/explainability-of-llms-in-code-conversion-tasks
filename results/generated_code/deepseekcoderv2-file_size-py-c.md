 Sure! Below is the equivalent C code to verify the size of a file called `input.txt` in both the current working directory and the root directory of the file system:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    // Check for input.txt in the current working directory
    FILE *file1 = fopen("input.txt", "r");
    if (file1 == NULL) {
        printf("File 'input.txt' not found in the current working directory.\n");
    } else {
        fseek(file1, 0, SEEK_END);
        long size1 = ftell(file1);
        printf("Size of 'input.txt' in the current working directory: %ld bytes\n", size1);
        fclose(file1);
    }

    // Check for input.txt in the root directory
    FILE *file2 = fopen("/input.txt", "r");
    if (file2 == NULL) {
        printf("File 'input.txt' not found in the root directory.\n");
    } else {
        fseek(file2, 0, SEEK_END);
        long size2 = ftell(file2);
        printf("Size of 'input.txt' in the root directory: %ld bytes\n", size2);
        fclose(file2);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This C code does the following:
1. Attempts to open `input.txt` in the current working directory using `fopen("input.txt", "r")`. If it fails, it prints a message indicating that the file was not found in the current working directory. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the size of the file.
2. Attempts to open `input.txt` in the root directory using `fopen("/input.txt", "r")`. If it fails, it prints a message indicating that the file was not found in the root directory. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the size of the file.
