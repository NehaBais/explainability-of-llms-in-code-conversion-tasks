 Sure, here is the equivalent code in Python:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
s = "hello"

# Print the content of the original variable
print(s)

# Concatenate with another string literal and print the result
s2 = s + " literal"
print(s2)
```

This Python code does the same thing as your Java code. It creates a string variable `s` with the value "hello", then prints it, and finally concatenates " literal" to it and prints the new string stored in `s2`.
