Sure! Here's the equivalent Rust code for the given function:
```
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a || b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);
}
```
This code defines a function called `logic` that takes two boolean arguments (`a` and `b`) and outputs the results of "and", "or", and "not" operations on both arguments as well. The `&&` operator represents the "and" operation, while the `||` operator represents the "or" operation. The `!` operator represents the "not" operation, which flips the value of its operand.
