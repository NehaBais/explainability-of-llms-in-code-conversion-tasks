Here is the Java code that verifies the size of a file called input.txt for a file in the current working directory and another one in the file system root:
```java
import java.io.File;
public class FileSize {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 File file1 = new File("input.txt");
 long size1 = file1.length();
 System.out.println(size1);
 
 File file2 = new File("/");
 File inputFile = new File(file2, "input.txt");
 long size2 = inputFile.length();
 System.out.println(size2);
 }
}
```
This code first creates two File objects: one for the current working directory and another for the root file system. It then creates a File object in the root directory with the name "input.txt". Finally, it gets the length of each file using the length() method and prints out the size.
