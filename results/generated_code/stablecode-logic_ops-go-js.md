Here's how you can convert the given Golang code to JavaScript:

```javascript
function printLogic(a, b) {
    console.log("a and b is " + (a && b)));
    console.log("a or b is " + ((a || b))));
    console.log("not a is " + (!a)));
}
```
This JavaScript function performs the same operations as your original Golang code: it takes two boolean values, `a` and `b`, and logs the results of logical AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`) on both arguments.
