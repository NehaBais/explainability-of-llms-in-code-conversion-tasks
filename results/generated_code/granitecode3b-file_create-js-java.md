Here's the Java code that accomplishes the same task as the given JavaScript code:
```java
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
public class FileCreator {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"));
       BufferedWriter rootWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("/output.txt"))) {
   // do nothing, just create the files
  } catch (IOException e) {
   System.err.println("Error creating file: " + e.getMessage());
  }

  try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("docs"));
       BufferedWriter rootWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("/docs"))) {
   // do nothing, just create the directories
  } catch (IOException e) {
   System.err.println("Error creating directory: " + e.getMessage());
  }
 }
}
``` 
This Java code uses the `java.io` package to write an empty file and a directory in both the current working directory ("here") and the filesystem root. The try-with-resources statements ensure that the files and directories are properly closed after use. The catch block handles any IOExceptions that may occur during file creation.
