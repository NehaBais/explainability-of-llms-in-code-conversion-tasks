To convert the given Java code to Golang, we can create a similar approach by using the `fmt` package and the concatenation operator (`+`). Here's an example of how it would look in Go:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    str := "abc"
    fmt.Println(str) // Output: abc
    fmt.Printf("The length of string is %d\n", len(str)) // Output: The length of string is 3

    str = "def" + str
    fmt.Println(str) // Output: defabc
}
```
In this code, we first declare a variable `str` with the value "abc". Then, we print out the length of the string using `fmt.Printf()` and `%d`. After that, we prepend the string variable with another string literal "def" by concatenating the two strings with `+` operator. The updated `str` will then contain "defabc", and this value is printed.
