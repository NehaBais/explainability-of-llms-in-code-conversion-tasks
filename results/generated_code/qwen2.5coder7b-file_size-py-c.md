Sure! Below is the equivalent code in C that verifies the size of the file `input.txt` both in the current working directory and at the file system root.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char *file1 = "input.txt";
    char *file2 = "/input.txt";

    struct stat file_stat1;
    if (stat(file1, &file_stat1) == 0) {
        printf("Size of %s: %ld bytes\n", file1, file_stat1.st_size);
    } else {
        perror("Error getting size of input.txt");
    }

    struct stat file_stat2;
    if (stat(file2, &file_stat2) == 0) {
        printf("Size of %s: %ld bytes\n", file2, file_stat2.st_size);
    } else {
        perror("Error getting size of /input.txt");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `stat` function from the `<sys/stat.h>` library is used to get information about the file. It fills a `struct stat` with details about the file.
- `file_stat1.st_size` contains the size of the file in bytes.
- If `stat` returns 0, it means the file was successfully accessed and its size is printed.
- If `stat` returns a non-zero value, an error occurred (e.g., file does not exist), and the error message is printed using `perror`.

### Compilation:
To compile this code on a Unix-like system, you can use the following command:

gcc -o check_file_size check_file_size.c

Then run the compiled program:

./check_file_size

This will print the sizes of `input.txt` in the current directory and at the root.
