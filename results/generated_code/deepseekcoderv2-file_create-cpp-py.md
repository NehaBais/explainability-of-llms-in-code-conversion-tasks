 Sure, here is the equivalent Python code to achieve the same task as the provided C++ code:

```python
import os

# Create an empty file called "output.txt" in the current working directory
with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    pass

# Create an empty file called "/output.txt" (which will be in the root filesystem)
with open("/output.txt", "w") as f:
    pass

# Create a directory called "docs" in the current working directory
os.makedirs("docs", exist_ok=True)

# Create a directory called "/docs" (which will be in the root filesystem)
os.makedirs("/docs", exist_ok=True)
```

This Python code creates an empty file `output.txt` in both the current working directory and the root filesystem, as well as creating an empty directory `docs` in both locations. The `exist_ok=True` parameter ensures that if the files or directories already exist, no error will be raised.
