Here is the C code that accomplishes the same task as the Golang code:
```c
#include 
#include 

int main() {
    FILE *fp;
    fp = fopen("input.txt", "w");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }
    fclose(fp);
    
    mkdir("docs", S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH);
    mkdir("/docs", S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH);
    
    return 0;
}
```
This code uses the `fopen` function to create a new file called "input.txt" in the current working directory and another file called "input.txt" in the root directory. It then uses the `mkdir` function with the `S_IRWXU`, `S_IRWXG`, `S_IROTH`, and `S_IXOTH` flags to create a directory called "docs" in both the current working directory and the root directory, and sets its permissions accordingly using the `S_IRWXU`, `S_IRWXG`, `S_IROTH`, and `S_IXOTH` flags.
