The Python code is not directly compatible with C because it's built on Python and cannot be run as a standalone script in C. However, the required checks can be converted to C using the `access` function from the `unistd.h` library:

#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    if (access("input.txt", F_OK) != 0 || access("/input.txt", F_OK) != 0) {
        printf("File does not exist!\n");
        return -1;
    }

    if (access("docs", F_OK) != 0 || access("/docs", F_OK) != 0) {
        printf("Directory does not exist!\n");
        return -2;
    }
}

In this code, `access` is used to check whether a file or directory exists and if it can be accessed by the current user. The `F_OK` flag indicates that no mode checking should be done: only existence of the file or directory is checked. If the file does not exist or cannot be accessed (i.e., permission issue), the error message is printed to the standard output and the program returns a non-zero value.

Note that this solution assumes that `input.txt` and `/input.txt` are the same file, and `docs` and `/docs` are the same directory. However, the actual behavior of `access` can vary depending on the operating system and filesystem configuration. 

If you want to perform these checks in a more portable way, you should use the function `stat`, which provides more information about the existence and accessibility of files and directories. It can be used instead of `access`:

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    struct stat file_info, dir_info;

    if (stat("input.txt", &file_info) != 0 || stat("/input.txt", &file_info) != 0) {
        printf("File does not exist!\n");
        return -1;
    }

    if ((file_info.st_mode & S_IFMT) == S_IFREG && file_info.st_uid == geteuid()) {
        // File exists and can be accessed by the current user
        // Additional checks can be performed here based on other attributes in `file_info`
    }

    if (stat("docs", &dir_info) != 0 || stat("/docs", &dir_info) != 0) {
        printf("Directory does not exist!\n");
        return -2;
    }

    if ((dir_info.st_mode & S_IFMT) == S_IFDIR && dir_info.st_uid == geteuid()) {
        // Directory exists and can be accessed by the current user
        // Additional checks can be performed here based on other attributes in `dir_info`
    }
}
```

This solution is more portable and provides more information about the existence, accessibility, and permissions of files and directories. However, it also requires additional checks to be done depending on your specific requirements.
