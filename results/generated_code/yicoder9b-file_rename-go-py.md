Here is the equivalent Python code for your Golang program: 

```python
import os

# Rename in current directory
try:
    os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt')
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(e)

try:
    os.rename('docs', 'mydocs')
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(e)

# Rename in filesystem root directory
try:
    os.rename('/input.txt', '/output.txt')
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(e)

try:
    os.rename('/docs', '/mydocs')
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(e)
```
Note that the os.rename() method in Python also checks for file existence like Go's os.Rename does and raises a FileNotFoundError if it encounters one. Therefore we use a try/except block to catch this error and print an appropriate message. 

Also, unlike Golang where you have to specify the full path when renaming files in root directory (i.e., starting with '/'), Python allows specifying absolute paths directly without any special characters at the start of the string. 

The above code assumes that you have the necessary permissions to rename these directories or files. If not, a PermissionError would be raised and caught by except block.
