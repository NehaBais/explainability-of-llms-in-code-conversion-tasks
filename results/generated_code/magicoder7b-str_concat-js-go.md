 In Golang, you can use the `+` operator for string concatenation as well. Here is how the JavaScript code would look in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	s := "hello"
	ss := s + " there!"
	fmt.Println(s, ss)
}
```
In this code, the string `s` is initialized with the value `"hello"` and then another string variable `ss` is created by concatenating `s` with the string `" there!"`. The content of both variables are printed to the console using `fmt.Println()`.
