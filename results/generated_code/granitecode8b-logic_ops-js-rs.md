Here's the converted code in Rust:
```
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
 println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
 println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
 println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
```
In this Rust code, we define a function called `logic` that takes two boolean arguments, `a` and `b`. We then use the logical operators `&&`, `||`, and `!` to perform the "and", "or", and "not" operations on the arguments. Finally, we print out the results using the `println!` macro.
