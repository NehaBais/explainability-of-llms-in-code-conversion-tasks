 Sure! Here's how you can convert the given Go code to JavaScript:

```javascript
let s = "world!";
s = "Hello, " + s;
```

In this JavaScript code:
- A string variable `s` is initialized with the value `"world!"`.
- The existing value of `s` is then concatenated with the string `"Hello, "`, resulting in `s` now being `"Hello, world!"`.
