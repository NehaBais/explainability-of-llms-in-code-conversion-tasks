Here is the equivalent Go code for your JavaScript code using `os` and `path/filepath` packages to check if a file exists or not. 

For checking in current working directory, we use "." (which represents the current working directory). 

To check it for root filesystem, We use "/" as path. Please note that Go doesn't support direct methods for folder existence like `FolderExists` does in Javascript. So, I am using `os.Stat` to get info about "docs" dir and checking if error is of type `os.IsNotExist(err)` which returns a boolean value indicating whether the error is due to the file or directory not existing.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
	"path/filepath"
)

func checkFileOrFolderExists(fileName string) {
	_, err := os.Stat(fileName) 
	if err != nil {
        if os.IsNotExist(err) {
            fmt.Println("File or Folder Does not Exists:", fileName)            
        } else {
			fmt.Printf("error occurred while checking %s : %v\n", fileName, err) 
		}
    } else{
        fmt.Println(fileName , "Exists")        
    }
}

func main() {
	// for current working directory
	checkFileOrFolderExists("input.txt")
	checkFileOrFolderExists("docs")
    
	//for filesystem root
	root, _ :<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>ups, I didn't check the error!  
	checkFileOrFolderExists(filepath.Join(root, "input.txt"))
	checkFileOrFolderExists(filepath.Join(root, "docs"))
}
``` 
The function `checkFileOrFolderExists` is checking if a file or directory exists by getting its information with os.Stat(). If an error occurs and the error code indicates that the file or directory does not exist (os.IsNotExist(err)), it prints out a message stating that it doesn't exist; otherwise, it prints out that it exists.

Remember to handle errors properly in your production-level Go code! The above example is for illustrative purposes only and won't work as expected without error checking.
