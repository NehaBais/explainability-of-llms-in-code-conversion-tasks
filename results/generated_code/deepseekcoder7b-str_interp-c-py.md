The Python version of the given C code would be as follows -

```python
extra = "big"
print("Mary had a %s lamb." % extra)
```

In Python, string interpolation is done using the `%` operator followed by variables or values. This replaces "%s" in the original string with the value of variable 'extra' during execution.
