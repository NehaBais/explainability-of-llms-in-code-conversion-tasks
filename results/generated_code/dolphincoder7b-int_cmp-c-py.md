Sure, here's the equivalent Python code:
```python
# Ask user for two integers
a = int(input("Please enter first integer: "))
b = int(input("Please enter second integer: "))

# Check conditions using comparison operators and print results accordingly.
if a < b:
    print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
elif a == b:
    print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```
In this Python code, we are using the `input` function to get two integers from the user. We then use the `if-elif-else` structure to check for each condition separately and display a message accordingly. This is a basic example of how to compare two numbers in Python. The comparison operators used are `<`, `==`, and `>`.
