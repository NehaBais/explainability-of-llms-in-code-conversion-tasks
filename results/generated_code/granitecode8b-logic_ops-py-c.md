Here is the converted code from Python to C:
```
#include 
void logic(int a, int b) {
 printf("a and b: %d
", a && b);
 printf("a or b: %d
", a || b);
 printf("not a: %d
", !a);
}
```
Note that the logical AND operator in C is denoted by "&&" and the logical OR operator is denoted by "||". The logical NOT operator is denoted by "!". Also, I have used the standard input/output library for C.
