Here's the C code that satisfies the requirements: 
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>

/* Function to check if a file exists and is readable */
int check_file(const char *path) {
    struct stat buf;
    int result = 0;
    /* Check if the file path is null */
    if (path == NULL) {
        return -1;
    }
    /* Check if the file exists and is readable */
    result = lstat(path, &buf);
    if (result < 0) {
        perror("lstat() error");
    } else {
        if ((buf.st_mode & S_IFMT) == S_IFREG && access(path, R_OK)) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int result;
    /* check if the file exists and is readable in current working directory */
    result = check_file("input.txt");
    if (result == 1) {
        printf("Input.txt exists and is readable\n");
    } else {
        printf("Input.txt does not exist or is not readable\n");
    }

    /* check if the file exists and is readable in filesystem root */
    result = check_file("/docs/input.txt");
    if (result == 1) {
        printf("/docs/input.txt exists and is readable\n");
    } else {
        printf("/docs/input.txt does not exist or is not readable\n");
    }
}
```
You can run the code by saving it to a file with an ".c" extension, compiling it using the gcc compiler, and then executing the resulting executable. 

Here are some potential issues with this code:
* The function `check_file` is not reentrant or thread-safe because it modifies global variables like `errno` and `lastPath`, which can cause race conditions or other problems if multiple threads call the function simultaneously. To fix this issue, you can make a copy of these variables for each invocation of the function.
* The function `check_file` is not robust against malicious input because it blindly trusts the file system to report that a path exists and is readable without further checking its actual contents. To fix this issue, you can use the `access` function with the `F_OK` flag to check if the file or directory actually exists in the file system before attempting to read from it.
* The code does not handle errors properly because it simply prints error messages using `perror`, which may not be useful for debugging or production environments. To fix this issue, you can use more robust error handling mechanisms like checking the return value of each function and printing a custom error message if something goes wrong.
