In Java, you can use the `Files` class to achieve this side effect of creating a directory and its parents if they do not already exist. Here is how to implement it:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Files.createDirectories(Paths.get("/tmp/some/path/to/dir"));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while creating the directory: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This code will attempt to create the directory `/tmp/some/path/to/dir` and its parent directories if they do not already exist, similar to what you would achieve using `os.MkdirAll("/tmp/some/path/to/dir", 0770)` in Golang. If an error occurs while creating the directory (for example, due to insufficient permissions), it will be caught and an error message will be printed.
