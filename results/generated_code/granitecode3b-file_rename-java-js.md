Sure! Here's the JavaScript code that achieves the same requirement:
```
const fs = require('fs');
// Rename a file in the current working directory
fs.renameSync('input.txt', 'output.txt');
// Rename a file in the root directory
fs.renameSync('/input.txt', '/output.txt');
// Rename a directory in the current working directory
fs.renameSync('docs', 'mydocs');
// Rename a directory in the root directory
fs.renameSync('/docs', '/mydocs');
```
This code uses the `fs` module from Node.js to perform file and directory operations. The `renameSync` method is used to rename files and directories synchronously, which means it blocks until the operation completes. The paths are provided as strings, but they can also be `Buffer` objects if necessary.
