Here is your code converted to JavaScript:

```javascript
let str = "12345678";
str += "9!";
console.log(str);
```

This script does the same thing as your Python script: it creates a string variable `str`, appends another string literal with an exclamation mark, and then prints out the contents of the string. The JavaScript version uses the `let` keyword to declare a variable instead of `str =`. The `+=` operator is used for appending in JavaScript just like in Python. Lastly, `console.log(str);` is used to print the value of `str` to the console.
