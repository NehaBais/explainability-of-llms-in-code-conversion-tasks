Here's the converted Java code that meets your requirements:
```
String s = ", World";
s = "Hello" + s;
System.out.println(s);
``` 
In this Java code, we first declare a string variable `s` and assign it the value ", World". Then, we prepend the string variable with another string literal "Hello" using the concatenation operator `+`. Finally, we print the resulting string to the console using the `println()` method.
