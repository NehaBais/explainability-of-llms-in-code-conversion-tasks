 The JavaScript code provided is using ActiveXObject which is specific to the scripting environment of Internet Explorer and not native to JavaScript itself. Thus, there's no exact equivalent in C++ for this JavaScript functionality. 

However, if you want to check the existence of a file/directory in C++, the closest method would be to use the `std::ifstream` class to test if a file exists and `boost::filesystem` to check if a directory exists. Here's how you might do it:
```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>

int main() {
    std::ifstream myfile;
    
    // Checking for the file in current working directory 
    if(boost::filesystem::exists("input.txt")){
        std::cout << "File exists: input.txt\n";
    }else{
        std::cout << "File does not exist: input.txt\n";
    }
    
    // Checking for the file in a directory in root of filesystem  
    myfile.open("c:/input.txt");
    if(!myfile){
        std::cout << "File exists: c:/input.txt\n";
    }else{
        std::cout << "File does not exist: c:/input.txt\n";
    }
    
    // Checking for the directory in current working directory 
    if(boost::filesystem::exists("docs")){
        std::cout << "Directory exists: docs\n";
    }else{
        std::cout << "Directory does not exist: docs\n";
    }
    
    // Checking for the directory in a root of filesystem  
    if(boost::filesystem::exists("c:/docs")){
        std::cout << "Directory exists: c:/docs\n";
    }else{
        std::cout << "Directory does not exist: c:/docs\n";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
Note that you need to include the `boost/filesystem.hpp` header file for this code to work as well as have boost installed on your system.
