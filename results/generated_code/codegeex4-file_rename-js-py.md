The equivalent Python code for the given JavaScript code is:

```python
import os

# Rename in current working directory
os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt')
os.rename('/input.txt', '/output.txt')  # Assuming you have permission to rename files outside your cwd
os.rename('docs', 'mydocs')
os.rename('/docs', '/mydocs')

```
In Python, os module provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system. Please note that if you try to rename file/directory which does not exist in current working directory, it will throw FileNotFoundError.

Also, please be aware that `os.rename` function requires read and write permissions on both source and destination and also the necessary directory permissions for moving files outside of the current directory.

Additionally, it is important to mention that Python's os module doesn't handle exceptions as much as VBScript does. If you attempt to rename a non-existent file or directory, it will raise a FileNotFoundError which should be handled using a try/except block. Please note that '/input.txt' and '/docs' might not always point to your root directory but they typically point to the same directory Python is running in.

It's also important to note that these operations can fail for a number of reasons (e.g., if you don't have permission to rename files or directories, or if the destination file or directory already exists). You might want to add error handling code to handle such scenarios.
