 In Python, you can achieve the same result as follows:

```python
s = "foo" + "bar"
print(s)
```

In Golang, a string literal is created using `+` operator and a built-in function `WriteString`. This Golang code snippet creates a new instance of `strings.Builder`, writes the two strings to it (`foo` and `bar`), then prints out its content as a string. In Python, you just concatenate the two strings directly without going through the hassle of creating an instance of `strings.Builder`.
