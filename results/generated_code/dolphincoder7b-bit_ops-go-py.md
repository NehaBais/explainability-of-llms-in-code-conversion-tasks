This is a very large task. Here's the Python version:

```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    a = uint16(a)
    b = uint32(b)

    print("a:", bin(a))
    print("b:", bin(b))

    # Bitwise logical operations
    print("and:", bin(a & b))
    print("or:", bin(a | b))
    print("xor:", bin(a ^ b))
    print("not:", bin(~a))

    if b < 0:
        print("Right operand is negative, but all shifts require an unsigned right operand (shift distance).")
        return

    # Logical shifts (unsigned left operand)
    print("shl:", bin(a << b))
    print("shr:", bin(a >> b))

    # Arithmetic shifts (signed left operand)
    print("las:", bin(a << b))
    print("ras:", bin(a >> b))

    # Rotations
    ror = int16(int16(uint16(a >> b)) | a << (16 - b))
    rol = uint16(a << b | int16(uint16(a) >>(16 - b)))
    print("rol:", bin(rol))
    print("ror:", bin(ror))
```
This code uses the `bin` function from Python's built-in `int.from_bytes` function to convert integers to binary strings for printing. The `uint16` and `uint32` functions are used to sign extend the result of bitwise operations, but I'm not sure if that is what the question was asking for or how it's supposed to work in Python.

Please note that Python does not have a built-in bitwise rotate operator (`>>>` and `<<<`). These can be emulated using bitwise shift operators combined with logical negation, like `a << b | int16(uint16(a) >>(16 - b))` for right rotation.
