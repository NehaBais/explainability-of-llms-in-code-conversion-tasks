Unfortunately, JavaScript does not have built-in support for file and directory operations that are as powerful as C++'s `std::filesystem` library. However, you can use Node.js's `fs` and `path` modules to achieve similar functionality.

Here is an example of how you can create a new empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory called "docs" in the current working directory and the filesystem root:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Create output.txt in the current working directory
fs.open(path.join(__dirname, 'output.txt'), 'w', (err, fd) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    fs.close(fd, () => {});
});

// Create output.txt at the filesystem root
fs.open('/output.txt', 'w', (err, fd) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    fs.close(fd, () => {});
});

// Create docs in the current working directory
fs.mkdir(path.join(__dirname, 'docs'), { recursive: true }, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
});

// Create docs at the filesystem root
fs.mkdir('/docs', { recursive: true }, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
});
```
Note that creating a file or directory in the filesystem root may require elevated permissions, depending on your operating system and user account.
