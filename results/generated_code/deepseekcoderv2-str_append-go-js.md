 Certainly! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code to achieve the same functionality as the provided Go code:

```javascript
let s = "foo";
s += "bar";
console.log(s);
```

In this JavaScript code:
- We initialize a string variable `s` with the value `"foo"`.
- We then append the string `"bar"` to `s` using the concatenation operator (`+=`).
- Finally, we print the contents of `s` using `console.log()`.
