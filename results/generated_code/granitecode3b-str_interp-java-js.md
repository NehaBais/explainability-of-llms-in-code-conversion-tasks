Here's the equivalent JavaScript code:
```
let adjective = "little";
let lyric = `Mary had a ${adjective} lamb`;
```
In this code, we use template literals (enclosed in backticks) to interpolate the value of `adjective` into the string. The result is the same as the Java code: the original string "Mary had a X lamb." is replaced with "Mary had a little lamb" when `adjective` is set to "little".
