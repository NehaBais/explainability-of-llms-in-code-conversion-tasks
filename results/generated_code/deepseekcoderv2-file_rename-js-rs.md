 Sure, here is the equivalent Rust code to achieve the same functionality:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Move file in current working directory
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt")?;
    
    // Move file in filesystem root (assuming the user has permissions)
    fs::rename("c:/input.txt", "c:/output.txt")?;
    
    // Move folder in current working directory
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs")?;
    
    // Move folder in filesystem root (assuming the user has permissions)
    fs::rename("c:/docs", "c:/mydocs")?;

    Ok(())
}
```

This Rust code uses the `std::fs` module to rename files and directories. The `fs::rename` function is used to move the files and directories as specified. Note that on Windows, paths are typically in the format `C:/path/to/file`, and this code assumes you have permissions to perform these operations.
