Sure, here is the equivalent code in Python:

```python
# Python doesn't have a strict type system like JavaScript
# It automatically converts types to perform comparisons

print(
"abcd" == "abcd", # True
123 == "123", # Type Error: cannot compare 'str' and 'int' in comparison (Python throws error if types are different)
"ABCD".lower() != "abcd".lower(), # False (case sensitive)
"ABCD".upper() <= "abcd".upper(), # True
)
```

In Python, you can compare strings in lexical and case-sensitive manner by using `==` and `!=` with the same or different string values. For comparison of numeric strings which are not treated lexically in Python, it raises a TypeError stating "unorderable types: str() < int()" error when they are compared in an inequality expression. However, this could be avoided by converting the numeric strings to integers before performing the comparison as shown above.
