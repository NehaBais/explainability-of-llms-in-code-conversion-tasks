Answer: In Rust, you can use the `+` operator to append strings together. Here's how it would look in Rust code:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("abc");
    println!("{}", s); // Print initial string "abc"
    s += "def"; // Append "def" to the end of the string
    println!("{}", s); // Print updated string with appended characters
}
```
In this example, `String::from` is used to create a new String instance from an existing string literal. The `+=` operator is then used to append another string to the end of the variable `s`. Finally, the updated string value is printed using the `println!` macro.
