Sure, here is the equivalent code in Python:

```python
import os

def rename_files_and_directory():
    err = "File move error"
    
    # Renaming files and directory in the current working directory
    try:
        os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
        print("Renamed input.txt to output.txt in the current working directory.")
        
        os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
        print("Renamed docs to mydocs in the current working directory.")
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"{err}: {e}")
    
    # Renaming files and directory in the filesystem root
    try:
        os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
        print("Renamed /input.txt to /output.txt in the filesystem root.")
        
        os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
        print("Renamed /docs to /mydocs in the filesystem root.")
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"{err}: {e}")

rename_files_and_directory()
```

This Python code does the same thing as your Rust code. It renames a file and directory both in the current working directory and in the filesystem root, handling exceptions appropriately.

Please note that modifying files and directories in the filesystem root may require administrative privileges. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform these operations.
