Here is the converted code from Python to C that verifies the existence of a file called input.txt and a directory called docs in both the current working directory and the root filesystem:
```c
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 // Check if input.txt exists in the current working directory
 char* filename = "input.txt";
 struct stat st;
 int rc = stat(filename, &st);
 if (rc == 0) {
 printf("File %s exists in the current working directory.n", filename);
 } else {
 printf("File %s does not exist in the current working directory.n", filename);
 }
 // Check if input.txt exists in the root filesystem
 char* filepath = "/input.txt";
 rc = stat(filepath, &st);
 if (rc == 0) {
 printf("File %s exists in the root filesystem.n", filepath);
 } else {
 printf("File %s does not exist in the root filesystem.n", filepath);
 }
 // Check if docs directory exists in the current working directory
 char* dirname = "docs";
 rc = stat(dirname, &st);
 if (rc == 0) {
 printf("Directory %s exists in the current working directory.n", dirname);
 } else {
 printf("Directory %s does not exist in the current working directory.n", dirname);
 }
 // Check if docs directory exists in the root filesystem
 char* dirpath = "/docs";
 rc = stat(dirpath, &st);
 if (rc == 0) {
 printf("Directory %s exists in the root filesystem.n", dirpath);
 } else {
 printf("Directory %s does not exist in the root filesystem.n", dirpath);
 }
 return 0;
}
```
Note that the `stat` function is used to check the existence of files and directories, and it returns 0 if the file or directory exists and a non-zero value otherwise. The `printf` statements are used to print the results of the checks.
