Below is the Java equivalent of your Golang code:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        renameFile("input.txt", "output.txt");
        renameDirectory("docs", "mydocs");
        renameFile("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
        renameDirectory("/docs", "/mydocs");
    }

    private static void renameFile(String oldName, String newName) {
        File oldFile = new File(oldName);
        File newFile = new File(newName);

        if (oldFile.exists()) {
            oldFile.renameTo(newFile);
        } else {
            System.out.println("The file " + oldName + " does not exist.");
        }
    }

    private static void renameDirectory(String oldName, String newName) {
        File oldDir = new File(oldName);
        File newDir = new File(newName);

        if (oldDir.exists() && oldDir.isDirectory()) {
            oldDir.renameTo(newDir);
        } else {
            System.out.println("The directory " + oldName + " does not exist or it is not a directory.");
        }
    }
}
```

This code performs exactly the same functionality as your Golang code. It renames two files and two directories, once in the current working directory and once in the filesystem root. The `renameFile` method handles file renaming while the `renameDirectory` method handles directory renaming.

Please remember that in Java, to rename a directory you must ensure that the new name does not exist or that it is empty if it exists. Also, Java's File.renameTo() method returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful or not.

This code doesn't check the return status of the rename operation, and it will silently fail if any error occurs during renaming. It also doesn't handle exceptions that might be thrown when creating the file or directory objects. In a production environment you would want to add appropriate exception handling to deal with these situations appropriately.
