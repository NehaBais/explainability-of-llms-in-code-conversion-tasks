Here is the equivalent code in JavaScript:

```javascript
let s = 'hello';
console.log(s);

let s1 = s + ' world';
console.log(s1);
```

In this code, `s` and `s1` are variables that store strings. The first line sets `s` to 'hello' and the second line prints its value. Then a new variable `s1` is created by concatenating `s` and the string ' world'. The third line prints out the value of `s1`.
