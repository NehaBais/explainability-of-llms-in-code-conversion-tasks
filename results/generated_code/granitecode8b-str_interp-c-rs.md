Here's the Rust code that performs string interpolation using the given values and defined variables:
```
fn main() {
 let extra = "little";
 println!("Mary had a {} lamb.", extra);
}
```
In this Rust code, we define a variable `extra` with the value "little". We then use string interpolation to replace the placeholder `{}` in the `println!` macro call with the value of `extra`. The resulting string is printed to the console.
