Here is the equivalent code in JavaScript:

```javascript
let str = "foo";
str += "bar";
console.log(str);
```

In JavaScript, you can append to a string using the `+=` operator. The `console.log()` function is used to output the contents of the variable after the append operation, which is similar to `fmt.Print(s.String())` in Golang.
