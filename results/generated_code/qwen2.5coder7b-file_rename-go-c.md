Sure, here is the equivalent code in C. Note that unlike Go, C does not have built-in functions for renaming files and directories as easily as Go does with `os.Rename`. We'll need to use system calls for this purpose.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void rename_file_or_directory(const char *old_name, const char *new_name) {
    if (rename(old_name, new_name) == -1) {
        perror("Error renaming file or directory");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Current working directory
    rename_file_or_directory("input.txt", "output.txt");
    rename_file_or_directory("docs", "mydocs");

    // Filesystem root
    rename_file_or_directory("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    rename_file_or_directory("/docs", "/mydocs");

    return 0;
}
```

This C code performs the same operations as your Go code:

1. Renames `input.txt` to `output.txt` in the current working directory.
2. Renames `docs` to `mydocs` in the current working directory.
3. Renames `/input.txt` to `/output.txt` at the filesystem root.
4. Renames `/docs` to `/mydocs` at the filesystem root.

Note that you need to have appropriate permissions to rename files and directories, just like in your Go code. The `rename` function is used for both files and directories in C on most systems. If `rename` fails (e.g., due to insufficient permissions), it will return `-1`, and we handle this by printing an error message and exiting the program with a failure status.

To compile and run this C code:

1. Save it to a file, e.g., `rename_files.c`.
2. Compile it using a C compiler like GCC:
   ```sh
   gcc -o rename_files rename_files.c
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```sh
   ./rename_files
   ```

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to perform these operations in your current working directory and at the filesystem root.
