Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for your Go program:

```python
# text assigned to a string variable
s = "hello"

# print the content of the variables
print(s)

# concatenate variable and literal, assign result to another string variable
s2 = s + ' literal'

# print second string variable
print(s2)
```

This Python code will accomplish the same tasks as your Go program. It creates a string `s` with the value "hello", prints its content, concatenates it with the literal string ' literal', and then prints the result of this concatenation.
