The given C code is creating a directory and its parent directories if they do not exist. This can be directly translated to Rust without changing much of the logic since Rust has built-in support for file system operations including creating directories. Here's the equivalent Rust code:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let path = PathBuf::from("./path/to/dir");
    if !path.exists() {
        fs::create_dir_all(&path)?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

This Rust code does the same thing: it creates a directory and any missing parents if they don't already exist. It uses `std::fs::create_dir_all`, which will create all necessary parent directories (if not existing) to the path passed as argument. If a directory with the same name already exists, it will not throw an error but return Ok(()).
