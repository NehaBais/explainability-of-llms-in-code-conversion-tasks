In JavaScript, you can use the `+=` operator which is shorthand for appending to a String variable. Here's how your code would look in JavaScript:

```javascript
let string = "def";
string = "abc" + string;
``` 

This will take the value of 'def', prepend it with 'abc', and then store that new combined string back into `string`. Running this script, for example, would result in 'abcd'.
