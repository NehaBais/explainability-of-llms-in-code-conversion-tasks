Here is the equivalent Python code for creating empty files and directories as per Java code requirement:

```python
import os

def create_files():
    try:
        open('output.txt', 'a').close()  # Creates a new file with 0 bytes
        open(os.sep + 'output.txt', 'a').close()
        os.mkdir('docs') # Makes an empty directory
        os.mkdir(os.sep + 'docs')
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

create_files()
```

This Python code does the same thing as your Java code - It creates an empty file named "output.txt" and an empty directory named "docs" twice in the current working directory and once in the filesystem root. If any error occurs during this process, it will print that error on console. 

Please note that Python doesn't have a direct equivalent of `File.separator` provided by Java, so we use `os.sep` instead which dynamically fetches the system's file path separator (`/` for Unix systems and `\` for Windows).
