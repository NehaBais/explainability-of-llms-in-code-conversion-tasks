In Java, you can achieve this by using the `+` operator for concatenation. Here's how you might write your code:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "hello";
        String t = s + " there!";
        
        System.out.println(s);
        System.out.println(t);
    }
}
```
In the above Java program, `s` is a string variable assigned with the value `"hello"`. The string variable `t` is then created by concatenating the original string `s` with the string literal `" there!"`.

The `System.out.println()` function is used to print the content of the variables `s` and `t` to the console.
