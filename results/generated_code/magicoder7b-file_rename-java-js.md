 The JavaScript equivalent of the Java code would be:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs'); 
const path = require('path');

function renameFile(oldname, newname) {
    // File (or directory) with old name
    const file = fs.statSync(oldname);
    
    if (!file.isFile() && !file.isDirectory()) {
        console.log(`The ${oldname} does not exist.`);
        return false; 
    }

    // File (or directory) with new name
    const file2 = fs.statSync(newname);
    
    if (file2 && !file2.isDirectory()) {
        console.log(`A file or directory named ${newname} already exists.`);
        return false; 
    }

    try {
      // Rename file (or directory)
      fs.renameSync(oldname, newname);  
      return true; 
    } catch (err) {
       console.error(`Unable to rename ${oldname} into ${newname}.`, err);
       return false; 
    }
}

function test(type, oldname, newname) {
    console.log(`The following ${type} called ${oldname}` +
        (renameFile(oldname, newname) ? ` was renamed as ` : ` could not be renamed into`) + 
        `${newname}.`);
}

test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
test("file", path.resolve(__dirname, "input.txt"), path.resolve(__dirname, "output.txt"));
test("directory", "docs", "mydocs");
test("directory", path.resolve(__dirname, "docs"), path.resolve(__dirname, "mydocs"));
```
Please note that this JavaScript code also checks if a file (or directory) with the new name already exists before attempting to rename it. If such an item does exist, the operation will fail and an error message will be displayed. 
Also, the `renameFile` function has been updated to work directly with file paths instead of just the file names as this makes more sense in a JavaScript context where we often deal with absolute paths.
