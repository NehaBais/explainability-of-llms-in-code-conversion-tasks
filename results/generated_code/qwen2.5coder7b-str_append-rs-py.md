The Python version of the given Rust code would be:

```python
def main():
    hello = "Hello world"
    hello += "!!!!"
    print(hello)

main()
```

In this code, we first define a string variable `hello` with any text value. Then we use the `+=` operator to append another string literal to it. Finally, we print the contents of the variable after the append operation.
