Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task as the Golang code:
```python
import shutil
# Rename a file in the current working directory
shutil.move("input.txt", "output.txt")
# Rename a directory in the current working directory
shutil.move("docs", "mydocs")
# Rename a file in the root filesystem directory
shutil.move("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
# Rename a directory in the root filesystem directory
shutil.move("/docs", "/mydocs")
```
Note that in Python, we use the `shutil` module to perform file and directory operations, which is more user-friendly than using the `os` module directly.
