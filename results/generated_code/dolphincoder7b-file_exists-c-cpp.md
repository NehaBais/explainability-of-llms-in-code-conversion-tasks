This code uses the `sys/types.h` and `sys/stat.h` libraries to perform operations on files and directories, including checking for regular files (with `S_ISREG`) and directories (with `S_ISDIR`). The `main()` function then checks the existence of two files ("input.txt" and "docs") in the current working directory (`check_reg` and `check_dir`), as well as the same files in the filesystem root (`/input.txt` and `/docs`). Finally, it prints the results to the console.

In C++, you can use the `std::filesystem` library for similar functionality:
```cpp
#include <iostream>  // For cout
#include <filesystem>  // For filesystem operations (C++17)

int main() {
    std::cout << "input.txt is a regular file? "
        << (std::filesystem::is_regular_file("input.txt") ? "yes" : "no");

    std::cout << "\ndocs is a directory? " 
        << (std::filesystem::is_directory("docs") ? "yes" : "no");

    return 0;
}
```
