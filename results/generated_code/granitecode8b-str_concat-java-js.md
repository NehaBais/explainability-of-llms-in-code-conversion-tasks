Here's the JavaScript code that meets the requirements:
```
var s = "hello";
console.log(s + " literal");
var s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```
In this code, we declare a string variable `s` and assign it the value `"hello"`. We then concatenate `s` with the string literal `" literal"` using the `+` operator, and store the result in a new string variable `s2`. Finally, we log the contents of both variables to the console.
