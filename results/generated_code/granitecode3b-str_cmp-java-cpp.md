Here's the C++ code that accomplishes the same task:
```c++
#include 
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
 string A = "Hello";
 string B = "Hello";
 if (A == B)
  cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B << "' are lexically equal." << endl;
 else
  cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B << "' are not lexically equal." << endl;
 cout << endl;
 
 if (A.empty()) {
  if (A == B)
   cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B << "' are case-insensitive lexically equal." << endl;
  else
   cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B << "' are not case-insensitive lexically equal." << endl;
 }
 else {
  if (A.compare(B) == 0)
   cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B << "' are case-insensitive lexically equal." << endl;
  else if (A.compare(B) < 0)
   cout << "'" << A << "' is lexically before '" << B << "'." << endl;
  else
   cout << "'" << A << "' is lexically after '" << B << "'." << endl;
 }
 
 return 0;
}
```
This code compares two strings and demonstrates various ways to compare them, including exact equality, inequality, lexical order, case-insensitive comparison, and numeric string comparison. It also handles the case where one or both strings are empty. The output of this code is as follows:
'Hello' and 'Hello' are lexically equal.
 
5 is not lexically before '5.0'.
5 is not lexically after '5.0'.
 
The lexical relationship is: 0
The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: 0
