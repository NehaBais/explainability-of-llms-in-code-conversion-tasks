Sure! Here's the Java code that converts the given Rust code snippet:
```java
public class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  String a = "abc";
  String b = "Bac";

  // Strings are coerced to String when borrowed and needed
  if (a.equals(b)) {
   System.out.println("The strings are equal");
  }
  if (!a.equals(b)) {
   System.out.println("The strings are not equal");
  }
  if (a.compareTo(b) > 0) {
   System.out.println("The first string is lexically after the second");
  }
  if (a.compareTo(b) < 0) {
   System.out.println("The first string is lexically before the second");
  }
  if (!(a.compareTo(b) > 0)) {
   System.out.println("The first string is not lexically after the second");
  }
  if (!(a.compareTo(b) < 0)) {
   System.out.println("The first string is not lexically before the second");
  }

  // case-insensitives:

  // equality
  // this avoids new allocations
  if (a.equalsIgnoreCase(b)) {
   System.out.println("Both strings are equal when ignoring case");
  }

  // everything else, create owned Strings, then compare as above
  String a2 = a.toUpperCase();
  String b2 = b.toUpperCase();

  // repeat checks
 }
}
```
This Java code should produce the same output as the given Rust code. The main differences between the two languages are that in Java, comparisons are done on the basis of lexical order, while in Rust, comparisons are done based on the result of comparing their Unicode values. Additionally, Java has a more expressive type system and supports more advanced string operations such as pattern matching.
