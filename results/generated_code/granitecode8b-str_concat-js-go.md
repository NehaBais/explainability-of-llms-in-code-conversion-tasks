Here's the Golang code that meets the requirements:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
 s := "hello"
 fmt.Println(s + " there!")
}
```
This code creates a string variable `s` and assigns it the value `"hello"`. It then concatenates this string with another string literal `" there!"` using the `+` operator, and prints the resulting string to the console. The output of this program will be:

hello there!

Note that in Golang, string literals are enclosed in double quotes (`""`), just like in JavaScript.
