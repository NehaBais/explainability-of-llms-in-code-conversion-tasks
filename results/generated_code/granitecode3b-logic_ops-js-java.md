Here's the equivalent Java code for the given JavaScript function:
```
public static void logic(boolean a, boolean b) {
 System.out.println("a AND b: " + (a && b));
 System.out.println("a OR b: " + (a || b));
 System.out.println("NOT a: " + (!a));
}
```
The Java code is equivalent to the given JavaScript function in terms of functionality, as it performs the same logical operations on the two boolean arguments and prints the results. The only difference is that Java uses the `&&` and `||` operators for logical AND and OR respectively, while JavaScript uses the `and()` and `or()` methods.
