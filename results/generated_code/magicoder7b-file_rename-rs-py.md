 The equivalent Python code would be:

```python
import os

def rename_files():
  try:
      # Rename in the current directory
      os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
      os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
      
      # Rename in the root directory
      os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
      os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error occurred while renaming files - {str(e)}")
      
rename_files()
```

This Python code also assumes the user has the necessary permissions to perform these operations. It uses `os` module in Python which provides a portable way of using operating system related functionalities. 

Please note that this might not work perfectly for Windows as it does not allow you to create, delete or rename files and folders with leading slashes `/`.
