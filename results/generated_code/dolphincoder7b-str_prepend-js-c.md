This is a simple JavaScript code that demonstrates how to prepend a string in C. Here's the equivalent C code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char s[] = ", World"; // No built-in prepend so we need to use strcpy and strcat
    char new_s[] = "Hello";

    strcat(new_s, s);  // Concatenate the strings
    printf("%s\n", new_s);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `strcat` is used to concatenate two strings. The resulting string is stored in a variable named `new_s`. The function `printf` then prints the concatenated string. Finally, it returns 0, indicating successful execution.
