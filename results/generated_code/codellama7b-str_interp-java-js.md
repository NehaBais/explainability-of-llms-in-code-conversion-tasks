The code provided is in Java, and it can be converted to JavaScript as follows:
```
const adjective = 'little';
const lyric = `Mary had a ${adjective} lamb`;
```
In JavaScript, template literals are used for string interpolation. The `${adjective}` syntax is used to insert the value of the variable `adjective` into the string. This will result in the same outcome as the Java code, where the string "Mary had a little lamb" is created and assigned to the variable `lyric`.
