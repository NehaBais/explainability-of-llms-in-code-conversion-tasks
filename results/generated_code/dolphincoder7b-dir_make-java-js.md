The Java code you provided is not directly related to JavaScript. Here's an equivalent JavaScript function that creates a directory using the `mkdirs()` method, which creates all non-existing parent directories:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
function mkdir(path) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        fs.promises.mkdir(path, { recursive: true })
            .then(() => resolve())
            .catch((err) => reject(err));
    });
}
mkdir('./path/to/dir')
    .then(() => console.log("path successfully created"))
    .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```
This JavaScript function uses the `fs` module for file system operations and returns a promise that resolves once the directory is successfully created or rejects if an error occurs. For further details and examples, please refer to the Node.js documentation for `fs`. Also, make sure you install the `fs` module by running `npm install fs` before trying this example.
