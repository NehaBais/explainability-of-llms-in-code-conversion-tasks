Java does not have a built-in FileSystemObject to mimic file and folder operations like the scripting you provided in JavaScript. In Java, we use java.io package for handling files and directories. Here is how it can be done using `java.io` package methods: 

```java
import java.io.File;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // here in the current working directory
        rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
        rename("docs", "mydocs");
        
        // filesystem root, assuming it's C: drive
        rename("C:/input.txt", "C:/output.txt");
        rename("C:/docs", "C:/mydocs");
    }
    
    private static void rename(String source, String target){
        File oldFile = new File(source);
        File newFile = new File(target);
        
        // move file
        if (oldFile.renameTo(newFile)){
            System.out.println("Successfully moved from " + source + " to " + target);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to move from " + source + " to " + target);
        }
    }
}
```
Please note that the provided Java code assumes you're running this in an environment where File I/O operations are allowed (like a server or computer without user-interaction). Also, it does not handle errors from trying to move folders. This would require extra checking and handling since moving directories can be tricky with files inside them.
