This problem cannot be solved directly in C++. The main issue is because of the language's lack of explicit operator overloading for all mathematical operations like + - * / % etc. 

We can achieve similar functionality by using some additional programming logic, which would involve defining our own types that provide operator functions (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus), as well as exponentiation if it is a valid operation in the chosen integer context.

Here's how it could look in Rust:
```rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<_> = env::args().collect();
    let a = args[1].parse::<i32>().unwrap();
    let b = args[2].parse::<i32>().unwrap();

    println!("sum:              {}", add_integers(a, b));
    println!("difference:       {}", subtract_integers(a, b));
    println!("product:          {}", multiply_integers(a, b));
    // The integer quotient here is not defined in the same way as with division. 
    // Rust doesn't have a built-in operator for this operation.
    // You could implement it manually or provide a hint to the user about how it might work.
    println!("integer quotient: {}", a / b); // truncates towards zero
    if let Some(_) = &((a % b) as i8) { 
        println!("remainder:        {}", a % b);  // same sign as first operand
    } else {
        println!("remainder:        N/A (modulus does not yield a valid result for the given input)");
    }
}
```
Note that exponentiation is not supported in Rust. If the operation was valid and implemented, you would need to include the math library and define your own function or use the standard operator `**`. This isn't provided in this example. 

If the division operation were defined as truncating towards zero, it could be accomplished with:

pub fn integer_division(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    ((a / b) as f64).abs() as i32
}

This function returns the floor of the absolute value of `(a / b)`. It truncates towards zero for the integer quotient.
