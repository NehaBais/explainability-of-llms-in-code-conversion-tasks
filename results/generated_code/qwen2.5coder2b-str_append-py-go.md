In Go, you can achieve this by using string concatenation which is written with `+`. Here's how to convert the given Python code into a Golang program:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    str := "12345678"
    str += "9!"
    fmt.Println(str)
}
```

When you run this program, it will output `123456789!`.
