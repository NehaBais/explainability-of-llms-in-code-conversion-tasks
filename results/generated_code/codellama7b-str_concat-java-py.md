 Here is the equivalent Python code:
```
s = 'hello'
print(s + 'literal')
s2 = s + 'literal'
print(s2)
```
Note that in Python, you can simply concatenate two strings using the `+` operator. Also note that the `System.out.println()` method is not needed since it is not a part of Python's standard library.
