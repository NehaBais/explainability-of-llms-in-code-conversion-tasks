 Sure! Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given C++ code:

```javascript
let greeting = "Hello";
greeting += " , world!";
console.log(greeting);
```

In this JavaScript code:
- We initialize a string variable `greeting` with the value "Hello".
- We use the concatenation operator `+=` to append " , world!" to the existing string.
- Finally, we print the contents of the `greeting` variable using `console.log()`.
