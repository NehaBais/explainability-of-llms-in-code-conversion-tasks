Here is the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
let s = "01234567890";

const n = 3;
const m = 4;
const c = '2';
const sub = "456";

console.log(s.substring(n, n + m))
console.log(s.substring(n)))
console.log(s.substring(0, s.length - 1))))
console.log(s.substring(s.indexOf(c), m))))
console.log(s.substring(s.indexOf(sub), m))))
```
This JavaScript code performs the same operations as your C++ code. The `String` class in JavaScript has several methods that can be used to manipulate strings, such as `substr()`, `substring()`, and so on. In this code, I have used the `substring()` method, which returns a portion of a string between two indices (inclusive), or from one index to the end of the string. The first argument is the starting index (inclusive), and the second argument is the ending index (exclusive).
