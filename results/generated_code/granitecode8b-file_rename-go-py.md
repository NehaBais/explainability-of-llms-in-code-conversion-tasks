Here's the Python code that achieves the same requirement as the Golang code:
```python
import os
def rename_file():
 try:
  os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
  os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
 except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error renaming file: {e}")
def rename_file_root():
 try:
  os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
  os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
 except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error renaming file in root directory: {e}")
rename_file()
rename_file_root()
```
This code defines two functions, `rename_file()` and `rename_file_root()`, that attempt to rename the files and directories specified. If any errors occur during the renaming process, the code will catch them and print an error message. 
The first function calls `os.rename()` twice, once in the current working directory and once in the root directory. The second function calls `os.rename()` with the full pathnames to ensure that the files are renamed in the correct locations.
