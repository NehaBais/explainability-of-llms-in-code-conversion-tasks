Sure! Here's the converted code in JavaScript:
```
function printLogic(a, b) {
  console.log(`a and b is ${a && b}`);
  console.log(`a or b is ${a || b}`);
  console.log(`not a is ${!a}`);
}
```
Note that in JavaScript, the `&&` operator performs logical AND operation between two values, while the `||` operator performs logical OR operation between two values. Similarly, the `!` operator performs logical NOT operation on a value.
