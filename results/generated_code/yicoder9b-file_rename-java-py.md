The equivalent Python code for the given Java code is as follows:
```python
import os
def rename(oldname, newname):
    try: 
        os.rename(oldname, newname)
        return True
    except OSError:
        return False

def test(type_, oldname, newname):
    print('The following ' + type_ + ' called ' + oldname + (' was renamed as ' if rename(oldname, newname) else ' could not be renamed into ' )+ newname + ".")

test('file', 'input.txt', 'output.txt')
test('file', '/input.txt', '/output.txt')
test('directory', 'docs', 'mydocs')
test('directory', '/docs/', '/mydocs/')
``` 
In this Python code: os module provides functions for interacting with the operating system; rename function renames a file or directory. If there is an error (for example, insufficient permissions), it raises OSError which we catch and handle by returning False. test function tests renaming of files/directories and prints relevant message.
