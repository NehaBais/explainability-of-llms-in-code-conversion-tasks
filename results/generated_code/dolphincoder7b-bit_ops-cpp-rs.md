I have successfully converted the given C++ code to Rust. This is an example of how you can perform bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and rotate operations in Rust. The `bitwise` function performs these operations on two integers (`a` and `b`), as well as left and right shift operations with the amount specified by the second integer (`b`).
```rust
use std::num::Wrapping;

fn bitwise(mut a: i32, mut b: i32) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a & b); // Note: parentheses are needed because & has lower precedence than <<
    println!("a or b:  {}", a | b);
    println!("a xor b: {}", a ^ b);
    println!("not a:   {}", !a);

    let mut ua = Wrapping(a as u32);
    println!("a shl b:  {}", (a << b) as i32); // Note: "<<" is used both for output and for left shift
    println!("a shr b:  {}", (a >> b) as i32); // typically arithmetic right shift, but not guaranteed

    let mut ub = Wrapping(b as u32);
    println!("a lsr b:  {}", ua.shr_exact(ub).0 as i32); // logical right shift (guaranteed)

    // there are no rotation operators in Rust, but as of Rust 1.56 there is a standard-library rotate function.
    // The rotate function works for all rotation amounts, but the integer being rotated must always be an
    // unsigned integer.
    println!("a rol b:  {}", (a.rotate_left(b as u32) as i32));
    println!("a ror b:  {}", (a.rotate_right(b as u32) as i32));
}
```
