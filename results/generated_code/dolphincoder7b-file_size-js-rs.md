To convert the JavaScript code to Rust, we can use the fs crate, which provides a high-level interface to interact with the file system. The `std::fs` module in Rust also includes methods for reading and writing files. Here's an example of how we can implement the same logic in Rust:
```rust
use std::fs;
fn main() {
    match fs::metadata("input.txt") {
        Ok(md) => println!("Size of input.txt: {} bytes", md.len()),
        Err(_) => eprintln!("Error reading file input.txt"),
    }
    match fs::metadata("/input.txt") {
        Ok(md) => println!("Size of /input.txt: {} bytes", md.len()),
        Err(_) => eprintln!("Error reading file /input.txt"),
    }
}
```
In this code, we use the `fs::metadata` function to get information about a file or directory in the file system. If it is successful, we print the size of the file using `md.len()`. Otherwise, we report an error. The Rust standard library also includes a method for checking if a path exists without actually accessing the filesystem. This can be useful when working with environment variables and configuration files.
