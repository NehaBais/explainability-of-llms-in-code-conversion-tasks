This is the Python code that satisfies the requirements of the original Go code:
```
# This program demonstrates how to assign a value to a string variable and
# concatenate it with another string literal.

# Create a string variable equal to any text value.
s = "hello"

# Output the string variable.
print(s)

# This output was requested by the original task description, although not required.
print(s + "literal")

# Concatenate the string variable with another string literal and assign the result to another string variable.
s2 = s + "literal"

# Output the second string variable.
print(s2)
```
