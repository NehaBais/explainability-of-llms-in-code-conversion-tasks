Here is how you can convert the given C++ code to JavaScript:

```javascript
let greeting = "Hello";
greeting += ", world!";
console.log(greeting);
```

In this JavaScript code, `let` keyword is used to declare a variable. The string `Hello` is appended with another string literal ", world!" using the `+=` operator which is more idiomatic way in JavaScript than `.append()` method of C++. Finally, it shows the contents of the variable after the append operation by logging it to the console.
