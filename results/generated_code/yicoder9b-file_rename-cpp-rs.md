In Rust there is no direct equivalent to the C++ std::rename() function because it's not part of the standard library. The functionality can be achieved with the std::fs::rename() method, which replaces one file or directory with another.

Below you will find two possible conversions for renaming files and directories in the current working directory as well as at root level:

```rust
use std::ffi::OsString;
use std::process;

fn main() {
    // rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the current working directory
    if let Err(e) = std::fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt") {
        eprintln!("unable to rename file: {}", e);
        process::exit(1);
    }

    // rename the "docs" directory to "mydocs" in the current working directory
    if let Err(e) = std::fs::rename("docs", "mydocs") {
        eprintln!("unable to rename directory: {}", e);
        process::exit(1);
    }

    // The following two are not straightforward in Rust because it doesn't support absolute paths
    // without a current working directory. A way around this is to use the OsString or String type
    // and manually set the root path, but it's generally better to keep such operations within 
    // the current working directory as they are more portable across different operating systems.
    if let Err(e) = std::fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt") {
        eprintln!("unable to rename file at root: {}", e);
       process::exit(1);
    }

    if let Err(e) = std::fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs") {
        eprintln!("unable to rename directory at root: {}", e);
        process::exit(1);
    }
}
```
This code will exit with a status of 1 if any of the renames fail and print an error message. In Rust, it's idiomatic to return errors explicitly rather than using unwrapping or panicking which can make debugging harder.
