Sure, here's the Python code that fulfills the requirement you specified:
```
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))
print("Sum:", a + b)
print("Difference:", a - b)
print("Product:", a * b)
print("Quotient ( truncated towards zero ):", a // b)
print("Remainder:", a % b)
```
This code prompts the user to enter two integers, calculates their sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder using Python's built-in functions, and then displays the results. The `//` operator is used for integer division that truncates towards zero, while the `%` operator returns the remainder of a division operation.
