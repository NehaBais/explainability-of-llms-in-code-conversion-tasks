To convert the given Java code to C, we need to perform file and directory renaming using system calls. Here is the equivalent C code that accomplishes the same task:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Function to rename a file or directory
int rename_file_or_dir(const char* oldname, const char* newname) {
    if (rename(oldname, newname) == 0) {
        return 1; // Success
    } else {
        perror("Error renaming");
        return 0; // Failure
    }
}

// Function to test the rename operation
void test(const char* type, const char* oldname, const char* newname) {
    printf("The following %s called %s ", type, oldname);
    if (rename_file_or_dir(oldname, newname)) {
        printf("was renamed as ");
    } else {
        printf("could not be renamed into ");
    }
    printf("%s.\n", newname);
}

int main() {
    // Test in the current working directory
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs");

    // Test in the filesystem root (assuming the program is run with appropriate permissions)
    test("file", "/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    test("directory", "/docs/", "/mydocs/");

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **rename_file_or_dir Function**:
   - This function takes two arguments: `oldname` and `newname`.
   - It uses the `rename` system call to rename the file or directory.
   - If the `rename` call is successful, it returns 1 (true); otherwise, it prints an error message using `perror` and returns 0 (false).

2. **test Function**:
   - This function takes three arguments: `type`, `oldname`, and `newname`.
   - It prints a message indicating whether the rename operation was successful or not.
   - It calls the `rename_file_or_dir` function to perform the renaming.

3. **main Function**:
   - This is the entry point of the program.
   - It tests the renaming operations in both the current working directory and the filesystem root.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the program has the necessary permissions to rename files and directories.
- The `rename` function can fail for various reasons such as insufficient permissions, invalid paths, or the target path already existing. Always check the return value of `rename` for proper error handling.
- In the C code, absolute paths are used for testing in the filesystem root, assuming that the program is run with appropriate permissions. If running from a different context, you might need to adjust the paths accordingly.
