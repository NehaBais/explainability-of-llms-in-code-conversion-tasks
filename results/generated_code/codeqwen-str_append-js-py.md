Here is the Python equivalent for your JavaScript code:

```python
s1 = "Hello"
s1 += ", World!"
print(s1)
```

This code will create a string variable `s1` with value "Hello". It then appends to that variable another string literal ", World!", and finally prints the contents of the variable after the append operation.
