The provided Rust code is to rename files and directories in the file system for the current working directory and filesystem root using the `std` (Standard library) module of the programming language Rust. 

Below is the equivalent JavaScript version:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function renameFile(oldPath, newPath){
    try {
        fs.renameSync(oldPath, newPath);
        console.log(`${oldPath} is renamed to ${newPath}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to rename ${oldPath}: ${error}`);
    } 
};

const oldDir = 'docs';
const newDir = 'mydocs';
const oldFile = 'input.txt';
const newFile = 'output.txt';

// Rename directory in the current working directory
renameFile(oldDir, newDir);
// Rename file in the current working directory
renameFile(oldFile, newFile); 
```

The above code will first rename `docs` to `mydocs` in the current directory. Then it will rename `input.txt` to `output.txt` in the same directory. The root filesystem is not specified here, so the two file operations are done on the working directory (which is typically where you run your JavaScript program).

Please note: this code uses `fs.renameSync()` function which returns void and does not return an error object if renaming fails. If you want to catch failures, you can replace it with `try { .. } catch(error)` and print the error message to console.
Also, for file system operations in Node.js, remember that file paths are relative to the directory where your node script is located (unless specified otherwise), so make sure you have the correct file paths.
