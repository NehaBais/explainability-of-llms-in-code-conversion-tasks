Sure, here's how you can convert your JavaScript code to Python:

```python
# No built-in prepend 
s = ", World"

# Concatenation in Python is done with the '+' operator
s = "Hello" + s

print(s)
```

In this Python version, I have used the plus sign (+) for string concatenation, which is equivalent to JavaScript. Also note that unlike JavaScript, there's no need to declare variable types in Python.
