Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for the given Java example:

```python
adjective = "little"
lyric = f'Mary had a {adjective} lamb'
print(lyric)
```

In this Python code, we are using string formatting to replace the placeholder '%s' in the `String.format()` method with the value of `adjective`. The formatted string is then printed.
