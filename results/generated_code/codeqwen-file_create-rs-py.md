The given Rust code creates an empty file and directory named 'output.txt' and 'docs', respectively, in the current working directory (represented by "."), as well as in the root directory. Here is the Python equivalent of this code:

```python
import os
import errno

file_name = "output.txt"
dir_name = "docs"

def create(root):
    try:
        os.makedirs(os.path.join(root, dir_name))
        with open(os.path.join(root, file_name), 'w'):
            pass
    except OSError as e: 
        if e.errno != errno.EEXIST: 
            raise

def main():
    create(".")
    create("/")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
In this Python code, we are using the os.makedirs function to create a directory and open(..., 'w') to create an empty file. The 'try/except' block is used for error handling: if makedirs or open fails (because the directory already exists), we ignore the error (with e.errno != errno.EEXIST). If any other error occurs, it is re-raised as before.
