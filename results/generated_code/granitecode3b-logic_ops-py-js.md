Sure! Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given Python function:
```javascript
function logic(a, b) {
  console.log('a and b:', a && b);
  console.log('a or b:', a || b);
  console.log('not a:', !a);
}
```
Note that in JavaScript, the `&&` operator performs a logical AND operation on two values, while the `||` operator performs a logical OR operation. Additionally, the `!` operator negates its operand (i.e., if the operand is true, it will be false and vice versa).
