Here is the equivalent Python code for your C++ code:

```python
greeting = "Hello"
greeting += ", world!"
print(greeting)
```

This code does exactly what your C++ code does: it creates a string variable `greeting` equal to `"Hello"`, then appends the string literal `", world!"` to it, and finally prints out the resulting value of `greeting`.
