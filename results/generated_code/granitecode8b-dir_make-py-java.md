Here's how you can implement the `mkdirp` function in Java:
```java
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
public class DirectoryCreator {
 public static void mkdirp(String path) {
 Path directory = Paths.get(path);
 if (directory.toFile().exists()) {
 return;
 }
 try {
 Files.createDirectories(directory);
 } catch (Exception e) {
 throw new RuntimeException("Failed to create directory: " + e.getMessage());
 }
 }
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 mkdirp("./path/to/dir");
 }
}
```
This implementation uses the `Files` class from the Java NIO (New Input/Output) package to create directories. It first checks if the directory already exists, and returns immediately if it does. If not, it attempts to create the directory using the `createDirectories` method. If an exception is thrown during this process, it will be caught and rethrown as a runtime exception.
Note that the `mkdirp` function in Java doesn't have the same behavior as the Python version, as it doesn't create intermediate-level directories if they don't already exist. However, it should be sufficient for most use cases where you only need to create a single directory and its parents if they don't already exist.
