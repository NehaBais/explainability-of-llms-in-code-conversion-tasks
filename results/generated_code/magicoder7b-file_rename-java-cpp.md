 In C++, the functionality to rename a file or directory can be achieved by using `rename` function from the `<cstdlib>` library for POSIX system and `_wrename` for Windows systems. Here's how you could convert your Java code to C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

int main() {
    std::cout << "The following file called input.txt was renamed as output.txt." << std::endl;
    std::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    
    std::cout << "The following file called /input.txt was renamed as /output.txt." << std::endl;
    std::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");

    std::cout << "The following directory called docs was renamed as mydocs." << std::endl;
    // You can't use the same rename function because directories require a different approach and may not have the same syntax in all systems
#ifdef _WIN32
    _wrename(L"docs", L"mydocs");
#else
    std::rename("docs/", "mydocs/");
#endif
    
    std::cout << "The following directory called /docs/ was renamed as /mydocs/." << std::endl;
    // Windows doesn't support forward slashes in paths, so we use backslash instead. The root of the filesystem (/) is usually not writable anyway.
#ifdef _WIN32
    _wrename(L"/docs\\", L"/mydocs\\");
#else
    std::rename("/docs/", "/mydocs/");
#endif
    
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that, in C++, file paths are usually specified with backslashes instead of forward slashes. Also, the `std::rename` function behaves differently for directories and regular files (since you can't actually "move" a directory, you typically have to delete it and then recreate it). For this reason, in C++ we use `_wrename` with wide strings (`L"docs"` instead of `"docs/"`) to rename directories on Windows.

Also, remember that the user must have write permissions for both the source file (or directory) and destination path.
