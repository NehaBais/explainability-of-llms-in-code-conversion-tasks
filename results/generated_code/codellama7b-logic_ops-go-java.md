Sure! Here's the equivalent code in Java:
```
public static void printLogic(boolean a, boolean b) {
    System.out.println("a and b is " + (a && b));
    System.out.println("a or b is " + (a || b));
    System.out.println("not a is " + (!a));
}
```
Note that in Java, the `&&` operator is used for logical AND, while the `||` operator is used for logical OR. Additionally, the `!` operator is used to negate a boolean value.
