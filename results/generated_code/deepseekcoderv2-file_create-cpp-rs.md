## Solution
The following code converts the given C++ code into Rust. It uses the `std` module of the Rust standard library and creates an empty file called "output.txt" in the current working directory, then it creates another one with the same name in the filesystem root. Next, it creates a directory named "docs" in both locations.
```
use std::fs;
use std::io::Write;

fn main() {
    let mut f = std::fs::File::create("output.txt").expect("Failed to create file");
    fs::write("/output.txt", b"").expect("Failed to write to file");
    fs::create_dir("docs").expect("Failed to create directory");
    fs::create_dir("/docs").expect("Failed to create directory");
}
```
