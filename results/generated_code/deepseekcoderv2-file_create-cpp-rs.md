 To convert the given C++ code to Rust, we need to use the `std::fs` module for file and directory operations. Here's how you can do it in Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Create a new empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes in the current working directory
    let mut f = fs::File::create("output.txt")?;
    drop(f); // Close the file

    // Create a new empty file called "/output.txt" of size 0 bytes in the filesystem root
    let mut f = fs::File::create("/output.txt")?;
    drop(f); // Close the file

    // Create an empty directory called "docs" in the current working directory
    fs::create_dir("docs")?;

    // Create an empty directory called "/docs" in the filesystem root
    fs::create_dir("/docs")?;

    Ok(())
}
```

This Rust code performs the same operations as the C++ code: creating a new empty file `output.txt` with size 0 bytes, first in the current working directory and then in the filesystem root, and also creates an empty directory called `docs` in both the current working directory and the filesystem root.
