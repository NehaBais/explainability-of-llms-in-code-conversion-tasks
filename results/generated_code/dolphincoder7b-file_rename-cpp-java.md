This is a very simple task to convert C++ code to Java. Java doesn't have the `std` namespace, so you don't need to import any libraries to use `std`. Here's how the equivalent Java code looks like:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Rename "input.txt" into "output.txt" and "docs" into "mydocs", both in the current working directory
        System.rename("input.txt",  "output.txt");
        System.rename("docs",  "mydocs");
        
        // Rename "/input.txt" into "/output.txt" and "/docs" into "/mydocs"
        System.rename("/input.txt",  "/output.txt");
        System.rename("/docs",  "/mydocs");
    }
}
```

This Java code does essentially the same task in two steps:

1. In the first step, it renames "input.txt" into "output.txt" and "docs" into "mydocs". The difference is that you don't need to specify the file extension when you rename a directory, like `.txt` in C++.
2. In the second step, it renames "/input.txt" into "/output.txt" and "/docs" into "/mydocs". This is because Java doesn't have filesystem root (`/`) as part of the path separator.

Please note that renaming files or directories may not be allowed by your operating system, so you might need to run this code with administrative privileges. Also, it's essential to check whether these operations are allowed before proceeding with them, because if they're not permitted, a runtime exception will be thrown.
