In C, there is no built-in support for UTF-8 or UTF-16 strings with Unicode characters beyond BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane). However, if you use the libiconv library to handle encoding/decoding operations on UTF-8 strings in C, below is a possible implementation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <libiconv.h>

void print_substr(char *s, int n, int m) {
    if (n > 0 && n <= strlen(s)) 
        printf("%.*s\n", m, &s[n-1]);
}

int main() {
    const char *s = "abcdefgh";
    size_t s_size = strlen(s);
    
    int n = 2;
    int m = 3;
    char ch = 'd';
    const char *chars = "cd";
    
    print_substr(s, n, m);   // starting from n=2 characters in and m=3 length;
    print_substr(s, n, s_size - n + 1);  // starting from n characters in, up to the end of the string;
    
    if (s_size > 0) 
        printf("%.*s\n", (int)s_size-1, s);   // whole string minus last character;
        
    char *found = strchr(s, ch);
    if (found && m <= s_size - (found - s)) 
        print_substr(found, 1, m);   // starting from a known character "d" within the string and of m length;
        
    found = strstr(s, chars);
    if (found && m <= s_size - (found - s)) 
        print_substr(found, 1, m);   // starting from a known substring "cd" within the string and of m length;
    
    return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>_size;
}
```
The C standard library does not support Unicode strings directly. So this code uses libiconv to handle UTF-8/UTF-16 encoding, but its usage is not demonstrated in this snippet. 

This will only work with ASCII and ISO Latin characters as the requirements stated do not require handling of any kind of unicode character beyond BMP.
