 Here's the Java code that satisfies the requirements:
```java
void print_logic(boolean a, boolean b) {
	System.out.println("a and b is " + (a && b));
	System.out.println("a or b is " + (a || b));
	System.out.println("not a is " + !a);
}
```
In Java, we use '&&' for the logical AND operator instead of C's '&&'. Similarly, Java uses '||' for the logical OR operator, instead of C's '||'. Finally, in Java, we use '!' to negate a boolean value, whereas C uses the '~' operator.
