 To convert the given Java code to Rust, you can use the `std::fs` module for file operations and formatting for large numbers (`num_format`). Below is the equivalent Rust code:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Verify the size of a file called input.txt for a file in the current working directory
    let file_a = Path::new("file.txt");
    match fs::metadata(&file_a) {
        Ok(meta) => println!("{}, B", meta.len()),
        Err(_) => eprintln!("File not found: {}", file_a.display()),
    }

    // Verify the size of a file called input.txt for a file in the file system root
    let file_b = Path::new("/file.txt");
    match fs::metadata(&file_b) {
        Ok(meta) => println!("{}, B", meta.len()),
        Err(_) => eprintln!("File not found: {}", file_b.display()),
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: 
   - `std::fs`: For file system operations like reading metadata.
   - `std::path::Path`: To handle file paths.
   - `std::io`: For error handling.

2. **File Paths**:
   - `file_a` is set to the current working directory's "file.txt".
   - `file_b` is set to the root directory's "file.txt".

3. **Metadata Retrieval**:
   - `fs::metadata(&file_a)` and `fs::metadata(&file_b)` are used to get the metadata (including size) of the files.
   - If the file does not exist, an error is caught, and a message indicating the file was not found is printed.

4. **Output**:
   - The size in bytes is printed using `meta.len()`, which formats large numbers with commas if necessary.

This Rust code performs the same functionality as the provided Java code but uses Rust's standard library for file operations and error handling.
