Sure! Here's the Rust code for the bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, right shift, left rotate, and right rotate operations on two integers:
```
fn main() {
    let a = -460;
    let b = 6;

    // Bitwise logical operations
    println!("{}", (a & b));
    println!("{}", (a | b));
    println!("{}", (a ^ b));
    println!("{}", (!a));

    // Logical shifts (unsigned left operand)
    println!("{}", (a << b));
    println!("{}", (a >> b));

    // Arithmetic shifts (signed left operand)
    println!("{}", (a << b));
    println!("{}", (a >> b));

    // Rotations
    println!("{}", ((a & !b) | (!!b)));
    println!("{}", ((a & !!b) | (b << ub)));
}
```
Note that in Rust, you can use the bitwise operators `&`, `|`, and `^` to perform the corresponding operations on integers. The `!` operator is used for the NOT operation. The left shift (`<<`) and right shift (`>>`) operators work on both signed and unsigned integers, but the rotation operators require an unsigned right operand (shift distance).

Also note that in Rust, you can use the `println!` macro to print the results of the operations to the console.
