Here's how you can convert the given C code into Python. 

```python
# Get two integers from the user
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: ")))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: ")))


# Display a message based on the condition between the two integers
if a < b:
    print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
elif a == b:
    print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")


```

This Python code does the same thing as your requested C conversion. It prompts the user for two integers, and then prints out a different message based on whether the first integer is less than, equal to, or greater than the second integer.
