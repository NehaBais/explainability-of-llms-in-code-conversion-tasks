Here's the Java code that accomplishes the task:
```java
import java.io.File;
public class FileRenamer {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 String input = "input.txt";
 String output = "output.txt";
 String directory = "docs";
 String newDirectory = "mydocs";
 
 File fileToRename = new File(input);
 boolean renamed = fileToRename.renameTo(new File(output));
 if (renamed) {
 System.out.println("File renamed successfully");
 } else {
 System.out.println("Failed to rename file");
 }
 
 File directoryToRename = new File(directory);
 String newPath = "/" + newDirectory; // Use forward slash as separator for Unix-based systems
 boolean renamedDir = directoryToRename.renameTo(new File(newPath));
 if (renamedDir) {
 System.out.println("Directory renamed successfully");
 } else {
 System.out.println("Failed to rename directory");
 }
 }
}
```
This code uses the `File` class to rename files and directories in Java. The first two lines of code set the input and output file names, as well as the directory name that needs to be renamed.
The `renameTo()` method is then used to rename the files. It takes a new `File` object as an argument, which specifies the new location and name for the file or directory. If the renaming is successful, the program prints "File renamed successfully" or "Directory renamed successfully". Otherwise, it prints "Failed to rename file" or "Failed to rename directory", respectively.
Note that in this code, we use forward slash ("/") as the separator for Unix-based systems. On Windows, backslash ("\\") should be used instead.
