To convert the given C++ code to Python, you would need to replace the standard library functions with their equivalent ones in Python. Here is how the code can be written:

```python
import os

def rename_files():
    # Rename files in the current working directory
    os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt')
    os.rename('docs', 'mydocs')

    # Rename files in the root directory
    os.rename('/input.txt', '/output.txt')
    os.rename('/docs', '/mydocs')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    rename_files()
```

This Python code uses the `os` module to perform file renaming operations. The `rename()` function is used to change the name of a file or directory in Python. Note that this script assumes the user running it has sufficient permissions to modify the files and directories at the specified locations.
