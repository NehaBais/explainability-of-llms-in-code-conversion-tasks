Here's your converted JavaScript code:

```javascript
var s = "world!";
s = "Hello, " + s;
```

In this JavaScript code, we declare a variable `s` and assign it the string value `"world!"`. 

We then set the value of `s` equal to the concatenation of the string literal `"Hello, "`` and the current value of `s`.
