 Here is the equivalent Rust code:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let file_path1 = "input.txt";
    let file_path2 = "/input.txt";
    
    match fs::metadata(file_path1) {
        Ok(meta) => println!("The size of '{}' is: {} bytes", file_path1, meta.len()),
        Err(_) => eprintln!("File '{}' not found or cannot access it.", file_path1),
    }
    
    match fs::metadata(file_path2) {
        Ok(meta) => println!("The size of '{}' is: {} bytes", file_path2, meta.len()),
        Err(_) => eprintln!("File '{}' not found or cannot access it.", file_path2),
    }
}
```
Please note that the second argument to fs::metadata() should be the full path of the file you want to get size information for. "/input.txt" refers to the root directory of your filesystem by convention, which is probably not where you put "input.txt". If you meant "input.txt" in the root directory, then it should be written as "/input.txt".
