In C language, we can use the `strcmp` function from the <string.h> library to compare two strings. The strcmp function takes two strings as arguments and returns an integer value based on their lexicographical order.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void compare(const char *a, const char *b) {
    int result = strcmp(a, b);

    if (result == 0)
        printf("%s and %s are lexically equal.\n", a, b);
    else
        printf("%s and %s are not lexically equal.\n", a, b);

    if (result < 0)
        printf("%s is lexically before %s\n", a, b);
    else if (result > 0)
        printf("%s is lexically after %s\n", a, b);

    printf("The lexical relationship is: %d\n", result);

    if (strcmp(a, b) == 0 || strcmp(a, b) == -1)
        printf("The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: %d\n", strcmp(a, b));
}

int main() {
    compare("Hello", "Hello");
    compare("5", "5.0");
    compare("java", "Java");
    compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ");
    compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĵãvá");

    return 0;
}
```

Note that the C language does not support case-insensitive string comparison directly, so we use strcmp with a modified version of the strings (convert all characters to lowercase or uppercase) if needed.

Also note that C does not have a concept of numeric string ordering like Java. Numeric string must be treated as an integer value when using the `<` and `>` operators. If you need to compare numeric strings, you can convert them to integers before comparing.
