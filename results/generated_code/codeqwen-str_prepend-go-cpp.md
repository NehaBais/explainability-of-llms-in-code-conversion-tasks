Sure, here's how you can convert this Golang code to C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string s = "world!";
    s = "Hello, " + s;
    std::cout << s << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code does exactly the same thing as your Golang code. It creates a string variable `s` with the value `"world!"`, then prepends it with `"Hello, "`. Finally, it prints out the resulting string to the console.
