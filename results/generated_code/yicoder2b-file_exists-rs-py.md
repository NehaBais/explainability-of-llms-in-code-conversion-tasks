The provided code is written in Rust. It verifies whether there are certain files or directories in the current working directory and filesystem root. It uses `std::fs` crate to interact with file system related features.

In Python, we can use built-in modules like os for these tasks. Here's how you could convert this code:

```python
import os

def check_files(file1, file2):
    for file in [file1, file2]:
        if os.path.exists(file):
            print(f"{file} exists")
            if os.path.isdir(file):
                print(f"{file} is a directory")
            else:
                print(f"{file} is a file")
        else:
            print(f"{file} does not exist")
            
# Invoke the function for current working dir and root
check_files("input.txt", "docs")
```
This Python code checks if files and directories 'input.txt' and 'docs' (in your current directory or filesystem root) exist and provides appropriate messages.
