Here is the equivalent code in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	greeting := "Hello"
	greeting += ", world!"

	fmt.Println(greeting)
}
```
This Go code does the same thing as the given C++ code. It declares a string variable `greeting` with an initial value of "Hello". Then it appends another string literal ", world!" to the `greeting` string. Finally, it prints out the contents of the `greeting` string.
