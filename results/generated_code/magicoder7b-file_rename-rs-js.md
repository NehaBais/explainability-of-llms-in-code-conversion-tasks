 In JavaScript, you can use the `fs` module in Node.js to achieve similar functionality as in Rust. Here's an equivalent implementation:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

function renameFiles() {
    const err = "File move error";
    try {
        fs.renameSync("input.txt", "output.txt");
        fs.renameSync("docs", "mydocs");
        fs.renameSync("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
        fs.renameSync("/docs", "/mydocs");
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(err, error);
    }
}

// Call the function
renameFiles();
```
Note that `fs.renameSync` is used instead of `fs.rename`, which will block until completion or an exception will be thrown if any error occurs during the rename operation. Also, unlike Rust version, this JavaScript version cannot handle errors separately for each file (since it doesn't return errors). The function will throw and catch a general error that can potentially contain information about why individual operations failed. This is because Node.js does not differentiate between different types of errors in the rename operation, such as whether a file or directory does not exist, etc.
