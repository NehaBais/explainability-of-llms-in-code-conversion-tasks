The equivalent code in Java would be:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class Main {
    static void printFileSize(String f) {
        File file = new File(f);
        if (file.exists()) {
            long sizeInBytes = file.length();
            System.out.println(sizeInBytes);
        } else {
            System.err.println("The file does not exist.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printFileSize("input.txt");
        printFileSize("/input.txt");
    }
}
```
This program will print the size of a file in bytes if it exists, and also handles cases where the file does not exist. The File class in Java provides methods for working with files and directories. We use the length method to get the size of the file in bytes. Note that we're printing sizeInBytes directly to output because Java doesn't have a built-in equivalent to Go's Size() function, but you can easily modify it if necessary.
