 Certainly! Here's the equivalent Python code for the given Java code:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
string = "abc"
print(string)  # Show the contents of the variable after initialization

# Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way
string += "def"
print(string)  # Show the contents of the variable after appending
```

This Python code does exactly what the Java code does: it initializes a string variable, prints its value, appends another string to it, and then prints the updated value.
