 This code demonstrates several string comparison operations in C and their counterparts in Go. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The first block of code defines several macros for comparing strings in C, including `STREQ`, `STRNE`, `STRLT`, `STRGT`, `STRGE`, and `STRLE`. These macros compare two string pointers and return 0 if they are equal, a positive value if the first argument is greater than the second, or a negative value if the first argument is less than the second.
2. The next block of code defines several macros for comparing strings in C while ignoring case sensitivity, including `STRCEQ`, `STRCNE`, `STRCLT`, `STRCGT`, `STRCGE`, and `STRCLE`. These macros compare two string pointers and return 0 if they are equal, a positive value if the first argument is greater than the second while ignoring case sensitivity, or a negative value if the first argument is less than the second while ignoring case sensitivity.
3. The third block of code defines a function called `compare` that takes two string pointers as arguments and prints out the results of comparing them using the macros defined in the previous block.
4. The fourth block of code defines a function called `comparecase` that is similar to `compare`, but it compares the strings while ignoring case sensitivity.
5. The final block of code defines a `main` function that takes an arbitrary number of arguments and calls the `compare` and `comparecase` functions on each pair of arguments. It also includes a loop that repeatedly calls `compare` and `comparecase` until all arguments have been used up.

In Go, you can perform string comparisons using the `==` operator for exact equality, the `!=` operator for inequality, or the `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` operators for lexical comparison. You can also use the `strings` package to perform case-sensitive and case-insensitive comparisons.

Here's an example of how you could implement the same functionality in Go:
```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func compare(a, b string) {
	fmt.Printf("%s %t %t %t %t %t\n", a, a == b, a != b, a > b, a < b, a >= b)
}

func comparecase(a, b string) {
	fmt.Printf("%s %t %t %t %t %t ignoring case\n", a, strings.EqualFold(a, b), strings.EqualFold(a, b), a > b, a < b, a >= b)
}

func main() {
	args := os.Args[1:]
	for _, arg := range args {
		compare(arg, "ball")
		comparecase(arg, "ball")
	}
}
```
This code uses the `strings` package to perform case-sensitive and case-insensitive comparisons. It also demonstrates how you can use the `<`, `>`, `<=` and `>=` operators to compare strings lexically.
