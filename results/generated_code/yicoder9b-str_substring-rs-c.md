The Rust language is a powerful system programming language which provides memory safety and efficient abstraction without giving up on performance. While C is a general-purpose language that's excellent for systems programming, it lacks some of the conveniences provided by Rust like automatic memory management (using `Box` and `Rc`) or UTF-8 support out of the box.

Converting the given code to C would require a bit more work as C is a lower level language than Rust. Here's an equivalent C program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char s[] = "abc文字化けdef";
    size_t n = 2;
    size_t m = 3;

    // Print 3 characters starting at index 2 (c文字)
    printf("%.*s\n", (int)m, s + n); // C does not support arbitrary Unicode manipulation out of the box

    // Print all characters starting at index 2 (c文字化けdef)
    printf("%s\n", s + n);  

    // Print all characters except the last (abc文字化けde)
    s[strlen(s)-1] = '\0'; // C-strings are null-terminated. We replace the last char with a null to terminate the string.
    printf("%s\n", s); 

    // Print 3 characters starting with 'b' (bc文) - assuming only single byte characters for simplicity
    char* cpos = strchr(s, 'b'); // find position of character b in the string
    if(cpos){
        printf("%.*s\n", (int)m, cpos); 
    }
  
    // Print 3 characters starting with "けd" (ぱひじ) - assuming only single byte characters for simplicity
    char* spos = strstr(s, "けd"); // find position of substring "けd" in the string
    if(spos){
        printf("%.*s\n", (int)m, spos); 
    }

    return 0;  
}
```
Please note that C does not support Unicode out of the box and this code assumes single-byte characters for simplicity. For full UTF-8 support you would need a library such as `charls` or custom logic to find the correct positions in the string.
