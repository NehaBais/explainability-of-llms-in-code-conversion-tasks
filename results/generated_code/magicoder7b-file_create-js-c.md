 Unfortunately, there is no direct equivalent of JavaScript's "require" module in C. Also, C doesn't have built-in support for creating directories or empty files. However, you can use the system calls to create a new file and an empty directory from within your program. Below is an example how to do it:

```c
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void fct(int err) {
    if (err != 0) printf("Error: %s\n", strerror(err));
}

// Create a new file named "output.txt" in the current working directory
int main() {
    int result = open("output.txt", O_CREAT | O_EXCL, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR); 
    if (result < 0) fct(errno);
    
    // Create a new file named "output.txt" in the root directory
    result = open("/output.txt", O_CREAT | O_EXCL, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR); 
    if (result < 0) fct(errno);
    
    return 0;
}
```

Note: This C code will work only on Unix-like systems. For Windows you would use CreateFile function from WinAPI instead of open. Also, the file is created with read & write permissions for owner only. You might need to adjust the third parameter according to your specific requirements.
