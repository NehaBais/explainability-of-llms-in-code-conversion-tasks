Sure! Here's the converted code in JavaScript:
```
function logic(a, b) {
  console.log(`a AND b: ${a && b}`);
  console.log(`a OR b: ${a || b}`);
  console.log(`NOT a: ${!a}`);
}
```
Note that in JavaScript, you can use the `console.log()` function to output values to the console, and you don't need to use the `System.out.println()` method like in Java. Also, in JavaScript, the logical operators are `&&` for "and", `||` for "or", and `!` for "not".
