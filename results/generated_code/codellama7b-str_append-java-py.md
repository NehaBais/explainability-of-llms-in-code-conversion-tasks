This is the equivalent code in Python:
```
string = "abc"
print(string)
string += "def"
print(string)
```
Explanation:

* In Java, the `+=` operator can be used to concatenate two strings together and assign the result to a variable. In Python, this is done using the `+=` operator, which appends one string to another and assigns the resulting string to the same variable.
* In Java, the `System.out.println()` method is used to print a string to the console. In Python, this is done using the `print()` function.
* The code in both languages declares a variable `string` and assigns it the value `"abc"`. Then, the `+=` operator is used to append the string `"def"` to the end of the `string` variable, resulting in the new value `"abcdef"`. Finally, both languages print the updated value of the `string` variable to the console using the appropriate method.
