Sure, here is a Python equivalent for your JavaScript code:

```python
s1 = "Hello"
s1 += ", World!"
print(s1)
```

In this Python script, the `+=` operator appends a string to another string variable in a way that you would expect from other languages. The result is printed with `print()`. In Python, there's no need for explicit semicolons like in JavaScript or other C-based languages. Statements are terminated by newline or some kind of statement ender (like colon).
