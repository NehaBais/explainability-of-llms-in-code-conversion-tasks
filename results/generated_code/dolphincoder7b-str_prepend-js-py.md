To convert the JavaScript code to Python, we need to do two things:

1. Create a string variable named `s` and initialize it with the value "Hello".
2. Prepend the string variable with another string literal.

Here's how to implement this in Python:
```python
s = "Hello"
s = s + ", World"
print(s)
```
This code will output the concatenated result, which is "Hello, World".
