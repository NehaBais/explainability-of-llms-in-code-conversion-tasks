 To convert the given Rust code to JavaScript, we can use Node.js and its built-in `fs` module for file system operations. Here's how you can achieve the same functionality in JavaScript:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function checkFileOrDirectory(file) {
    const fullPath = path.resolve(file);
    try {
        const stats = fs.lstatSync(fullPath);
        if (stats.isDirectory()) {
            console.log(`${file} is a directory`);
        } else {
            console.log(`${file} is a file`);
        }
    } catch (err) {
        if (err.code === 'ENOENT') { // ENOENT means "no such file or directory"
            console.log(`${file} does not exist`);
        } else {
            throw err;
        }
    }
}

const files = ["input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", "/docs"];
files.forEach(checkFileOrDirectory);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing Required Modules**: We import the `fs` and `path` modules from Node.js. The `fs` module provides methods to interact with the file system, while the `path` module helps in handling and transforming file paths.
2. **Defining the Function**: The `checkFileOrDirectory` function takes a path (file or directory) as an argument, resolves it using `path.resolve`, and then checks its existence and type using `fs.lstatSync`.
3. **Handling Errors**: If the path does not exist (`ENOENT` error), we catch the error and print that the path does not exist.
4. **Iterating Over Paths**: We define an array of paths to check, iterate over it using `forEach`, and call the function for each path.

This code will perform the same checks as the original Rust code: verifying the existence and type (file or directory) of the specified paths in both the current working directory and the filesystem root.
