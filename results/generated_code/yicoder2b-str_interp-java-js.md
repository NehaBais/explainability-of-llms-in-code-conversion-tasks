The equivalent JavaScript code for the given Java code would be: 
```javascript
let adjective = "little";
let lyric = `Mary had a ${adjective} lamb`;
```
This JavaScript version uses template literals or string interpolation features available in JavaScript. If the language does not provide these features, you can manually concatenate the variables to form the string but that will be more complex and less readable.
