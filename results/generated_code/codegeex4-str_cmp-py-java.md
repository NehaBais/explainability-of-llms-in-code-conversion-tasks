Below is the equivalent Java code for your Python program:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void compare(Object a, Object b) {
        System.out.printf("
%1$s is of type %2$s and %3$s is of type %4$s\n", 
            a, a.getClass().getName(), b, b.getClass().getName());

        if (a instanceof Comparable && b instanceof Comparable) {
            Comparable comparableA = (Comparable)a;
            Comparable comparableB = (Comparable)b;

            if (comparableA.compareTo(comparableB) < 0)
                System.out.printf("%1$s is strictly less than %2$s\n", a, b);
            if (comparableA.compareTo(comparableB) <= 0)
                System.out.printf("%1$s is less than or equal to %2$s\n", a, b);
            if (comparableA.compareTo(comparableB) > 0)
                System.out.printf("%1$s is strictly greater than %2$s\n", a, b);
            if (comparableA.compareTo(comparableB) >= 0)
                System.out.printf("%1$s is greater than or equal to %2$s\n", a, b);

            if(a.equals(b))
                System.out.printf("%1$s is equal to %2$s\n", a, b);
            if(!a.equals(b))
                System.out.printf("%1$s is not equal to %2$s\n", a, b);

            // Object identity
            if(a == b)
                System.out.printf("%1$s has object identity with %2$s\n", a, b);
            if(a != b)
                System.out.printf("%1$s has negated object identity with %2$s\n", a, b);
        } else {
            System.out.println("The objects are not comparable.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        compare("YUP", "YUP");
        compare("BALL", "BELL");
        compare(24, 123);
        compare(5.0, 5);
    }
}
```

In the Java code:

- The `compare()` method takes two generic type objects and uses reflection to get their types.
- It then checks if these objects implement the Comparable interface, which allows for comparison using its `.compareTo()` method. Note that not all objects can be compared this way - e.g., Strings and Integers are comparable, but a String and an Integer cannot be directly compared.
- The `equals()` method is used to check for object equality, while "==" checks for reference equality (i.e., if the two variables point to the same object in memory).
- This code does not cover case sensitive/in-sensitive comparison because Java's default string comparison behavior is always case-sensitive. If you want a case-insensitive comparison, you should use `equalsIgnoreCase()` method.
- The comparison of numeric strings as numbers can be done by casting them to an appropriate number type before comparing. But this is not demonstrated in the above code due to complexity and specific application requirements.

Please note that the Java language does not allow comparison between incompatible types directly (e.g., comparing a String with an Integer). The code assumes both objects are either Comparable or exactly the same type, or it will print "The objects are not comparable."
