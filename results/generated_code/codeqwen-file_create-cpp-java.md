The equivalent code in Java would be:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.nio.file.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        File f = new File("output.txt");
        f.createNewFile();

        Path dir = Paths.get("/docs");
        Files.createDirectories(dir);

        // for the current working directory, you can use:
        // Files.createDirectory(Paths.get("docs"));
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your C++ code. It creates a new file "output.txt" in the current working directory and also in the root of the filesystem, if it doesn't already exist. The `createDirectories()` function is used to create a directory (in this case a 'docs' folder) with subdirectories specified in path argument.

Please note that Java does not have equivalent functionality for creating directories on the root level due to security restrictions (unless you are running as administrator).
