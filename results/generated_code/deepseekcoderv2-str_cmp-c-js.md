## Explanation

The code is written in C. It declares functions for comparing strings using various comparison methods such as equality, inequality, and lexical ordering. The code also includes case-insensitive comparisons of strings. The main function takes command line arguments and calls the compare and comparecase functions with these arguments to demonstrate the different string comparison methods.
