Here's the Python code that meets the requirements:
```python
# Get two integers from the user
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))
# Display a message if the first integer is:
# - less than,
# - equal to, or
# - greater than the second integer.
if a < b:
 print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
elif a == b:
 print(f"{a} equals {b}")
else:
 print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```
To test the code, you can enter different integer values for `a` and `b` and check that the correct message is displayed. For example:
```
Enter the first integer: 5
Enter the second integer: 10
5 is less than 10
```
```
Enter the first integer: 10
Enter the second integer: 10
10 equals 10
```
```
Enter the first integer: 10
Enter the second integer: 5
10 is greater than 5
```
