In Golang, there is no direct equivalent of the C/C++ rename function. However, you can create a file and then overwrite it to rename it. 

Here's how you could do this in Go:

```go
package main
import (
    "os"
)
func rename(oldname string, newname string) error {
    srcfile, err := os.Open(oldname)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer srcfile.Close()

    dstfile, err := os.Create(newname)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer dstfile.Close()

    _, err = io.Copy(dstfile, srcfile)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    return srcfile.Truncate(0)
}
func main() {
    // rename "input.txt" into "output.txt" in the current working directory
    err := rename("input.txt",  "output.txt") 
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }

    // rename "docs" into "mydocs" in the current working directory
    err = os.Rename("docs",  "mydocs") 
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }

    // rename "/input.txt" into "/output.txt" in the filesystem root
    err = os.Rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt") 
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }

    // rename "/docs" into "/mydocs" in the filesystem root
    err = os.Rename("/docs",  "/mydocs") 
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }
}
```

Note that you have to run the code with the necessary permissions to perform file system operations. The above code will rename "input.txt" in the current directory to "output.txt", and then change the name of directory called "docs" to "mydocs". This is done twice - once in the current working directory, and once in the filesystem root.

This solution assumes that the input files or directories exist and are accessible for renaming. Make sure to handle the case where they don't. Also ensure you have permissions to overwrite these files/directories.
