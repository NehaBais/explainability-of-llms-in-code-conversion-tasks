The C programming language does not have built-in support for checking if a file or directory exists, unlike Java's `File` class. But we can use standard POSIX functions to achieve this. Here is the equivalent code in C:

For the current working directory: 
```c
#include <unistd.h> // For access() function

int fileExists = access("input.txt", F_OK) == 0;
int dirExists = access("docs", F_OK) == 0;
```
The `access()` function checks whether the calling process can access a file or directory named by the pathname pointed to by path. The return values are positive if the file/directory exists and zero if not. 

For the root filesystem:
Assuming you have a "/" as root, you can use similar code like this:

#include <unistd.h> // For access() function

int fileExists = access("/docs/input.txt", F_OK) == 0;
int dirExists  = access("/docs", F_OK) == 0;

Keep in mind that if you are running this code on a Windows system, it won't work because there is no root filesystem in the traditional sense of Linux or Unix. C does not provide an equivalent to Javaâ€™s `File` class for handling file I/O and directory traversal within its standard library. You would need to use POSIX functions (like those mentioned above) if you are on a system that supports them, like a Unix-based system.
