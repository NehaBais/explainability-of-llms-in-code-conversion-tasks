The Python version of the code will use built-in functions and modules os, os.path for file handling (writing/creating new files or directories) and shutil module to get file size. Please note that in a typical Unix filesystem there is no need to specify absolute paths. Relative paths should be enough.
```python
import os
import shutil

def fct(file_path):
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        print('File/Directory does not exist: ', file_path)
    else:
        print('File/Directory exists: ', file_path)

# create new empty files and directories in current working directory
files = ['output.txt', 'docs']
for f in files:
    if os.path.isdir(f):  # if it's a directory, use the mkdir() method
        try:
            os.mkdir(f)
        except OSError as error:
            print('Error creating directory', f, ': ', error)
        
        size = shutil.get_disk_usage('.')  # get current dir size
        print('Size of the directory is : ', size.used)
    else:   # if it's a file, use the open() method to create new files
        try:
            with open(f, 'w'): pass
        except OSError as error:
            print('Error creating file', f, ': ', error)
            
        size = os.path.getsize(f)  # get file size in bytes
        print('Size of the file is : ', size)
```    
Please run this script with caution on directories you have write access to as it will create new files and directories in that location. This can potentially overwrite or delete important data if not used carefully. Always ensure you understand what a script does before running it, especially scripts involving filesystem changes!
