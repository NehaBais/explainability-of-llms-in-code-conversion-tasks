Here is the Python equivalent code for your Golang code:

```python
# text assigned to a string variable
s = "hello"

# print the first string variable
print(s)

# concatenate variable and literal, assign result to another string variable
s2 = s + " literal"

# output second string variable
print(s2)
```

This Python script will perform the same operations as your Golang code. It creates a string variable, concatenates it with another string literal, and assigns the result to another string variable.
