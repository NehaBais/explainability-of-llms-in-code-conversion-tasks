Rust does not have a built-in FileSystemObject like JavaScript has, hence it cannot be used directly for file manipulations. However, similar functionality can be achieved using `std::fs` and its associated methods. Here is how you can implement the equivalent of the code:

```rust
use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::{rename, move_file, rename_file};
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let src = PathBuf::from("input.txt");
    let dest1 = PathBuf::from("output.txt");
    let dest2 = PathBuf::from("/c/output.txt");

    rename(&src, &dest1)?;
    move_file(src, dest2)?; // equivalent to MoveFile in JavaScript
    rename_file(PathBuf::from("docs"), PathBuf::from("mydocs"))?; // equivalent to MoveFolder in JavaScript
    rename_file(PathBuf::from("/c/docs"), PathBuf::from("/c/mydocs"))?; // equivalent to MoveFolder in JavaScript

    Ok(())
}
```
In Rust, `std::fs` provides a number of methods to handle file operations. The `rename` method is used to rename files and directories. The `move_file` function is used to move a file between paths, while the `rename_file` is used for renaming directories.

These methods are called with their respective source and destination path arguments, which are represented by instances of `std::path::PathBuf`. The `?` operator ensures that any error is propagated up the stack to the caller function. 

The method usage can be modified based on your requirements or use-cases. For example, you may want to handle different types of errors or perform more complex operations before returning an error. 

Please note that Rust does not have a built-in FileSystemObject like JavaScript, and it doesn't support ActiveXObject either. Therefore, we need to handle all file operations manually in our code using methods provided by `std::fs`.
