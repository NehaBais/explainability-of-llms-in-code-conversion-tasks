Sure, the code you provided is written in Golang and provides a basic operation to rename files and directories. This operation can be done both "here" (current directory) and in the filesystem root by using absolute paths. Here's how it can be converted:

```go
package main
import "os"

func main() {
  // Rename "input.txt" to "output.txt"
  if err := os.Rename("input.txt", "output.txt"); err != nil {
    println(err)
  }

  // Rename "/docs" to "/mydocs" in the filesystem root
  if err := os.Rename("/docs", "/mydocs"); err != nil {
    println(err)
  }
}
```

Please note:
- File/directory renaming operations in Go return an error if a problem occurs during the operation, so it's common to check for errors after using `os.Rename()`. This is the case with the first two lines of your original code example.
  - However, you can not rename directories or files directly on the filesystem root ("/") in Go because these paths are reserved by the operating system and they are not accessible to the program. 
  - Instead, the code above will only work if the current directory is the one containing the "input.txt" file and it's possible to write into a directory named "mydocs" (which presumably already exists).
