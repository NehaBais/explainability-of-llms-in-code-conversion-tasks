This is a simplified version of the Java code to rename files or directories, and it's not a complete solution but rather a demonstration that how the same functionality can be achieved in C++. Here's an example of how you could do it:
```cpp
#include <iostream> 
#include <cstdlib> 
#include <filesystem> 

int main() {
    try {
        // rename a file 
        std::rename("input.txt", "output.txt"); 

        // rename a directory 
        std::filesystem::rename("docs", "mydocs"); 
    } catch(const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << '\n';
    }
}
```
In this example, we first include the necessary headers and then declare a main function to handle the error cases. After that, we try to rename the file "input.txt" into "output.txt". If the rename operation fails due to an exception being thrown, we catch the exception and print out its error message. Similarly, we can replace `rename` with `filesystem::rename` for renaming directories as well.
