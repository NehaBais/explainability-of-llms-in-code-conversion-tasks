 The JavaScript code provided is using the FileSystemObject (fso) method to get the size of a file by its path. However, C++ doesn't support ActiveXObjects or scripting methods natively like JavaScript does. 

Instead, in C++, you can use functions from the `sys/stat.h` library to get the size of a file given its name. Here is how it might look:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string>

int main() {
    struct stat st;
    
    std::string path = "input.txt";   // File in the current directory
    if (stat(path.c_str(), &st) == 0 && S_ISREG(st.st_mode)) {
        std::cout << "The size of file '" << path << "' is: " << st.st_size << " bytes\n";
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Could not get information about '" << path << "'\n";
    }
    
    path = "/input.txt";  // File in the root directory
    if (stat(path.c_str(), &st) == 0 && S_ISREG(st.st_mode)) {
        std::cout << "The size of file '" << path << "' is: " << st.st_size << " bytes\n";
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Could not get information about '" << path << "'\n";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this C++ code, `stat()` function is used to obtain file status information. If the file exists and is a regular file (which can be checked with `S_ISREG(st.st_mode)`), then we print its size in bytes. If any error occurs during getting file's status or if it doesn't exist, an error message will be printed.

Please note that this code only works for Unix-like operating systems (including Linux and macOS), as the `/input.txt` path is a typical example of a root directory path in these systems. For Windows, replace `"/input.txt"` with `R"(\\?\c:\input.txt)"`.
