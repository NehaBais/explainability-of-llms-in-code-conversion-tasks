 Here's the Python equivalent of the provided C++ code:

```python
import math
import operator

def bitwise(a, b):
    print("a and b:", bin(operator.and_(a, b)))  # Using built-in `&` for AND operation
    print("a or b:", bin(operator.or_(a, b)))     # Using built-in `|` for OR operation
    print("a xor b:", bin(operator.xor(a, b)))   # Using built-in `^` for XOR operation
    print("not a:", bin(~a))                      # Using Python's bitwise NOT (~)

    # Left Shift (<<) and Right Shift (>>) operations
    print("a shl b:", bin(a << b))                # Left shift using `<<` operator
    print("a shr b:", bin(a >> b))                # Right shift using `>>` operator
    
    # Logical Right Shift (LSR), Python does not have a specific logical right shift, but we can emulate it for positive numbers
    ua = a if a >= 0 else (1 << (a.bit_length() + b)) - (1 << b)
    print("a lsr b:", bin(ua >> b))              # Logical Right Shift emulation
    
    # Left Rotate and Right Rotate, Python does not have built-in rotate functions for integers, but we can use a workaround with bit manipulation
    def left_rotate(n, d):
        return (n << d) | (n >> (32 - d)) & ((1 << 32) - 1)
    
    def right_rotate(n, d):
        return (n >> d) | (n << (32 - d)) & ((1 << 32) - 1)
    
    print("a rol b:", bin(left_rotate(a, b)))
    print("a ror b:", bin(right_rotate(a, b)))

# Example usage:
bitwise(5, 3)
```

Note:
- The Python code uses built-in bitwise operators for AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and XOR (`^`).
- For NOT operation, Python's `~` operator is used.
- Left shift and right shift operations are performed using the `<<` and `>>` operators respectively.
- Logical Right Shift (LSR) is emulated by shifting and masking to ensure only logical shifts for non-negative numbers.
- For left rotate (`rol`) and right rotate (`ror`), custom functions are defined using bit manipulation. Python's standard library does not provide built-in rotate functions for integers, so these custom implementations are used.
