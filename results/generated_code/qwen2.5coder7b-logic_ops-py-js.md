Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Python code:

```javascript
function logic(a, b) {
    console.log('a and b:', a && b);
    console.log('a or b:', a || b);
    console.log('not a:', !a);
}
```

In this function `&&` performs "and" operation, `||` performs "or" operation, and `!` performs "not" operation.
