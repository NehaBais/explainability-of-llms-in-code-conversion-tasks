 Sure! Here's how you can convert the given Go code to Python:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
s = "world!"

# Prepend the string variable with another string literal
s = "Hello, " + s

print(s)
```

This Python code does exactly what the original Go code did. It initializes a string `s` with the value "world!", then prepends "Hello, " to it and prints the result.
