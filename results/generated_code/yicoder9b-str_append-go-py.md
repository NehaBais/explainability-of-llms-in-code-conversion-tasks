Here is the equivalent Python code for your Golang program:

```python
s = "foo"
s += "bar"
print(s)
```
In this Python script, we first create a string variable `s` and assign it a value of 'foo'. Then we append the string 'bar' to `s` using the `+=` operator which concatenates the current value of `s` with 'bar'. Finally, we print out the contents of `s` after the append operation is completed.
