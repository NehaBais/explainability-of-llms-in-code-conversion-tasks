Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your C++ code:

```javascript
let original = "Mary had a X lamb.";
let toBeReplaced = "X";
let replacement = "little";

let newString = original.replace(toBeReplaced, replacement);

console.log("String after replacement: " + newString);
```

In this JavaScript version of the code, we're using `replace()` function which is equivalent to the C++ `replace()`. This function replaces a specified value with another value in a string. In our case, it's replacing 'X' with 'little'.
