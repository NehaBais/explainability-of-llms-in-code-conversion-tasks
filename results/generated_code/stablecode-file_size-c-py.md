Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
import os

# Get file size for files in current directory
file_path_current = "input.txt"
if os.path.exists(file_path_current):
    print(os.path.getsize(file_path_current)))
else:
    print("The file '{}' does not exist.".format(file_path_current))


# Get file size for files in root directory
root_directory = "/"
file_path_root = "input.txt"
full_path = os.path.join(root_directory, file_path_root))
if os.path.exists(full_path):
    print(os.path.getsize(full_path)))
else:
    print("The file '{}' does not exist in the root directory.".format(file_path_root)))
```
This Python code replicates exactly the functionality of the original C code. It verifies the size of a file called input.txt for files in the current working directory, and another one in the file system root directory.
