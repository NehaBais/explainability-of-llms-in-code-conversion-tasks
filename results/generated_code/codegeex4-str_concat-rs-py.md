Sure, here is how you can convert this Rust code to Python:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
s = "hello"

print(s)

# Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal
s1 = s + " world"

print(s1)
```

This Python code does exactly what your Rust code does: it first declares and prints a string variable `s` equal to `"hello"`, then it creates another string `s1` by concatenating `s` with the string `" world"` and finally prints `s1`.
