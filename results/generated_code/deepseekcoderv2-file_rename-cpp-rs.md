 To convert the given C++ code to Rust, we need to use Rust's standard library for file operations, which includes functions like `std::fs::rename` for renaming files and directories. Here is how you can achieve the same functionality in Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Rename input.txt to output.txt in the current working directory
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").expect("Failed to rename file");
    
    // Rename docs to mydocs in the current working directory
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").expect("Failed to rename directory");
    
    // Rename /input.txt to /output.txt in the filesystem root (assuming a Unix-like system)
    fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt").expect("Failed to rename file");
    
    // Rename /docs to /mydocs in the filesystem root (assuming a Unix-like system)
    fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs").expect("Failed to rename directory");
}
```

In this Rust code:
1. We use `std::fs::rename` for renaming files and directories, with `.expect("Failed to rename file")` to handle any potential errors gracefully.
2. The paths are provided as string literals (`"input.txt"`, `"output.txt"`, etc.), which should work correctly assuming the code is run on a Unix-like filesystem where absolute paths starting with `/` are valid. If you're running this on Windows, you would need to use backslashes for directory separators (`\`) and adjust the paths accordingly.
3. The `.expect("Failed to rename file")` part ensures that if any of the renaming operations fail (which shouldn't happen in a controlled environment like this), the program will print an error message and exit gracefully.
