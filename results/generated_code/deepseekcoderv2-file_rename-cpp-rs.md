### Answer

Here is the Rust code:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").expect("Failed to rename file");
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").expect("Failed to rename directory");
    fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt").expect("Failed to rename file in root");
    fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs").expect("Failed to rename directory in root");
}
```
