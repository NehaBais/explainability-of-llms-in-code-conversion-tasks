This is the equivalent Python code:
```python
s = "World"
s = "Hello " + s
print(s)
```
In Python, we don't need to use `.to_string()` or `insert_str` methods like in Rust. The line of code `let mut s  =  "World".to_string();` can be simplified into just `s = "World"`. And the remaining operations on `s` can be performed directly by concatenating the string literals `"Hello "` and `s` using the `+` operator.
