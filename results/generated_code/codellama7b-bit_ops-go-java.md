This code is a Go program that performs various bitwise operations on two integers. The program first imports the "fmt" package for printing values and uses the "int16" type to represent the input values.

Here's the Java version of this code:
```
public class BitwiseOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define two integers
        int a = -460;
        int b = 6;
        
        // Perform bitwise logical operations
        System.out.println("a:   " + Integer.toBinaryString(a));
        System.out.println("b:   " + Integer.toBinaryString(b));
        System.out.println("and: " + (a & b));
        System.out.println("or:  " + (a | b));
        System.out.println("xor: " + (a ^ b));
        System.out.println("not: " + ~a);
        
        // Perform bitwise shifts and rotates
        if (b < 0) {
            System.out.println("Right operand is negative, but all shifts require an unsigned right operand (shift distance).");
            return;
        }
        int ua = a;
        int ub = b;
        
        System.out.println("shl: " + (ua << ub));
        System.out.println("shr: " + (ua >> ub));
        System.out.println("las: " + ((ua << ub) & 0xffff));
        System.out.println("ras: " + ((ua >> ub) & 0xffff));
        
        // Perform rotations
        System.out.println("rol: " + (((ua << ub) | (int)((unsigned int)a >> (16 - ub))) & 0xffff));
        System.out.println("ror: " + (((int)(uint)a >> ub) | ((ua << (16 - ub)) & 0xffff)));
    }
}
```
Note that the Java code uses the "int" type to represent the input values, and it uses the "&" operator for bitwise AND, the "|" operator for bitwise OR, and the "^" operator for bitwise XOR. The "~" operator is used for bitwise NOT, and the "<<" and ">>" operators are used for bitwise shifts and rotates.

The Java code also uses the "Integer.toBinaryString(int i)" method to convert an integer value to its binary representation as a string. This is useful for printing the results of the bitwise operations in a more readable format.
