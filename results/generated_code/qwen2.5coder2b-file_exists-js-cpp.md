The equivalent C++ code for the above JavaScript code would look something like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <sys/stat.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Create a new instance of the filesystem object
    const char* fileSystemName = "Scripting.FileSystemObject";
    IFileSystemObject* fso = CreateObject(fileSystemName);
    if (!fso) {
        cerr << "Could not create FileSystemObject." << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // File and Directory Verification for current working directory
    string currentDirectoryPath = ".";

    try {
        fso->FileExists(currentDirectoryPath + "\\input.txt");
        fso->FolderExists(currentDirectoryPath + "\\docs");
    } catch (const char* exception) {
        cerr << "Error verifying files and directories in the current directory: " << exception << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // File and Directory Verification for root of the filesystem
    try {
        fso->FileExists("input.txt");
        fso->FolderExists("docs");
    } catch (const char* exception) {
        cerr << "Error verifying files and directories in the system root: " << exception << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Release the FileSystemObject
    fso->Release();

    return 0;
}
```

Please note, the code above uses COM object model for file operations. C++ does not have a native equivalent to ActiveXObject or IFileSystemObject. If you're using Windows, you should consider using Boost::filesystem library instead of COM objects.

Also, there are some security implications when working with files and directories in the root directory, as it allows applications to modify system files and directories without the user's permission. It is recommended to only perform such operations in a controlled environment where necessary.
