Sure, here is the equivalent code in Python:

```python
# In python, strings are created with either single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").
s = "hello"  # This is a string variable equal to any text value.
print(s + ' literal') # Concatenate another string literal with the original string variable. 

# The output will be: hello literal
```
The same operation is performed, but in Python code. It prints out the contents of variables and then the result of concatenating two strings.
