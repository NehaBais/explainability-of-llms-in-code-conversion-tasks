Sure! Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given Rust code snippet:
```javascript
function main() {
 // only same types can be compared
 // String and String or &str and &str
 // exception: strict equality and inequality also work on &str and String
 let a = 'abc';
 let b = 'Bac';

 // Strings are coerced to &str when borrowed and needed
 if (a === b) {
 console.log('The strings are equal');
 } else {
 console.log('The strings are not equal');
 }
 if (a > b) {
 console.log('The first string is lexically after the second');
 } else if (a < b) {
 console.log('The first string is lexically before the second');
 } else {
 console.log('The two strings are equal lexicographically');
 }

 // case-insensitives:

 // equality
 // this avoids new allocations
 if (a.toLowerCase() === b.toLowerCase()) {
 console.log('Both strings are equal when ignoring case');
 } else {
 console.log('The strings are not equal when ignoring case');
 }

 // everything else, create owned Strings, then compare as above
 let a2 = a.toUpperCase();
 let b2 = b.toUpperCase();

 if (a2 > b2) {
 console.log('The first string is lexically after the second');
 } else if (a2 < b2) {
 console.log('The first string is lexically before the second');
 } else {
 console.log('The two strings are equal lexicographically');
 }
}
```
In JavaScript, we can compare two strings using the `===` operator for strict equality, the `>` and `<` operators for lexical comparison, and the `toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()` methods to perform case-insensitive comparisons. The code snippet demonstrates how to perform string comparisons in Javascript using the same type system as Rust.
