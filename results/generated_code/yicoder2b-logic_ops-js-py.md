Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for the given JavaScript function. 

```python
def logic(a,b):
    print('a AND b:', a and b)
    print('a OR b:', a or b)
    print('NOT a:', not a)
```
This Python function does exactly the same thing as the given JavaScript one. It takes two boolean values `a` and `b`, performs logical operations on them (and, or) and also negates (`not`) one of them.
