Sure! Here's the code in Rust that accomplishes what you need:
```rust
use std::{fs, io};
fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
 fs::File::create("input.txt")?;
 fs::File::create("/input.txt")?;
 fs::create_dir("docs")?;
 fs::create_dir("/docs")?;
 Ok(())
}
```
This code uses the `fs` module from the standard library to create files and directories. The `?` operator is used to handle any errors that may occur during file or directory creation, and the `Ok(())` at the end indicates a successful execution of the program.
