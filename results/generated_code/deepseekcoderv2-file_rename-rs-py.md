 Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for the given Rust code:

```python
import os

def main():
    err = "File move error"
    try:
        os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"{err}: {e}")
    
    try:
        os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"{err}: {e}")
    
    try:
        os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"{err}: {e}")
    
    try:
        os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"{err}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code performs the same operations as the Rust code, renaming files and directories in both the current working directory and the filesystem root. The `os.rename` function is used to rename the files and directories, and error handling is included to print an error message if a file cannot be renamed.
