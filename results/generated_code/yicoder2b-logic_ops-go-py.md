Sure, here's how you can convert this code from Go to Python:

```python
def printLogic(a, b):
    print("a and b is", (a and b))
    print("a or b is", (a or b))
    print("not a is", not a)
```
Note that the Go language doesn't have an equivalent of Python's "!" operator for negating a boolean value. In this Python code, it's equivalent to using the `not` keyword before `a`.
