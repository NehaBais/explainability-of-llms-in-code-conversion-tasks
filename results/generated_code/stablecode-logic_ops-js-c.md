Below is the JavaScript code converted to C language. Note that standard boolean, int and char types are used in C for this logic function equivalent. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void logic(int a, int b) {
    printf("a AND b: %d\n", (a && b)));
    printf("a OR b: %d\n", (a || b))));
    printf("NOT a: %d\n", (!a)));
}
```
Please note that in C, the boolean value is represented as int type which can be either 0 or 1. The logical operators &&(and), ||(or) and !(not) are standard operators provided by C language. 

The above code equivalent to your requirement.
