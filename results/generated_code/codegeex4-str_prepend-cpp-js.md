Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your C++ code:

```javascript
const myStrings = ["prepended to", "my string"];
const prepended = myStrings.join("");
console.log(prepended);
```

This JavaScript code does exactly what your original C++ program does. It creates an array called `myStrings` with two elements, then joins them together into a single string, and finally prints that string to the console.
