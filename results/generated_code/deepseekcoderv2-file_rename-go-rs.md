 Certainly! Below is the equivalent Rust code for the provided Go program, which renames files and directories as specified in the requirements:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Rename in the current working directory
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").expect("Failed to rename input.txt to output.txt");
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").expect("Failed to rename docs to mydocs");
    
    // Rename at the filesystem root
    fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt").expect("Failed to rename /input.txt to /output.txt");
    fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs").expect("Failed to rename /docs to /mydocs");
}
```

This Rust code uses the `fs::rename` function from the standard library to perform the renaming operations. The `.expect()` method is used to handle potential errors, although it's assumed that the user has the necessary permissions to rename files and directories in both cases.
