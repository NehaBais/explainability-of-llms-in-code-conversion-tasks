Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your Python program.

```JavaScript
let s1 = "hello";
console.log(s1 + " world");

let s2 = s1 + " world";
console.log(s2);

s1 = "hello";
console.log([s1, "world", "mom"].join());

let s3 = [s1, "world", "mom"].join();
console.log(s3);
```
This will print the same output as your Python program. The '+' operator is used for string concatenation in JavaScript and the join() method joins all elements of an array into a string. It is called without any arguments to produce a comma-separated string from the array elements by default.
