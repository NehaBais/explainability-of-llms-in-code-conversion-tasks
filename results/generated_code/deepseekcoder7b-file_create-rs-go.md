Below is the equivalent GoLang code for your Rust snippet. This program creates an empty file and a directory in two places - the current working directory (".") and the root of the filesystem ("/"). 

Please note that to create directories or files at different locations we can use `os` package's functions like `Mkdir()` for creating a directory and `Create()` for creating an empty file. This package is available in Go by default, so you don't need any import statement to include it.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

const (
	fileName = "output.txt"
	dirName  = "docs"
)

func main() {
	err := create(".")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error: %v\n", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	err = create("/")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error: %v\n", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

func create(root string) error {
	filePath := fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s", root, fileName)
	dirPath := fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s", root, dirName)
	err := os.MkdirAll(dirPath, 0755)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	_, err = os.Create(filePath)
	return err
}
```

Please note that creating a file at the root of filesystem ("/") or any other arbitrary location might require super user privileges and may be blocked by many security systems, as it's generally not considered good practice to write sensitive data directly into the root directory. Be careful with file and folder creation operations! Also remember, "/" is just an example here; you need a correct path according to your operating system.
