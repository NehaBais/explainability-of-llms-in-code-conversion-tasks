Here is the equivalent code in Rust:

```rust
fn logic(A: bool, B: bool) {
    println!("A AND B: {}", A && B);
    println!("A OR B: {}", A || B);
    println!("NOT A: {}", !A);
}
```

This code takes in two boolean values (A and B), performs the corresponding logic operations, and prints out the results. Note that Rust uses `{}` to print formatted strings, which is similar to C++'s `printf`.
