Here's the C code that accomplishes the task you described:
```c
#include 
int main() {
 rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
 rename("docs", "mydocs");
 rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
 rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
 return 0;
}
```
Note that this code assumes that the user has the necessary permissions to modify files and directories in both the current working directory and the root filesystem. Also, it may not work on all systems, as the behavior of the `rename()` function can vary depending on the operating system.
