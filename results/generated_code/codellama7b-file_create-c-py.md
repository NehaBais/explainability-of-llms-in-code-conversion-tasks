To convert the code from C to Python, you can use the following function:
```
import os
import stat

def main():
    # Create an empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory called "docs".
    with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
        pass
    
    # Create the directory "docs" with permissions 0750 for rwxr-x---
    os.mkdir("docs", stat.S_IRWXU | stat.S_IRGRP | stat.S_IXGRP | stat.S_IROTH)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This function uses the `open` function in Python to create an empty file with write permissions and the `mkdir` function to create a directory with custom permissions. The `stat` module is used to define the permissions for the directory, which are set using the bitwise OR operator (`|`). The resulting permissions will be `0750`, which means the owner has read, write, and execute permission, and the group and others have only read and execute permission.
