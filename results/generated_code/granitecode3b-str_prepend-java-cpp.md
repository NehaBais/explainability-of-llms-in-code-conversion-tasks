Here's the equivalent C++ code:
```
#include 
int main() {
 std::string string = "def";
 string = "abc" + string;
 return 0;
}
```
Note that in C++, strings are enclosed in double quotes (`"`), while in Java they are enclosed in single quotes (`'`). Also, unlike Java, C++ does not have a separate data type for booleans. Instead, it uses the `bool` keyword to represent true and false values.
