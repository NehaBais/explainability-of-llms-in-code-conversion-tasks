Here's the equivalent function in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func printLogic(a bool, b bool) {
    fmt.Printf("a and b is %d\n", a && b))
    fmt.Printf("a or b is %d\n", a || b))
    fmt.Printf("not a is %d\n", !a))
}
```
This Go version of the function works exactly like the original C code, handling boolean logic operations as required.
