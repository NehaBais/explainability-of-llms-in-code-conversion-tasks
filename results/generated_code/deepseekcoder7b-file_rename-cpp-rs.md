Here is the equivalent Rust code for your C++ program, using std::fs library to handle file and directory renaming:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io::Error;

fn main() {
    match fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt") {
        Ok(_) => println!("Renamed 'input.txt' to 'output.txt' in current directory"),
        Err(e) => println!("Error renaming file: {}", e),
    };
    
    match fs::rename("docs", "mydocs") {
        Ok(_) => println!("Renamed 'docs' to 'mydocs' in current directory"),
        Err(e) => println!("Error renaming dir: {}", e),
    };
    
    match fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt") {
        Ok(_) => println!("Renamed '/input.txt' to '/output.txt' at root"),
        Err(e) => println!("Error renaming file: {}", e),
    };
    
    match fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs") {
        Ok(_) => println!("Renamed '/docs' to '/mydocs' at root"),
        Err(e) => println!("Error renaming dir: {}", e),
    };
}
```

This Rust code does the same thing as your C++ code. It attempts to rename "input.txt" and "docs" in the current working directory, and "/input.txt" and "/docs" at the root of the filesystem. If any of these operations fail for whatever reason (usually because the file or directory doesn't exist), it prints an error message instead.
