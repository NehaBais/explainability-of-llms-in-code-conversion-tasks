Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ code that checks if the files and directories exist, both in the current working directory and in the filesystem root:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <filesystem>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

int main() {
    // Check for input.txt in the current working directory and the filesystem root
    checkFile("input.txt");
    
    // Check for /input.txt in the filesystem root
    checkFile("/input.txt");

    // Check for docs directory in the current working directory and the filesystem root
    checkDirectory("docs");
    
    // Check for /docs directory in the filesystem root
    checkDirectory("/docs");

    return 0;
}

void checkFile(const std::string& path) {
    if (fs::exists(path)) {
        if (fs::is_regular_file(path)) {
            std::cout << "File: " << path << " exists and is a regular file.\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "File: " << path << " exists but is not a regular file.\n";
        }
    } else {
        std::cout << "File: " << path << " does not exist.\n";
    }
}

void checkDirectory(const std::string& path) {
    if (fs::exists(path)) {
        if (fs::is_directory(path)) {
            std::cout << "Directory: " << path << " exists and is a directory.\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "Directory: " << path << " exists but is not a directory.\n";
        }
    } else {
        std::cout << "Directory: " << path << " does not exist.\n";
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Namespace**: We use `std::filesystem` to handle file and directory operations.
2. **Check Functions**:
   - `checkFile`: Checks if a given path is a regular file.
   - `checkDirectory`: Checks if a given path is a directory.
3. **Main Function**: 
   - Calls `checkFile` for both `input.txt` in the current working directory and `/input.txt`.
   - Calls `checkDirectory` for both `docs` in the current working directory and `/docs`.

### Note:
- The filesystem root varies depending on the operating system. In Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS), it is typically `/`, while in Windows, it can be different.
- Ensure you have the `<filesystem>` header available in your C++ environment. This is part of the C++17 standard library, so make sure your compiler supports C++17 or later.

Compile and run this code with a C++17 compliant compiler to verify the existence of files and directories.
