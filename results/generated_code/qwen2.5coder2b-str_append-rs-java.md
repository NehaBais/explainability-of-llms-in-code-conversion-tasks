To convert the Rust code to Java, you would use `String` in place of `std::ops::Add`, and you would call `append()` method instead of `add()`. Here's how the equivalent Java code would look:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String hello = "Hello world";
        hello += "!!!!";
        System.out.println(hello);
    }
}
```
The output will be:

Hello world!!!!
