#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    string currentWorkingDir = ".";
    string rootDir = "/";
    string inputFile = "input.txt";
    string outputFile = "output.txt";
    string docsDir = "docs";
    string myDocsDir = "mydocs";

    // Rename files and directories in current working directory
    rename(currentWorkingDir + "/" + inputFile, currentWorkingDir + "/" + outputFile);
    rename(currentWorkingDir + "/" + docsDir, currentWorkingDir + "/" + myDocsDir);

    // Rename files and directories in root directory
    rename(rootDir + "/" + inputFile, rootDir + "/" + outputFile);
    rename(rootDir + "/" + docsDir, rootDir + "/" + myDocsDir);

    return 0;
}
```
This code uses the `rename` function from `<stdio.h>` to rename files and directories in the current working directory and the root directory. The `string` data type is used to store the file and directory names as strings, which are then concatenated with the directory separator (`/` or `\`) to form the complete file paths.

The code first renames the input file "input.txt" into "output.txt" in both the current working directory and the root directory using the `rename` function. Then it renames the "docs" directory into "mydocs" in both the current working directory and the root directory using the `rename` function.

Note that the `rename` function returns a value of type `int`, which is then ignored in this code. This is because the `rename` function does not return any information about whether the operation was successful or not. If you want to check if the operation was successful, you can use the `errno` variable to check for errors.
