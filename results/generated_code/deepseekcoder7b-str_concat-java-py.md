The equivalent Python code for the given Java program is as follows -

```python
# Assigning string variable
s = "hello"
print(s + " literal")  # Printing concatenated string

# Concatenating with another string literal and assigning it to a new string variable
s2 = s + " literal"
print(s2)   # Printing the newly formed string
```
This code will produce the same output as your Java program. The `+` operator is used in Python for concatenation of strings, just like in Java.
