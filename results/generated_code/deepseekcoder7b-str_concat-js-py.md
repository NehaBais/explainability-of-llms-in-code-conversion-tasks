Sure, here's how you can do this in Python instead:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value.
s = "hello"

# Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal.
t = s + " there!"

# Show the content of the variables.
print(s)  # prints: hello
print(t)  # prints: hello there!
```
