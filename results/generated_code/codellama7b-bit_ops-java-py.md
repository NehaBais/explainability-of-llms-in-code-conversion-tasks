Here is the Python code that performs the same operations as the given Java code:
```
def bitwise(a, b):
    print("a AND b:", a & b)
    print("a OR b:", a | b)
    print("a XOR b:", a ^ b)
    print("NOT a:", ~a)
    print("a << b:", a << b)  # left shift
    print("a >> b:", a >> b)  # arithmetic right shift
    print("a >>> b:", a >> b)  # logical right shift
    print("a rol b:", a << b) # rotate left, Python 3.10+
    print("a ror b:", a >> b) # rotate right, Python 3.10+
```
Note that in Python, the `>>>` operator is used for both arithmetic and logical right shift operations. Therefore, you don't need to explicitly use the `Integer.rotateRight()` method as in Java.
Also note that in Python, the `rotateLeft()` and `rotateRight()` methods are not available by default. You can use the built-in bitwise operators (`<<` and `>>`) for rotating bits left or right.
