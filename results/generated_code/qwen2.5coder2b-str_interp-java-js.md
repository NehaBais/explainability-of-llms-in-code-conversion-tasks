Sure! Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your given Java example:

```javascript
let adjective = "little";
let lyric = `Mary had a ${adjective} lamb`;
console.log(lyric);
```

In this JavaScript code, we define two variables: `adjective` with the value `"little"`, and `lyric` which uses template literals (backticks ``) for string interpolation. The `${adjective}` inside the string interpolates the value of `adjective` into the string "Mary had a X lamb". Finally, we log the result to the console using `console.log`.
