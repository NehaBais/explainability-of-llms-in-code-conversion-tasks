Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task:
```python
s = "hello"
print(s, "literal")
s2 = s + " literal"
print(s2)
```
The output of this code will be:

hello literal
helloworld literal

As you can see, the string variable `s` is created and assigned the value "hello", and then a new string variable `s2` is created and assigned the value of `s` concatenated with the string literal "literal". The output shows both variables.
