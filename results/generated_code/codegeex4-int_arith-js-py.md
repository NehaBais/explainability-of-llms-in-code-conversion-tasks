You can use Python's built-in input function to get two integers from the user. Then, you can perform various arithmetic operations on these integers and print their results. Below is the equivalent Python code:

```python
import sys

# Get command line arguments
a = int(sys.argv[1])
b = int(sys.argv[2])

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
division = a / b
remainder = a % b

# Print results
print(f'a + b = {sum}')
print(f'a - b = {difference}')
print(f'a * b = {product}')
print(f'a / b = {division} (Round towards nearest)')
print(f'a % b = {remainder} (Remainder will have the sign of the first operand if they are different)')
```
In Python, division of two integers yields a float even if the quotient is an integer. The `%` operator always produces the remainder after dividing `b` into `a`. If both operands are positive or negative, it returns a result with the same sign as the first operand. If they have different signs, it can return a negative value, depending on the specific implementation of Python.
