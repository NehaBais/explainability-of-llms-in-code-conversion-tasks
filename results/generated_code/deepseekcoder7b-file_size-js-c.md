To convert JavaScript code to C, you need a way of determining the size of files in C. This can be done using the `stat()` function from the unistd.h library in C which provides information about file status. 

Here is your translated code in C with error handling included:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    struct stat st; 

    // Verify the size of a file called input.txt for current working directory
    if (stat("input.txt", &st) == 0) {
        printf("Size of 'input.txt' in current working directory: %ld\n", st.st_size);
    } else {
        printf("Cannot get size of file input.txt for current working directory");
    } 
    
    // Verify the size of a file called input.txt for root file system
    if (stat("/home/user/input.txt", &st) == 0) { // replace "/home/user/input" with your path to 'input.txt' in filesystem root
        printf("Size of 'input.txt' at the root of file system: %ld\n", st.st<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>t_size);
    } else {
        printf("Cannot get size of file input.txt for root of file system");
    } 
    
    return 0;
}
```
Replace "/home/user/input.txt" with the actual path to 'input.txt' in your filesystem root directory before compiling and running this C program.
