Here is the equivalent Python code to perform these operations:

```python
import os
import shutil

# Rename here (in current working directory)
os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
os.rename("docs", "mydocs")

# Rename in filesystem root
shutil.move('C:/Users/UserName/Desktop/output.txt', 'C:/')
shutil.move('C:/Users/UserName/Desktop/mydocs', 'C:/')
```

Note: 
1) Replace `'C:/Users/UserName/Desktop/'` with the actual path of your current working directory in Windows, and `'/'` with root directory ("/" on Linux systems).
2) The Python script will work only if you run it from its own location because it uses absolute paths. Adjust as per your requirements.
