The C++ code you provided is designed to concatenate multiple strings together using `std::accumulate` from the `<algorithm>` library. However, in this specific case, you only have two strings that need to be concatenated.

Here's how you can achieve the same result in Python:

```python
# Define the initial string and the string to prepend
initial_string = "my string"
prepend_string = "prepended to"

# Concatenate the strings using the '+' operator
result = prepend_string + initial_string

# Print the result
print(result)
```

This Python code does the following:
1. It defines two string variables: `initial_string` and `prepend_string`.
2. It concatenates these two strings using the `+` operator, which is straightforward in Python.
3. Finally, it prints the concatenated result.

When you run this code, it will output:

prepended tomy string

This mimics the behavior of your C++ code but with a more straightforward approach in Python.
