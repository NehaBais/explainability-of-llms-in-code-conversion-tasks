Sure! Here's the JavaScript code for the same functionality:
```
const fs = require('fs');

// Current working directory
let size = fs.statSync('./input.txt').size;

// File system root
size = fs.statSync('/input.txt').size;
```
In this code, we use the `fs` module to interact with the file system in Node.js. The `statSync()` method is used to retrieve information about a file, including its size. We then assign the size of the file to the `size` variable.

Note that the `'./'` prefix in the path for the current working directory is used to specify that the file should be searched in the current working directory, while the `'/'` prefix specifies an absolute path from the root of the file system.
