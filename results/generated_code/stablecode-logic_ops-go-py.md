Here's how you can write the equivalent function in Python:

```python
def print_logic(a, b):
    print("a and b is", a and b)
    print("a or b is", a or b)
    print("not a is", not a)
```
This Python function `print_logic` works in the exact same way as your Golang function. It takes two boolean arguments, performs "and" operation between 'a' and 'b', performs "or" operation between 'a' and 'b', also performs "not" operation on argument 'a'. All these operations are performed and printed inside this function.
