In Python, string concatenation is done using the '+' operator rather than WriteString method in Golang. Here is how it can be converted to Python -

```python
s = "foo"
s += "bar"
print(s)
```
This code creates a new string variable s and assigns it the value of "foo". Then it appends the string "bar" to the end of s, making its final value "foobar". The print statement then outputs this concatenated string.
