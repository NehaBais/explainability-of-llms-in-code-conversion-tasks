 The equivalent code in Python would be:

```python
import os
import shutil

# here
shutil.move('input.txt', 'output.txt')
shutil.move('/input.txt', '/output.txt') # '/' denotes the filesystem root on Unix-based systems (including MacOS and Linux)
shutil.move('docs/', 'mydocs/') 
shutil.move('/docs/', '/mydocs/')
```

Note:

1. You should be careful when moving files/folders to a different disk root because you might need administrator rights or special permissions.
2. The `/` denotes the root of your filesystem, so `/input.txt` and `/output.txt` means "from the root directory take input.txt" and move it into output.txt from the root. 
3. For moving a file or folder in Python, `shutil` is recommended as it's standard library and more reliable than creating an ActiveXObject (which isn't available in Python). `os` module provides some low-level functions for handling files, but itâ€™s mainly used for changing current directory, listing directories, etc. 
4. You need to have the required permissions to perform these operations.
