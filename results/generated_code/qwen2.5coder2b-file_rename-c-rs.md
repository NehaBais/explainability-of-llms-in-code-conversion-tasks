To convert the given C code to Rust, you can use the `fs` crate for file operations. Here is the equivalent Rust code:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Rename in current directory
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs");

    // Rename in root directory
    fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
}
```

Make sure to add the `fs` crate to your `Cargo.toml` file:

[dependencies]
fs = "0.3"

This code will rename the files and directories as required in the Rust version of the program.
