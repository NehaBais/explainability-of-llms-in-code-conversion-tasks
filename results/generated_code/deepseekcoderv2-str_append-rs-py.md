 Certainly! Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Rust code:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
hello = "Hello world"

# Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way
hello += "!!!!"

# Show the contents of the variable after the append operation
print(hello)
```

This Python code does the following:
1. Initializes a string variable `hello` with the value `"Hello world"`.
2. Appends `"!!!!"` to the existing string using the `+=` operator, which is idiomatic in Python for string concatenation.
3. Prints the contents of the updated string.
