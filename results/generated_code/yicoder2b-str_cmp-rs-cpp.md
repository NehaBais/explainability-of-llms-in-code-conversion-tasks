This problem is asking to convert the given Rust code into C++. For the purpose of this conversion, we only need to include the relevant header file for ASCII functions in order to make case insensitive comparisons work.

The provided Rust code is demonstrating string comparison which can be done with 'String' and '&str' types. The language treats these differently when it comes to memory management (coercion). In C++, we manually handle the memory allocation and deallocation of 'std::string' objects compared to passing 'const char*' or other raw pointers directly.

This is a simple conversion:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cctype>   // for std::toupper, std::tolower 
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string a("abc");  // String
    string b = "Bac"; // String
    if (a == b) printf("The strings are equal\n");
    else if (a < b) printf("The first string is lexically after the second\n");
    else if (b < a) printf("The first string is lexically before the second\n");

    // Case-insensitive comparison
    string a_upper = a;  // To ensure no memory leak, create a copy of 'a'
    for (auto& c : a_upper) {
        c = toupper(c);
    }
    if (a_upper == b) printf("Both strings are equal when ignoring case\n");
    else if (b < a_upper) printf("The first string is lexically after the second when ignoring case\n");
    else if (a_upper < b) printf("The first string is lexically before the second when ignoring case\n");
}
```
Please note, C++ also doesn't provide strict inequality checks like Rust, but it does provide non-equality checking operation with '!=' operator.
