In Rust, you can use the `std::fs` module to handle file system operations. The `create_dir_all` function in particular is what you would use for creating a directory and any missing parents. Here's how you can implement this in Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path;

fn mkdirp(p: &str) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
    let p = path::Path::new(&p);

    if !p.exists() {
        fs::create_dir_all(p)?;
    }

    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    let dir = "path/to/dir";
    mkdirp(dir).unwrap(); // handle errors
}
```

In this code, we first create a `Path` instance from the input string `p`. Then, we check if the directory exists using `exists` method. If it doesn't exist, we use `create_dir_all` to create it and any missing parents. We then return `Ok(())`, indicating success. If an error occurs during the process (such as a permission denied), we return that error.

This will create the directory and any missing parents, if they don't already exist.
