 To convert the provided JavaScript code to C++, we need to follow these steps:

1. Read two integers from the command line arguments.
2. Calculate and display their sum, difference, product, integer quotient, remainder, and exponentiation.
3. Handle the rounding for division (towards zero).
4. Determine the sign of the remainder based on the signs of the operands.

Here's the equivalent C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib> // For std::atoi

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if (argc != 3) {
        std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <a> <b>" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    int a = std::atoi(argv[1]);
    int b = std::atoi(argv[2]);

    // Calculate the results
    int sum = a + b;
    int difference = a - b;
    int product = a * b;
    
    // Integer quotient (C++ division rounds towards zero)
    int quotient = a / b;
    
    // Remainder
    int remainder = a % b;
    
    // Exponentiation (not directly supported in C++, you might need to use a library or custom function)
    double exponentiation = std::pow(a, b);

    // Output the results
    std::cout << "a + b = " << sum << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a - b = " << difference << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a * b = " << product << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a / b = " << quotient << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a % b = " << remainder << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a ^ b (exponentiation) = " << exponentiation << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Command Line Arguments**: We use `std::atoi` to convert command line arguments from strings to integers. If the number of arguments is not exactly 3, we print a usage message and exit with an error code.
2. **Calculations**:
   - **Sum**: Direct addition using the `+` operator.
   - **Difference**: Direct subtraction using the `-` operator.
   - **Product**: Direct multiplication using the `*` operator.
   - **Integer Quotient**: Division is performed directly, which in C++ rounds towards zero for integer division.
   - **Remainder**: Using the modulus (`%`) operator, which gives the remainder of the division.
   - **Exponentiation**: We use `std::pow` from the `<cmath>` library to calculate exponentiation. However, note that this is a floating-point operation and might need adjustment based on requirements (e.g., handling large exponents).
3. **Output**: Results are printed using `std::cout`.

This code assumes basic command line input and output, typical for many CLI applications in C++. Adjustments may be needed depending on specific environment constraints or requirements not covered by this template.
