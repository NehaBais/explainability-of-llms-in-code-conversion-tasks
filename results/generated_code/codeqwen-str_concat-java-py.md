Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
def main():
    s = "hello"
    print(s, "literal")
    s2 = s + " literal"
    print(s2)

main()
```

This Python script will perform the same task as your Java program. It creates a string variable `s` and assign it to the value "hello". Then it concatenates `s` with the string " literal" and stores the result in `s2`. The contents of all variables are then printed out.
