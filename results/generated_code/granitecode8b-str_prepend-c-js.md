Here is the converted code from C to JavaScript:
```javascript
let str = "my String";
str = "Changed " + str;
console.log(str);
```
The output of this code will be:

Changed my String

This code creates a string variable `str` with the value `"my String"`. Then, it prepends the string variable with another string literal `"Changed "` using concatenation. Finally, it prints the resulting string to the console.
