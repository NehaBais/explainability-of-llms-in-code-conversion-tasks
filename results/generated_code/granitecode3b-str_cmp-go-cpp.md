Here's the equivalent C++ code that demonstrates how to compare two strings from within the language and how to achieve a lexical comparison:
```
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
 string c = "cat";
 string d = "dog";
 if (c == d) {
 cout << c << " is bytewise identical to " << d << endl;
 } else {
 cout << c << " is bytewise different from " << d << endl;
 }
 if (c > d) {
 cout << c << " is lexically bytewise greater than " << d << endl;
 } else if (c < d) {
 cout << c << " is lexically bytewise less than " << d << endl;
 } else {
 cout << c << " is lexically bytewise equal to " << d << endl;
 }
 if (strings::lexicographical_compare(c.begin(), c.end(), d.begin(), d.end()) == 0) {
 cout << c << " is lexically bytewise greater than or equal to " << d << endl;
 } else if (strings::lexicographical_compare(d.begin(), d.end(), c.begin(), c.end()) == 0) {
 cout << c << " is lexically bytewise less than or equal to " << d << endl;
 } else if (c < d) {
 cout << c << " is lexically bytewise less than " << d << endl;
 } else if (c > d) {
 cout << c << " is lexically bytewise greater than " << d << endl;
 } else {
 cout << c << " is lexically bytewise equal to " << d << endl;
 }
 return 0;
}
```
This code uses the `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` operators to compare two strings in Golang. It also uses the `strings::lexicographical_compare` function from the `strings` library to perform a lexical comparison between two strings. The code also demonstrates how to achieve case insensitive comparisons using the `strings::equal_to` function, which performs a case-insensitive comparison between two strings.
