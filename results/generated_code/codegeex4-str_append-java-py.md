```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
string = "abc"
print(string)

# Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way
string += "def"

# Show the contents of the variable after the append operation
print(string)
```
In Python, there is no need to declare data types explicitly. The `+=` operator is used to concatenate strings in a similar way as in Java, and print statements are used to display output.
