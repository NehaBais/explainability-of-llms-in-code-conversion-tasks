In Rust, you can use the `std::fs` module to achieve similar functionality. Here is how you might translate your C++ code into Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let current_path = Path::new("./");
    let root_path = Path::new("/");

    create_file_and_directory(&current_path);
    create_file_and_directory(&root_path);
}

fn create_file_and_directory(path: &Path) {
    // Create an empty file
    if fs::File::create(path.join("output.txt")).is_err() {
        eprintln!("Failed to create 'output.txt' in {:?}", path);
    }

    // Create a directory named "docs"
    if fs::create_dir(path.join("docs")).is_err() {
        eprintln!("Failed to create 'docs' in {:?}", path);
    }
}
```

This Rust program will attempt to create an empty file and an empty directory named "docs" both in the current working directory and at the filesystem root. If there is any error during these operations, it will print a message indicating which operation failed. Note that creating files or directories with names like "output.txt" and "docs" at the filesystem root might require appropriate permissions and may not be allowed on some systems.
