JavaScript doesn't have a built-in module to deal with paths and directories like Python does, but the same functionality can be accomplished using Node.js `fs` (file system) and `path` modules. 

Here is an equivalent JavaScript code for your Python script which uses async/await pattern:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises; // node v14+, use fs in node v12-
const path = require('path');

async function checkFileAndDirectoryExists(filePath) {
  try {
    const stat = await fs.stat(filePath);
    
    if (await fs.access(filePath)) { // checks file or directory existence
      console.log("The path " + filePath  + " exists");
      
      if (stat.isFile()) {
        console.log("The path " + filePath + " is a file.");
      } else if (stat.isDirectory()) {
        console.log("The path " + filePath +  " is a directory.");
      } 
    }
    
  } catch(err) {
    console.error('Error occurred while accessing the provided path: ', err);
  }
}

// Calling function for current working dir and root dir files/directories
checkFileAndDirectoryExists("./input.txt"); // relative to cwd (current working directory)
checkFileAndDirectoryExists("/input.txt"); // from filesystem root
checkFileAndDirectoryExists("./docs");  // relative to cwd
checkFileAndDirectoryExists("/docs");   // from filesystem root
```
In the above code, we're using `fs.stat()` and `fs.access()` promises which resolve when their associated system calls have completed successfully. The first argument passed to both functions is a file path that you want to verify the existence for. If it exists, its type (whether directory or regular file) will be determined by stat method, else error will be thrown with an appropriate message in catch block. 

Remember: In JavaScript running on Node.js environment, if the file or directory is not found at root path('/'), you might encounter "permission denied" error because of user's permission level required to access files and directories at root(/) path. You may need to run your script with administrative/root privileges.
