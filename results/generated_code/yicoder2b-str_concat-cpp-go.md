Sure, here is the equivalent code in Golang:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    s := "hello"
    fmt.Println(s, "literal")
    s2 := s + " literal"
    fmt.Println(s2)
}
```

Please note that in Golang, you need to manually handle string concatenation unlike C++ where it can be done directly with the '+' operator. Also remember to import necessary packages for using 'fmt' function to print the output.
