The JavaScript code is almost identical to the Python one, except we use node.js's `fs` (file system) module to create files and directories instead of Python's built-in functions for file handling. The following JavaScript code does essentially the same thing as your provided Python code - creates an empty file "output.txt" in the current working directory and an empty folder "docs":

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function create(directory) {
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(directory, 'output.txt'), '');
    fs.mkdirSync(path.join(directory, 'docs'));
}

create(".");  // current directory
create("/");  // root directory (this may not work as expected on all platforms)
```
Note: JavaScript runs in a client's web browser or node.js server, it doesnâ€™t have an absolute way to know what the root directory is without knowing the specific environment and platform where this code will be running. Passing `"/"` (the root directory in Linux/OSX) works for example but not on windows because Windows does not use a "/" for its file system structure.
