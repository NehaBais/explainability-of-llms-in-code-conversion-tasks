Here's the equivalent Java code:
```
String s = "Hello World";
System.out.println(s);
```
Note that in Java, strings are immutable, so we cannot directly modify an existing string variable like we can in Rust. However, we can concatenate a new string to the original one using the `+` operator or the `StringBuilder` class.
