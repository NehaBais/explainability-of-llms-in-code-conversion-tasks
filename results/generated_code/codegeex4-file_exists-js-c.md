The JavaScript code provided uses the Windows Script Host Object Model, specifically for Microsoft's Windows environment. In contrast, the C language does not support such file system operations directly because it is a low-level language. You would need to use system calls or libraries available in your specific operating system.

Below, you will find examples for checking if a file and directory exist using POSIX functions in UNIX-like environments (such as Linux or macOS) and Windows API in C/C++. These are not direct translations but demonstrate how to achieve similar functionality in the respective environments. 

For the POSIX version:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    // Check for input.txt in current directory
    if (access("input.txt", F_OK) != -1)
        printf("File 'input.txt' exists in current directory.\n");
    else
        printf("File 'input.txt' does not exist in current directory.\n");

    // Check for input.txt in filesystem root
    if (access("/input.txt", F_OK) != -1)
        printf("File 'input.txt' exists at filesystem root.\n");
    else
        printf("File 'input.txt' does not exist at filesystem root.\n");

    // Check for docs in current directory
    if (access("docs", F_OK) != -1 && access("docs", R_OK | X_OK) == 0)
        printf("Directory 'docs' exists and is readable/executable in current directory.\n");
    else
        printf("Directory 'docs' does not exist or isn't readable/executable in current directory.\n");

    // Check for docs in filesystem root
    if (access("/docs", F_OK) != -1 && access("/docs", R_OK | X_OK) == 0)
        printf("Directory 'docs' exists and is readable/executable at filesystem root.\n");
    else
        printf("Directory 'docs' does not exist or isn't readable/executable at filesystem root.\n");

    return 0;
}
```

For the Windows API version:

#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Check for input.txt in current directory
    if (GetFileAttributes("input.txt") != INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES)
        printf("File 'input.txt' exists in current directory.\n");
    else
        printf("File 'input.txt' does not exist in current directory.\n");

    // Check for input.txt in filesystem root
    if (GetFileAttributes("\\\\?\\C:\\input.txt") != INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES)
        printf("File 'input.txt' exists at filesystem root.\n");
    else
        printf("File 'input.txt' does not exist at filesystem root.\n");

    // Check for docs in current directory
    if (GetFileAttributes("docs") != INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES)
        printf("Directory 'docs' exists in current directory.\n");
    else
        printf("Directory 'docs' does not exist in current directory.\n");

    // Check for docs in filesystem root
    if (GetFileAttributes("\\\\?\\C:\\docs") != INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES)
        printf("Directory 'docs' exists at filesystem root.\n");
    else
        printf("Directory 'docs' does not exist at filesystem root.\n");

    return 0;
}

These examples are simplistic and assume that the user has the necessary permissions to access these files and directories. Note that `access()` in POSIX version and `GetFileAttributes` in Windows API version both check for file existence but not if a directory is readable or executable, which may be required depending on your application's requirements. Additional checks might need to be added accordingly.
