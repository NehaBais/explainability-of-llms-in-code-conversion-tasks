In Rust, you can use the `std::string` type to represent strings, which provides a set of methods for comparing them. Here's an example of how you could implement the code in Rust:
```
use std::string;

fn main() {
    let c = "cat";
    let d = "dog";

    // Exact equality comparison
    if c == d {
        println!("{} is bytewise identical to {}", c, d);
    } else {
        println!("{} is bytewise different from {}", c, d);
    }

    // Lexical ordering comparison
    if c > d {
        println!("{} is lexically bytewise greater than {}", c, d);
    } else if c < d {
        println!("{} is lexically bytewise less than {}", c, d);
    } else {
        println!("{} is lexically bytewise equal to {}", c, d);
    }

    // Case-insensitive comparison with the `to_lowercase()` method
    if c.to_lowercase() == d.to_lowercase() {
        println!("{} is case-insensitively identical to {}", c, d);
    } else {
        println!("{} is case-insensitively different from {}", c, d);
    }
}
```
In Rust, the `std::string` type provides a set of methods for comparing strings, including exact equality and lexical ordering. The `to_lowercase()` method can be used to perform a case-insensitive comparison.

It's worth noting that in Rust, you cannot directly compare a value of string type to a value of numeric type, because the language is strongly typed and does not support implicit conversions between different types. However, you can use the `to_string()` method to convert a string to a number, or use a library like `num_strings` that provides additional string-related functionality.
