In Python, you can use the `os` module to accomplish this:

```python
import os

def main():
    err = "File move error"
    os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
    os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
    
    try:
        os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
    except OSError as e:
        print(err)
        
    try:
        os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
    except OSError as e:
        print(err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python script behaves similarly to the original Rust code. It attempts to rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" and "docs" to "mydocs" in the current working directory, then it tries to do this again starting from the root of the filesystem (assuming you have permissions to do so). If there's an error, it prints out an error message but does not terminate.
