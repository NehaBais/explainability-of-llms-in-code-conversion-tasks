Here is the Java code that accomplishes the same task as the Rust code:
```java
String hello = "Hello world";
hello += "!!!!";
System.out.println(hello);
```
The `+=` operator concatenates the string literal `"!!!!"` to the end of the `hello` variable, resulting in the value `"Hello world!!!"`. The output of this code will be: `Hello world!!!`
