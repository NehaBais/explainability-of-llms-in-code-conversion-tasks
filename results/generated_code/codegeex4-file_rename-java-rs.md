```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn rename_file(old_name: &str, new_name: &str) -> bool {
    let file = Path::new(old_name);
    let file2 = Path::new(new_name);
    fs::rename(&file, &file2).is_ok()
}

fn test(type_: &str, oldname: &str, newname: &str) {
    let action = if rename_file(oldname, newname) { "was renamed as" } else { "could not be renamed into" };
    println!("The following {} called {} {} {}", type_, oldname, action, newname);
}

fn main() {
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
    test("file", "/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs");
    test("directory", "/docs/", "/mydocs/");
}
```
In this code:

1. We import the required Rust modules: `std::fs` for file system operations and `std::path::Path` to manipulate paths.
2. We define a function `rename_file` that accepts two arguments, both of type `&str`, representing the old and new names of the file or directory respectively.
3. In this function, we create `Path` objects from the old and new names, then attempt to rename the file/directory using `fs::rename`. The result is checked for success with `.is_ok()`.
4. We define a function `test` that accepts a type string (`&str`), an old name (`&str`) and a new name (`&str`). It uses the `rename_file` function to try and rename the file/directory, then prints out the result.
5. In the main function, we call `test` with the corresponding arguments for files and directories in both the current working directory and the filesystem root.

Please note that you need to run this script with appropriate privileges as renaming system-wide files might require administrative access depending on the system settings.
