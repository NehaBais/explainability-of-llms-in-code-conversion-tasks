Below is the equivalent C code to perform these operations using the stdio for file operations and dirent library for directory operations. The code might need root permissions to move files/directories in filesystem roots, you can use sudo or run as administrator accordingly based on your OS settings. 
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dirent.h> 
  
int main() {
    // Rename a file from current directory to another name
    rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    
    // Move a file from current directory to root directory 
    // Please run this program with sudo or as administrator for the below operation 
    rename("c:/input.txt", "/output.txt"); 
  
    // Rename a directory from current directory to another name
    rename("docs", "mydocs");
      
    // Move a directory from current directory to root directory 
    // Please run this program with sudo or as administrator for the below operation 
    rename("c:/docs", "/mydocs"); 
  
    return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>0;
}
```
NOTE: This code will not work in an interpreted environment like a web browser, it's intended to be used on a local machine where you have access to perform these operations. If you are attempting to achieve this within the context of some other application or system (like Windows service), please provide more specific details and I can help with that as well.
