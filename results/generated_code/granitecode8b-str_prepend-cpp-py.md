Here is the Python code that meets the requirements:
```
my_strings = ["prepended to", "my string"]
prepended = "".join(my_strings)
print(prepended)
```
This code creates a list of two strings, "prepended to" and "my string", and then uses the `join()` method to concatenate them into a single string. The resulting string is stored in the variable `prepended`, which is then printed to the console.
