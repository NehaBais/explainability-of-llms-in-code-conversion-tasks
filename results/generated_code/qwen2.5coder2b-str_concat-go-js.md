Sure, here is the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
function main() {
    // text assigned to a string variable
    let s = "hello";

    // output string variable
    console.log(s);

    // this output requested by original task descrption, although
    // not really required by current wording of task description.
    console.log(s + " literal");

    // concatenate variable and literal, assign result to another string variable
    let s2 = s + " literal";

    // output second string variable
    console.log(s2);
}

main();
```

Please note that JavaScript is case-sensitive, so `s` and `S` would be considered different variables. Also, there are no built-in methods for concatenating strings in JavaScript like `+`.
