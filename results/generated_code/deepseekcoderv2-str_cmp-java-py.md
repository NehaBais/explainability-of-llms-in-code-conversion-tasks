 Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
def compare(A, B):
    if A == B:
        print(f"'{A}' and '{B}' are lexically equal.")
    else:
        print(f"'{A}' and '{B}' are not lexically equal.")
    
    if A.lower() == B.lower():
        print(f"'{A}' and '{B}' are case-insensitive lexically equal.")
    else:
        print(f"'{A}' and '{B}' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.")
    
    if A < B:
        print(f"'{A}' is lexically before '{B}'.")
    elif A > B:
        print(f"'{A}' is lexically after '{B}'.")
    else:
        print(f"'{A}' and '{B}' are lexically equal in terms of order.")
    
    if A <= B:
        print(f"'{A}' is not lexically after '{B}'.")
    elif A >= B:
        print(f"'{A}' is not lexically before '{B}'.")
    
    comparison = (A > B) - (A < B)
    print(f"The lexical relationship is: {comparison}")
    
    case_insensitive_comparison = (A.lower() > B.lower()) - (A.lower() < B.lower())
    print(f"The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: {case_insensitive_comparison}")

# Test cases
compare("Hello", "Hello")
compare("5", "5.0")
compare("java", "Java")
compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ")
compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĵãvá")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Equality and Inequality Comparison**:
   - In Python, the `==` operator is used for exact equality comparison.
   - The `!=` operator can be used for inequality comparison.

2. **Lexical Order Comparison**:
   - In Python, string comparison uses lexicographical order (`<`, `>`, etc.).
   - For case-insensitive comparisons, you can convert strings to lowercase using the `.lower()` method before comparing them.

3. **Case Insensitive Equality**:
   - You can compare two strings in a case-insensitive manner by converting both strings to lowercase and then using the equality operator (`==`).

4. **Lexical Order Comparison in Python**:
   - The comparison operators `<`, `>`, etc., directly apply to strings for lexicographical order.
   - For case-insensitive comparisons, you can use the `.lower()` method on both strings before comparing them.

5. **Numeric String Comparison**:
   - If numeric strings are not treated lexically (e.g., "10" is considered less than "2" because of lexicographical order), Python will handle this based on string comparison, which may not be the intended behavior for numerical comparisons.
   - For proper numerical comparisons, you should convert them to appropriate numeric types before comparing (e.g., using `int()` or `float()`).

This Python code mirrors the functionality of the provided Java code by demonstrating various string comparisons and handling different cases as specified.
