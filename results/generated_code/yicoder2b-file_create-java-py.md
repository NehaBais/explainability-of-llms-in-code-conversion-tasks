The equivalent Python code for the given Java code is:
```python
import os

class CreateFileTest:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def create_file():
        with open('output.txt', 'wb') as f:
            pass
        os.mkdir("docs")
        os.mkdir('/docs')
```
Note that the Python code uses the built-in modules `os` and `io` which provide file manipulation functions. The `with open` statement is used to create a context manager, which automatically calls `close()` on the file when done with it, regardless of what happens inside the block. The `os.mkdir()` function creates a directory if it does not already exist.

The output file "output.txt" is created in both the current working directory (here) and at the filesystem root. Similarly, "docs" directory is also created in both. 

This code won't print any error message unlike Java version because Python doesn't have the concept of exceptions. However, if you still want to handle errors differently for more control over your flow, you can add a try-except clause around `os.mkdir()`.
