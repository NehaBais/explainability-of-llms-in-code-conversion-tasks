Here's the equivalent Python code that meets the requirements:
```python
s1 = "Hello"
s1 += ", World!"
print(s1)
```
In Python, we use the `+=` operator to append a string literal to a variable. The above code creates a string variable `s1` with the value `"Hello"`, appends the string literal `, World!` to it using the `+=` operator, and then prints the contents of `s1` after the append operation.
