Here's how you can convert the given Rust code to Python. 

In Python, we will use the `os` and `stat` modules for this task:

```python
import os
import stat

def check_file(path):
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        print(f"{path} does not exist.")
    else:
        try:
            info = os.stat(path)
            print(f"{path} is a file of size {info.st_size} bytes.")

            if stat.S_ISDIR(info.st_mode):
                print(f"{path} is a directory.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed to check {path}. Error: {str(e)}")


def main():
    # Current working directory
    current = os.getcwd()
    check_file(os.path.join(current, "input.txt"))
    check_file(os.path.join(current, "docs"))

    # File and directory in the filesystem root
    root = os.path.join(os.sep * ("", ""), "input.txt"))
    root_dir = os.path.join(os.sep * ("", ""), "docs"))
    check_file(root)
    check_file(root_dir)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This Python code will perform the same checks as the given Rust code. It first checks if a file and a directory exist in the current working directory and root of the filesystem, respectively. For each check, it prints whether the specified path is a file or a directory, along with any additional information about the file or directory (e.g., its size in bytes). If an error occurs during the check, it prints an error message indicating what went wrong.
