Answer: 
The provided C++ code is a program that demonstrates the comparison of two strings in different ways. The main function takes in two arguments, which are treated as strings and compared using various string functions. The output includes information about whether the strings are equal, unequal, lexically ordered before or after each other, and numerically if they can be converted to numbers.

To convert this code into Golang, we need to first understand the function of each part of the C++ code and then implement them in Golang. 

In Golang, strings are represented using the `string` type, which is a sequence of bytes with UTF-8 encoding. To compare two strings for equality or inequality, use the `==` and `!=` operators respectively. For lexical comparison between two strings, you can use the `strings.Compare()` function, which returns an integer value indicating whether string A comes before (negative) string B or after (positive) string B lexicographically:

```go
// Compare two strings for exact equality
func compareStrings(a, b string) bool {
    return a == b
}

// Compare two strings for inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality)
func compareStringInEquality(a, b string) bool {
    return !compareStrings(a, b)
}

// Compare two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other
func compareLexicalOrderBeforeAfter(a, b string) (bool, bool) {
    cmp := strings.Compare(a, b)
    return cmp < 0, cmp > 0
}

// Compare two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after than the other
func compareLexicalOrderAfterBefore(a, b string) (bool, bool) {
    cmp1, cmp2 := compareLexicalOrderBeforeAfter(b, a)
    return !cmp1, !cmp2
}
```

To achieve both case sensitive comparisons and case insensitive comparisons within the language, you can use the `strings.EqualFold()` function:

// Compare two strings for exact equality (case-sensitive)
func compareStringsCaseSensitive(a, b string) bool {
    return a == b
}

// Compare two strings for inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality) (case-sensitive)
func compareStringInEqualityCaseSensitive(a, b string) bool {
    return !compareStringsCaseSensitive(a, b)
}

// Compare two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other (case-sensitive)
func compareLexicalOrderBeforeAfterCaseSensitive(a, b string) (bool, bool) {
    cmp := strings.Compare(a, b)
    return cmp < 0, cmp > 0
}

// Compare two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after than the other (case-sensitive)
func compareLexicalOrderAfterBeforeCaseSensitive(a, b string) (bool, bool) {
    cmp1, cmp2 := compareLexicalOrderBeforeAfterCaseSensitive(b, a)
    return !cmp1, !cmp2
}


To handle comparison of numeric strings if they are not treated lexically, you can use the `strconv.Atoi()` function to convert the strings to integers and then compare them as numbers:

// Compare two strings for exact equality (numeric)
func compareStringsNumeric(a, b string) bool {
    num1, err := strconv.Atoi(a)
    if err != nil {
        return false
    }
    num2, err := strconv.Atoi(b)
    if err != nil {
        return false
    }
    return num1 == num2
}

// Compare two strings for inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality) (numeric)
func compareStringInEqualityNumeric(a, b string) bool {
    return !compareStringsNumeric(a, b)
}

Additionally, you can define a function to handle both case sensitive and case insensitive comparisons for strings:

// Compare two strings for exact equality (both case-sensitive and case-insensitive)
func compareStringsCaseSensitiveAndInSensitive(a, b string) bool {
    return strings.EqualFold(a, b)
}

// Compare two strings for inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality) (both case-sensitive and case-insensitive)
func compareStringInEqualityCaseSensitiveAndInSensitive(a, b string) bool {
    return !compareStringsCaseSensitiveAndInSensitive(a, b)
}

These functions should provide the required functionality for both case sensitive comparisons and case insensitive comparisons within the language.
