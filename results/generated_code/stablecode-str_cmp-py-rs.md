Rust does not provide direct comparison operators for all possible string types and ordering relations. 

For example, a `String` in Rust can contain any Unicode character (including emojis), so comparing strings lexicographically using the `<` operator would not always make sense because it doesn't consider the Unicode properties of characters.

In contrast, when comparing numeric strings (like "123" and "24") as if they were numbers, Rust provides direct comparison operators (`<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`) that work correctly with numeric strings.

However, these comparison operators are not used to compare strings lexicographically in Rust. Instead, Rust provides several ways to perform string comparisons that consider the Unicode properties of characters:

1. **Using the `cmp` module**: The `cmp::Ordering` enum can be used to compare two strings for exact equality or to check if one string is lexically ordered before/after another string. Here's an example:

```rust
use cmp::Ordering;

fn compare_strings(a: &str, b: &str) {
    match a.cmp(b) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("{} is strictly less than {}", a, b),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("{} is equal to {}", a, b),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("{} is strictly greater than {}", a, b),
    }
}

compare_strings("YUP", "YUP");
compare_strings("BALL", "BELL");
compare_strings("24", "123");
```

2. **Using the `str` module**: The `str::cmp` method can be used to compare two strings for exact equality or to check if one string is lexically ordered before/after another string. Here's an example:

    ```rust
    use str::FromStr;

    fn compare_strings(a: &str, b: &str) {
        match (a.parse(), b.parse()) {
            (Ok(a)), (Ok(b))) => println!("{} is equal to {}", a, b),
            (Ok(a)), (Err(_))) => println!("{} is not equal to {} because the second string cannot be parsed as an integer", a, b)),
            (Err(_)), (Ok(b))) => println!("{} is not equal to {} because the first string cannot be parsed as an integer", a, b)),
            _ => ()
        }
    }

    compare_strings("YUP", "YUP");
    compare_strings("BALL", "BELL");
    compare_strings("24", "123");
    ```

3. **Using the `str::starts_with` and `str::ends_with` methods**: These methods can be used to check if a string starts with or ends with a specific substring, respectively. Here's an example:

    ```rust
    fn compare_strings(a: &str, b: &str) {
        if a == b {
            println!("{} is equal to {}", a, b);
        } else if a.starts_with(b) {
            println!("{} starts with the prefix \"{}\"", a, b);
        } else if a.ends_with(b) {
            println!("{} ends with the suffix \"{}\"", a, b));
        } else {
            println!("{} is not equal to {} or does not start with/end with the specified prefix/suffix, respectively.", a, b));
        }
    }

    compare_strings("YUP", "YUP");
    compare_strings("BALL", "BELL");
    compare_strings("24", "123");
    ```

Note that these comparison methods can be used to compare strings for exact equality or to check if one string is lexicographically ordered before/after another string. However, these methods may not work correctly with all possible string types and ordering relations due to the complexities of Unicode character properties.
