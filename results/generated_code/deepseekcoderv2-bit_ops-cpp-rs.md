 Certainly! Below is the Rust equivalent of the provided C++ code. In Rust, we need to handle all the bitwise operations and shifts/rotates as specified:

```rust
fn bitwise(a: i32, b: i32) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a & b);
    println!("a or b:  {}", a | b);
    println!("a xor b: {}", a ^ b);
    println!("not a:   {}", !a);
    
    // Note: the C/C++ shift operators are not guaranteed to work if the shift count (that is, b)
    // is negative, or is greater or equal to the number of bits in the integer being shifted.
    println!("a shl b: {}", a << b); // Note: "<<" is used both for output and for left shift
    println!("a shr b: {}", a >> b); // typically arithmetic right shift, but not guaranteed
    
    let ua = a as u32;
    println!("a lsr b: {}", ua >> b); // logical right shift (guaranteed)
    
    // There are no rotation operators in Rust, but we can implement them using shifts.
    // For left rotate and right rotate, we need to define our own functions.
    let rol = |x: u32, n: u32| -> u32 { (x << n) | (x >> (32 - n)) };
    let ror = |x: u32, n: u32| -> u32 { (x >> n) | (x << (32 - n)) };
    
    println!("a rol b: {}", rol(ua, b as u32));
    println!("a ror b: {}", ror(ua, b as u32));
}

fn main() {
    let a = 0b1010; // Example value for a
    let b = 3;      // Example value for b
    bitwise(a, b);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Bitwise Operations**: Rust uses the same operators (`&`, `|`, `^`) as C++ for bitwise operations. The `!` operator is used for bitwise NOT.
2. **Shift Operators**: In Rust, the shift operators are `<<` and `>>`. For logical right shift (similar to C++'s unsigned right shift), we cast the integer to `u32` before shifting.
3. **Rotation Operations**: Rust does not have built-in rotation operators like C++. We define custom functions for left rotate (`rol`) and right rotate (`ror`) using bitwise shifts.
4. **Main Function**: The `main` function initializes the values of `a` and `b` and calls the `bitwise` function to perform the operations.

This Rust code should provide equivalent functionality to your original C++ code.
