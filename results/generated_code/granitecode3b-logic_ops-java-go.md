Sure, here's the equivalent code in Golang:
```go
func logic(a, b bool) {
 fmt.Println("a AND b: ", a&&b)
 fmt.Println("a OR b: ", a||b)
 fmt.Println("NOT a: ", !a)
}
```
Note that the syntax for logical operators and the "!" operator is different in Golang compared to Java, but the logic of the code remains the same.
