 Certainly! Below is the equivalent Rust code for the provided C code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut str = String::from("my String");
    let cstr = "Changed ";
    
    // Prepend the string with another string literal
    str = format!("{}{}", cstr, str);
    
    println!("{}", str);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **String Initialization**: In Rust, `String` is used to represent a mutable string. We initialize it with the value "my String".
2. **String Literal**: A string literal `"Changed "` is defined as `cstr`.
3. **Formatting**: The `format!` macro is used to concatenate `cstr` and `str`, effectively prepending `cstr` to `str`.
4. **Printing**: The final concatenated string is printed using `println!`.

This Rust code performs the same operations as the original C code, including creating a mutable string, appending another string to it, and then printing the result.
