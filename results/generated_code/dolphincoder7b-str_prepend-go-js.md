JavaScript does not have direct equivalents for Golang's variables or operators; however, we can use JavaScript's object-oriented programming capabilities and the "+" operator to accomplish similar tasks. Here is an example of how you might write this in JavaScript:
```javascript
let s = "world!";
s = `Hello, ${s}`;
console.log(s); // Outputs "Hello, world!"
```
In this code, I use a template literal (backticks) to include the value of the variable `s` within the string. The `${}` syntax is used to insert the variable's value into the string. This way, we can achieve the same result as in Golang with minimal syntax changes and no need for any additional libraries or modules.
