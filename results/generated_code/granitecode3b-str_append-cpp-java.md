Here's the Java code that performs the same operations as the given C++ code:
```java
public class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  String greeting = "Hello";
  greeting += ", world!";
  System.out.println(greeting);
 }
}
```
The Java code creates a string variable named `greeting` and initializes it with the value "Hello". It then appends the string literal ", world!" to the end of the `greeting` variable using the `+=` operator, which is equivalent to the C++ code's `.append()` method. Finally, the contents of the `greeting` variable are printed to the console using `System.out.println()`.
