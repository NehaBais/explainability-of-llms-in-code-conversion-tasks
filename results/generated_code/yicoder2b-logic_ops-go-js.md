The equivalent JavaScript code for the given Golang code would be -
```javascript
function printLogic(a, b) {
    console.log('a and b is', (a && b));
    console.log('a or b is', (a || b));
    console.log('not a is', !a);
}
```
Please note that JavaScript uses "&&" for logical "and" operation and "||" for logical "or" operation. The "!" operator is used to get the logical negation of a boolean value (i.e., true becomes false and vice versa).
