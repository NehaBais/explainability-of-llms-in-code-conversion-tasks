To convert the Rust code to Python, you can use the following code:
```python
hello = "Hello world"
print(hello + "!!!!")
```

Here's a breakdown of the conversion:

- In Rust, we used `String::from` to create a new string variable `hello` and then added another string literal using the `add` method.
- In Python, we directly use the `+` operator to concatenate two strings together.
