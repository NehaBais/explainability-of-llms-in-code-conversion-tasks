The equivalent JavaScript code for the given C code would be:

```javascript
let a = prompt('Enter first number');
let b = prompt('Enter second number');

if (a < b) {
  console.log(`${a} is less than ${b}`);
}
else if (a == b) {
  console.log(`${a} is equal to ${b}`);
} 
else {
  console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b}`);
}
```
This code will ask the user for input, check each condition separately and print out a message based on which condition was met first.
