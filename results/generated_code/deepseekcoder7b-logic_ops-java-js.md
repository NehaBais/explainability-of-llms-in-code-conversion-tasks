Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Java code:

```javascript
function logic(a, b) {
    console.log('a AND b: ' + (a && b));
    console.log('a OR b: ' + (a || b));
    console.log('NOT a: ' + (!a));
}
```
This function takes two arguments `a` and `b`, both of which should be boolean values. It then prints out the results of applying the logical operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to these variables in the same way as your Java code does. 

Please note that JavaScript uses `&&` instead of `and` for AND operation, `||` instead of `or`, and `!` instead of `not` for NOT operation. This is a language specific difference between Java and JavaScript. It's quite different from the way you asked in your question (`System.out.println` versus `console.log`), but it's one of those things that gets used to when you switch languages!
