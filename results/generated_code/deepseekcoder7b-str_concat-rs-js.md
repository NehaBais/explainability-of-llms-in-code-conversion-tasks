Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Rust code:

```JavaScript
let s = "hello".toString();
console.log(s);
  
let s1 = s + " world";
console.log(s1);
```

This script defines a string variable `s` and assigns it the value of the string literal `"hello"`. It then prints out this value using `console.log()`. 

Next, another string variable `s1` is declared whose value is obtained by concatenating `s` with the string literal `" world"`. The result is printed to the console as well.
