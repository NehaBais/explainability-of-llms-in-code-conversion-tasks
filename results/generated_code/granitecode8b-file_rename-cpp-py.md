Here's the Python code that achieves the same requirement as the given C++ code:
```python
import os
# Rename a file in the current working directory
os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
# Rename a directory in the current working directory
os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
# Rename a file in the root directory (i.e., /)
os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
# Rename a directory in the root directory (i.e., /)
os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
```
Note that the `os` module in Python provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality, such as renaming files and directories. The code above works on both Windows and Unix-based systems.
