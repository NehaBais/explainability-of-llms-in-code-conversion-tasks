Your code snippet already contains C++, but here's it in a more complete format with comments. This code will verify whether the file `input.txt` and directory `docs` exist relative to the current working directory or the root filesystem respectively. If these files/directories don’t exist then they won’t be created by this program.
```cpp
// Header Files
#include <iostream>                         // for std::cout, std::endl
#include <fstream>                          // for std::ifstream
#include <sys/stat.h>                       // for stat() function

bool check_file(const char* path)  {        // Function to check file existence
    struct stat buffer;                     // buffer to hold info about the file or directory
    return (stat(path, &buffer) == 0);      // check if file/dir exists and get its info into 'buffer' variable. Return true on success, false otherwise.
} 

bool check_directory(const char* path) {     // Function to check directory existence
    struct stat buffer;                     
    return (stat(path, &buffer) == 0 && S_ISDIR(buffer.st_mode)); // Check if file/dir exists and it is a directory. Return true on success, false otherwise.
} 

int main() {
    std::cout << "input.txt is a regular file? " <<  (check_file("input.txt") ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;            // Check current working directory for input.txt and print result.
    std::cout << "docs is a directory? " <<  (check_directory("docs") ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;                  // Check current working directory for docs and print result.
    
    std::cout << "/input.txt is a regular file? " <<  (check_file("/input.txt") ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;         // Check root filesystem for /input.txt and print result.
    std::cout << "/docs is a directory? " <<  (check_directory("/docs") ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;               // Check root filesystem for /docs and print result.
    
    return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>0;                              // Returning an int value to match the standard of main function in C++. The correct return value should be 0, indicating successful termination of program execution.
}
```
Remember that these checks are not absolute: a directory may still contain a file named `input.txt` or there could exist another directory named `docs` at different location than the one you intended to check. Be sure that paths provided as arguments match exactly what you expect, including case sensitivity and any symbolic links involved.
