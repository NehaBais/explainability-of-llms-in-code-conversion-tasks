Here is the equivalent Python code for your Rust program:

```python
s = "hello"
print(s)

s1 = s + " world"
print(s1)
```

In this Python code, we first declare a string variable `s` and assign it with the value of "hello". Then print its content to the standard output. We then create another string variable `s1`, set it equal to the concatenation of `s` and the string literal " world". Finally, we print the content of `s1` to illustrate the operation.
