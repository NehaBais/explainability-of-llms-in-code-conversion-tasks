This Rust version closely follows the Java version for all aspects of the string comparison functionality. We still have the main function to call `compare` with various pairs of strings, and `compare` itself contains all the comparisons. 

Some differences are because Rust uses `&str` instead of `String`, as references are more common in Rust. Also, comparing a string that is not ASCII will result in an error.

For case insensitive comparisons (`eq_ignore_ascii_case()`) and getting lowercase version of a string (`to_lowercase()`), Rust provides additional functions. The `cmp` function compares two strings lexicographically. If the first string is less than the second one it returns `Ordering::Less`, if they are equal then it returns `Ordering::Equal`, and if the first string is greater than the second one it returns `Ordering::Greater`. We can then print these results using their string representations (`to_string()`) to match the Java output.
