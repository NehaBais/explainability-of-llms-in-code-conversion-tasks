 The equivalent Python code for the given Golang program would be as follows:

```python
import os

def rename_files():
    try:
        # Rename file in current working directory
        os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
        os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
        
        # Rename files at root level
        os.rename("/root/input.txt", "/root/output.txt")
        os.rename("/root/docs", "/root/mydocs")
    except OSError as e:
        print(f"Error occurred while renaming the files: {e}")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    rename_files()
```
This script will attempt to rename the file named `input.txt` into `output.txt` and directory called `docs` into `mydocs`, both in the current working directory, as well as at the root level under `/root`. If any error occurs during this process, it will print an error message.
