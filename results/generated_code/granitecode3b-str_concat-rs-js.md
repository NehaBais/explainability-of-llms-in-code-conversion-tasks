Sure! Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given Rust code snippet:
```javascript
let s = 'hello';
console.log(s);
let s1 = s + ' world';
console.log(s1);
```
The output of this JavaScript code will be:

hello
hello world

As you can see, the variables `s` and `s1` contain the same string value as in the Rust code snippet. The only difference is that the string values are enclosed within single quotes instead of double quotes in JavaScript.
