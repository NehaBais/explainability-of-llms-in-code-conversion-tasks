Here is the equivalent Python code for your C code:

```python
# Prepend the string variable with another string literal.
def prepend_string():
    # Create a string variable equal to any text value.
    my_str = "my String"

    # Another string literal
    prepend_str = "Changed "

    # Combine my_str and prepend_str
    result = prepend_str + my_str

    print(result)

# Call the function
prepend_string()
```
Please note that Python's `str.format()` or f-strings (Python 3.6+) are generally preferred for string formatting instead of the C style sprintf. This is because they provide better readability and their usage is more idiomatic in Python.
