Here's the Python code that performs the same task as the given Java code:
```
adjective = "little"
lyric = f"Mary had a {adjective} lamb"
```
In this Python code, we use f-strings (formatted strings literals) to perform string interpolation. The curly braces {} are used to enclose the variable `adjective`, which will be replaced by its value when the f-string is evaluated. The result of the evaluation is a new string with the adjective interpolated into the original string.
