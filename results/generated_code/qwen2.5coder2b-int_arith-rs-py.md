Sure, here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
# Get the input from user
a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate and print the results
print("Sum:", a + b)
print("Difference:", a - b)
print("Product:", a * b)
print("Integer Quotient:", a // b)  # truncates towards zero
print("Remainder:", a % b)
```

In this Python code, I used `int(input(...))` to get input from the user as integers. The integer division operator `/` is used for integer quotient calculation and the modulus operator `%` gives us the remainder.
