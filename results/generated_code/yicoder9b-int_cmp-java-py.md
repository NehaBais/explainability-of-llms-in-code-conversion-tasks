Here's the equivalent Python code for your Java program: 

```python
num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())

if num1 < num2:
    print(str(num1) + " is less than " + str(num2))
elif num1 > num2:
    print(str(num1) + " is greater than " + str(num2))
else:
    print(str(num1) + " is equal to " + str(num2))
``` 
This Python program does the same thing as your Java code. It takes two integer inputs from the user, and then checks each of the three comparison conditions (less than, greater than, equal to) using `if`-`elif`-`else` statements. The outputs are printed to the console.
