Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your C program:

```JavaScript
let str = "Good Morning";
const cStr1 = " to all";
const cStr2 = " !!!";
str += cStr1 + cStr2; // most idiomatic way in JS to append strings.
console.log(str);  // Display contents of the variable after append operation.
```

Please note that JavaScript doesn't have an exact equivalent for C's `sizeof` or `strlen`, so the logic related to checking available space isn't needed here in JavaScript.
