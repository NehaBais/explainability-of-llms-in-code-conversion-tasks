The Java code for the given C++ program would look like this:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
        File currentDir = new File("."); //get the current working directory
        
        // rename in current dir
        Files.move(Paths.get("input.txt"), Paths.get("output.txt"));
        Files.move(Paths<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>("docs"), Paths.get("mydocs"));
        
        // reset to the root directory ("/") before renaming 
        File rootDir = new File("/");
        currentDir.setCurrentDir(rootDir.getAbsolutePath());
        
        // rename in root dir
        Files.move(Paths.get("/input.txt"), Paths.get("/output.txt"));
        Files.move(Paths.get("/docs"), Paths.get("/mydocs"));
    }
}
```
This Java program uses the `Files.move()` method from java's NIO API to rename files and directories. Note that you cannot move a directory in its current state, i.e., while renaming "docs" into "mydocs", there should not be any file within it. If such an operation is required, then additional logic will have to be included for handling the moving of those nested files/directories.
The `File(".")` gets us the working directory and `currentDir.setCurrentDir("/")` changes our current working directory to root. The absolute paths are used in both cases to specify locations from the file system's root.  

Also, Java does not have an equivalent of C++'s std::rename function for handling renaming inside the filesystem root directly. As such, the above code tries changing directory to "/" before doing any operation related to that directory. Note that this will fail if we are in a different drive or partition and running on Windows.
