The provided Golang code is not directly convertible to Python due to reasons such as:
- The `Rename` function in Golang takes two arguments which are file names whereas in Python's `os.rename()`, it takes three arguments (file1, file2, new_name). Also, the paths used for renaming "/input.txt" and "/docs" don't exist or they may not be accessible by your user due to permission reasons.
- You can only rename files if they exist, which means these files "input.txt" and "docs" won't exist in the current working directory as per the provided code.

However, it is possible in Python, you can achieve the desired result with a script that does the following:
```python
import os

def rename_file(oldname, newname):
    if os.path.exists(oldname):  # Check if file exists
        os.rename(oldname,newname) # Rename file
        print('File renamed successfully')
    else: 
        print('File does not exist')

def rename_directory(oldname, newname):
    if os.path.exists(oldname):  # Check if directory exists
        os.rename(oldname,newname) # Rename directory
        print('Directory renamed successfully')
    else: 
        print('Directory does not exist')

# Test the function with current working directory
rename_file('input.txt', 'output.txt')
rename_directory('docs', 'mydocs')

# Test with filesystem root directory
rename_file('/input.txt', '/output.txt')
rename_directory('/docs', '/mydocs')
```
Please note that this script would work only if the user has the required permissions to rename files and directories.
