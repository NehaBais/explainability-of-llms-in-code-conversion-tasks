Here is the equivalent Python code for your C++ program. We will be using the built-in replace function provided by Python's strings to solve this problem:

```python
original = "Mary had a X lamb." 
toBeReplaced=  "X"  
replacement =   "little" 
newString = original.replace(toBeReplaced, replacement) 
print(f"String after replacement: {newString}" )
```
