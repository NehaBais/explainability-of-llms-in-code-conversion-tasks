In Golang, you can use the `+` operator for string concatenation. Here is how you can achieve this:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    hello := "Hello world"
    hello += "!!!!"
    fmt.Println(hello)
}
```

This code initializes a string variable `hello` with the value "Hello world", then appends the string literal "!!!!" to it using the `+=` operator. Finally, it prints the concatenated string.

In Go, strings are immutable, so in order to append a string, we need to reassign the result back to the original variable. Therefore, there is no need for the `push_str()` method from Rust that mutates the existing string directly.
