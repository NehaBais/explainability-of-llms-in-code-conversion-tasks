In Python you can use the `os` module to get file metadata. Here is how you could convert your rust code:

```python
import os
import sys

def main():
  try:
    # Verify size of a file called input.txt in the current working directory
    file_name = 'input.txt'
    size = os.path.getsize(file_name)
    print('Size of {} is {} bytes'.format(file_name, size)) 
  except Exception as e:
    sys.stderr.write('Error: {}'.format(str(e)))
    sys.exit(2)
  
main()
```
To verify the file in the root directory of your system you would replace 'input.txt' with '/path/to/your/file', for example `'/root/input.txt'` or `os.sep + 'input.txt'` where `os.sep` returns the separator used in your OS (`\` on Windows and `/` on Unix). 

Please note that you need to replace '/root/input.txt' with an actual path to a file, as the code above will fail if there is no such file at specified location.
