Sure! Here's the equivalent Rust code:
```
use std::fs;
fn create(path: &str) {
 let file_path = format!("{}/output.txt", path);
 fs::File::create(file_path).unwrap();
 let dir_path = format!("{}/docs", path);
 fs::create_dir(dir_path).unwrap();
}
fn main() {
 create("."); // current directory
 create("/"); // root directory
}
```
This code creates two files and directories in the current working directory and the root directory, respectively. The `fs` module is used to perform file system operations in Rust. The `create` function takes a path as an argument and uses it to construct the full paths for both the output file and the docs directory. The `File::create` method creates an empty file at the specified location, and the `create_dir` method creates a new directory if one doesn't already exist at the specified location.
