The Java version of the code will use java.nio.file.* package for checking if a file or directory exists. The equivalent of Rust's std::fs::metadata is Files.exists(). Here is how it can be done in Java:

```java
import java.nio.file.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        for (String path : new String[]{"input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", "/docs"}) {
            Path p = Paths.get(path);
            if (Files.exists(p)) {
                if (Files.isDirectory(p)) {
                    System.out.println(path + " is a directory");
                } else {
                    System.out.println(path + " is a file");
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println(path + " does not exist");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This Java code checks if the provided paths in the array exists or not, and then determines whether it's a directory or a file by checking its type. If no such path is found, an error message will be printed. 

Please note that to run this java program you need to provide absolute path for /input.txt and /docs as they are outside the current working directory where your java class resides and these paths don't exist in root of file system which Rust code is not capable of checking. 

Also, Java does not have universal way to specify a filesystem root because it's dependent on underlying operating system and how user account was created or JVM was launched (which might imply different roots). In Unix-like systems, "/" would be the file system root for example, but in Windows you can use "C:\\" as an equivalent.
