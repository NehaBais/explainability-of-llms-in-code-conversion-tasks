```java
import java.io.File;
import java.lang.Exception;

public class FileSize {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String path = "input.txt";

        try {
            File file1 = new File(path);
            long size = file1.length();
            System.out.println("Size of the first file: " + size);

            File file2 = new File("/");
            size = file2.length();
            System.out.println("Size of the second file: " + size);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
Note that in Python, when you use `os.path.getsize('input.txt')`, it calculates and returns the size in bytes. In Java, `File.length()` gives the size in bytes as well, so there is no need for additional conversion or casting of types to be made. Also note that while a file object can represent files on disk, it doesn't have any actual physical existence until you attempt to write to it (for instance, using `OutputStream` object). This may be considered an advantage in certain scenarios where you want to create a placeholder for a file that doesn't exist yet or check the size of a file that hasn't been created yet.
