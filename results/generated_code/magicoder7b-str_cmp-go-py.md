 The Python version of this code would look like this:

```python
def main():
    # Python string comparison operators:
    c = "cat"
    d = "dog"
    if c == d:
        print(c, "is identical to", d)
    else:
        print(c, "is different from", d)
        
    if c > d:
        print(c, "is lexically greater than", d)
    elif c < d:
        print(c, "is lexically less than", d)
    else:
        print(c, "is equal to", d)

    eqf = 'when interpreted as UTF-8 and compared under Unicode simple case folding rules.'
    if c.lower() == d.lower():
        print(c, "equal to", d, eqf)
    else:
        print(c, "not equal to", d, eqf)
```

This Python code performs the same comparisons as the GoLang version but it does so with Python's native string functions. Python uses Unicode, not bytes, and is case sensitive by default.
