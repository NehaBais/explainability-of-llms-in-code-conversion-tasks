 Here's the equivalent Java code for the provided C code, which performs bitwise operations on two integers `a` and `b`, including left shift, right shift (arithmetic and logical), and rotations. Note that Java does not have a specific rotation operator but you can implement them using bitwise shifts.

```java
public class BitwiseOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10; // Example values for a and b
        int b = 5;
        bitwise(a, b);
    }

    public static void bitwise(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("a and b: " + (a & b));
        System.out.println("a or b: " + (a | b));
        System.out.println("a xor b: " + (a ^ b));
        System.out.println("not a: " + (~a));
        System.out.println("a << b: " + (a << b)); // Left shift
        System.out.println("a >> b: " + (a >> b)); // Arithmetic right shift on most platforms
        // Logical right shift for Java, as there's no specific rotation operator
        int c = a;
        System.out.println("c >> b: " + ((int)c >>> b)); // Logical right shift
    }
}
```

In this Java code:
- The `~` operator is used for bitwise NOT, which works the same way as in C but note that it's applied to an integer value.
- The left shift (`<<`) and arithmetic right shift (`>>`) are directly supported by Java.
- For logical right shift (`>>>`), you need to cast the integer to `unsigned int` (which is actually done using a 32-bit unsigned conversion in Java, as there's no specific type for this unlike C). This means that even if the value of `a` is negative, it will be treated as an unsigned number during the shift operation.
