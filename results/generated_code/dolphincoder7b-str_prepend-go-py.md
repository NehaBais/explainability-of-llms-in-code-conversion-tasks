The equivalent of this Golang code in Python is:
```python
s = "world!"
s = "Hello, " + s
print(s)
```
In Golang, the `:=` operator is used to declare and initialize a variable. However, in Python, we don't have this special syntax for declaration and initialization. Instead, we use the assignment operator `=` which performs both actions (declaration and initialization).
Here's how you could run it:

s = "world!"
s = "Hello, " + s
