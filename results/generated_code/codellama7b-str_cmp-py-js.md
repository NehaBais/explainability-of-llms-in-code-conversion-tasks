The code is written in Python and it demonstrates various string comparison operations including:
- Comparing two strings for exact equality
- Comparing two strings for inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality)
- Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other
- Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after than the other
- How to achieve both case sensitive comparisons and case insensitive comparisons within the language
- How the language handles comparison of numeric strings if these are not treated lexically
The code also demonstrates other kinds of string comparisons that the language provides, particularly as it relates to its type system. 
Below is the converted code in JavaScript:
```
function compare(a, b) {
    console.log(" %r is of type %r and %r is of type %r", a, typeof a, b, typeof b);
    if (a < b)      console.log('%r is strictly less than  %r', a, b);
    if (a <= b)     console.log('%r is less than or equal to %r', a, b);
    if (a > b)      console.log('%r is strictly greater than  %r', a, b);
    if (a >= b)     console.log('%r is greater than or equal to %r', a, b);
    if (a == b)     console.log('%r is equal to %r', a, b);
    if (a != b)     console.log('%r is not equal to %r', a, b);
    if (a === b)    console.log('%r has object identity with %r', a, b);
    if (a !== b)    console.log('%r has negated object identity with %r', a, b);
}
compare('YUP', 'YUP');
compare('BALL', 'BELL');
compare('24', '123');
compare(24, 123);
compare(5.0, 5);
```
This code is similar to the original Python code in that it provides a function named "compare" which takes two arguments and performs various string comparison operations on them. The output of the code also includes logging the type of each argument as well as comparing them using different types of comparisons such as exact equality, inequality, lexical ordering, etc.
The main difference between the original Python code and the converted JavaScript code is that in JavaScript, all strings are considered to be Unicode strings whereas in Python, they are not. Also, in JavaScript, the "typeof" operator is used to determine the type of a variable, while in Python, it's the "type()" function that is used for this purpose.
