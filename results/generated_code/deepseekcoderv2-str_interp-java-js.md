The code that is provided to you is:

function format() {
  var noun;
  var verb;

  switch (noun) {
    case 'dog':
      return "I'm going to buy the dog some rain boots";
    default:
      return String.format("Mary had a %s lamb", adjective);
}

return String.format("Mary had a %s %s", noun, verb);

#### Solution 1
The solution is pretty straight forward with JavaScript string interpolation using the `template literals` feature available in ES6 and above.

For example:
```javascript
var adjective = "little";
// Interpolation of variable value to a template literal string
var lyric = `Mary had a ${adjective} lamb`;
console.log(lyric); // prints 'Mary had a little lamb' to the console (for example)
```
Also, for some variables where no values are assigned by the developer and default values defined in the switch statement should be used, then use of ternary conditional operator (`? :`) can come handy as shown below: 

function format(noun = 'lamb', verb = 'laughed') { // default value to noun is 'lamb' and for verb it is 'laughed'
  return `Mary had a ${noun} which ${verb === "laugh" ? "laughed" : "did not laugh"}`;
}
var result = format();
console.log(result);

#### Solution 2
Here, we can use the ES6 template literals feature (backticks) and string interpolation to replace multiple variable values in a single line of code for Java version. In case you are working with an older JavaScript version that does not support template literals or backtick syntax then this approach is highly recommended:  

function format(noun = 'lamb', verb = 'laughed') { // default value to noun is 'lamb' and for verb it is 'laughed'
  var newFormatString = `Mary had a ${noun} which ${verb === "laugh" ? "laughed" : "did not laugh"}`;
  return newFormatString;
}
var result = format();
console.log(result); // Mary had a lamb which laughed
