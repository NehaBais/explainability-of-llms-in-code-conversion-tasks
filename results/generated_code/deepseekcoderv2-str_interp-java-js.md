 Certainly! Below is the JavaScript code that performs string interpolation similar to the Java code you provided:

```javascript
let adjective = "little";
let lyric = `Mary had a ${adjective} lamb`;
console.log(lyric); // Output: Mary had a little lamb
```

In this JavaScript code, we use template literals (backticks) for string interpolation, where `${variableName}` is used to embed the value of the variable `adjective` into the string.
