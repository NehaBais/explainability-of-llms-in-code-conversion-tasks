The provided C++ code can be converted to Python with minor changes. Below is the equivalent Python code:
```python
def main():
    # get two integers from user
    a = int(input("Enter first integer: "))
    b = int(input("Enter second integer: "))

    # test for less-than
    if a < b:
        print(f"{a} is less than {b}")

    # test for equality
    if a == b:
        print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")

    # test for greater-than
    if a > b:
        print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```
In this code, we define the `main` function. Inside the function, we prompt the user to enter two integers using `input()`. The `int()` function is used to convert the input to integer format. 

After getting both integers, we compare them with each other using three comparison operators `<`, `==`, and `>`:
- If `a` is less than `b`, we print a message indicating that "a is less than b".
- If `a` equals `b`, we print a message indicating that "a is equal to b".
- If `a` is greater than `b`, we print a message indicating that "a is greater than b".

Note: The `>>` operator in C++ can be represented as Python's `.read()` method. However, this code snippet doesn't include any input or output operations due to the lack of required I/O functions and libraries. Therefore, it cannot be executed properly.
