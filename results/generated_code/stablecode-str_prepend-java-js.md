Here's how you can convert this Java code into JavaScript:

```javascript
let str = "def";
str = "abc" + str;
```
In the above JavaScript code, `let` is used to declare a variable (similar to using `String` in Java). 

The concatenation operation (`+`) combines the string literal "abc" with the current value of the `str` variable. The result is stored back into the `str` variable.
