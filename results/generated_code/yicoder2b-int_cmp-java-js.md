The equivalent JavaScript code for the given Java code would be:

```javascript
let num1 = parseInt(prompt('Enter first integer'));
let num2 = parseInt(prompt('Enter second integer'));

if (num1 < num2) {
    console.log(num1 + " is less than " + num2);
} 
else if (num1 > num2) {
    console.log(num1 + " is greater than " + num2);
}
else {
    console.log(num1 + " is equal to " + num2);
}
```
This JavaScript code does the same thing as the provided Java code. It takes two integers from user input, then uses if/else statements to compare them and output a message depending on which integer is greater or less than the other.
