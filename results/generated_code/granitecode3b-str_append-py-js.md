Here's the equivalent JavaScript code:
```
var str = "12345678";
str += "9!";
console.log(str);
```
This code creates a string variable called `str` and assigns it the value of "12345678". It then appends the string literal "9!" to the end of the variable using the `+=` operator, which is shorthand for `str = str + "9!"` in Python. Finally, it logs the contents of the variable to the console using the `console.log()` function.
