To convert the C code to Golang, we need to identify the required system calls and their equivalents in the Go language. Here are the translations:

1. `#include <sys/stat.h>` is not necessary in Go as it contains definitions for standard I/O functions such as `open` or `close`.
2. `#include <unistd.h>` contains definitions related to file operations, such as `mkdir`, `write`, etc.
3. `#include <fcntl.h>` is not needed in the context of C, as it provides constants for the flags used by system calls like `open` and `creat`.
4. The equivalent of `open` in Go would be the `os.OpenFile` function: `fd := os.OpenFile("output.txt", os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE|os.O_TRUNC, 0640)` to create a new file and truncate its contents to zero bytes.
5. The equivalent of `creat` in Go would be the `os.Create` function: `fd := os.Create("output.txt")` creates a new file with permissions set by default from the umask.
6. To close a file, we can use the `Close` method on the file handle: `err = fd.Close()`.
7. The equivalent of `mkdir` in Go would be the `os.Mkdir` function: `os.Mkdir("docs", 0750)` to create an empty directory with the specified permissions.
8. To set the current working directory in Go, we can use the `ChDir` method on the `os` package: `err = os.ChDir("/home/user")`.
9. The equivalent of the `close(fd);` statement in C is an implicit close when the file handle is automatically garbage collected by the runtime.
10. The equivalent of a function returning zero is to use the `os.Exit(0)` function or similarly in Go: `os.Exit(0)`.

Here's the converted Golang code for creating an empty file and directory:
```go
package main
import (
    "os"
)
func main() {
    err := os.ChDir("/home/user") // Change the current working directory to "/home/user"
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fd, err := os.OpenFile("output.txt", os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE|os.O_TRUNC, 0640) // Create a new file with permissions rw-r----- and truncate its contents to zero bytes
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer fd.Close()

    err = os.Mkdir("docs", 0750) // Create an empty directory with permissions rwxr-x---
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```
This code creates a new file called "output.txt" in the current working directory, and it also creates an empty directory called "docs". You can adjust the permissions to fit your needs or use different system calls like `chmod` instead of specifying them as flags in `os.OpenFile`.
