Here is the Python equivalent of your C code:

```python
s1 = "hello"
s2 = s1 + " literal"
print(s1)
print(s2)
```

In this Python version, we have created two string variables 's1' and 's2'. The value of 's1' is the original text. Then 's2' is set to be a concatenation of 's1' and another string literal. Finally, both strings are printed out to show their contents.
