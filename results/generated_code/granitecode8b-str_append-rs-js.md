Here's the JavaScript code that meets the requirements:
```
let hello = "Hello world";
hello += "!!!!";
console.log(hello);
```
This code creates a string variable `hello` with the value `"Hello world"`. It then appends another string literal `"!!!!"` to the end of the variable using the `+=` operator, which is a more idiomatic way to append strings in JavaScript compared to `push_str()`. Finally, it logs the contents of the variable to the console.
