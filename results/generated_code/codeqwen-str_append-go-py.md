Here is the Python equivalent of your Golang code:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
text = "foo"

# Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way
text += "bar"

# Show the contents of the variable after the append operation
print(text)
```

This code will print out: `foobar`.
