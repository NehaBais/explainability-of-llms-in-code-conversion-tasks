The equivalent code in JavaScript would be:

```javascript
let str = "my String";
str = 'Changed '.concat(str);
console.log(str);
```
This script does the same thing as your C program - it first declares a string `str` and assigns it any text value (in this case, "my String"). It then pre-pends another string literal to that variable. Finally, it logs out the concatenated string in the console.
