The provided Rust code is to rename files and directories in the file system on a Unix-like operating system. Unfortunately, it's crucial to mention that this code works under the assumption that the user has appropriate permissions to perform such operations.

To convert this Rust code into Python, you need to import `shutil` module for Unix/Linux systems or `os` module in Windows for performing file operations. 

Here is how to achieve the same in Python:

```python
import os
import shutil  # Unix-like systems

def rename_files():
    err = "File move error"
    try:
        if not os.path.exists('input.txt'):
            raise FileNotFoundError(err)
        os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt')

        if not os.path.exists('docs'):
            raise FileNotFoundError(err)
        os.rename('docs', 'mydocs')
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(e)
        return False
    else:
        return True

def rename_directory():
    if not os.path.exists('/input.txt'):
        raise FileNotFoundError
    os.rename('/input.txt', '/output.txt')

    if not os.path.exists('/docs'):
        raise FileNotFoundError
    os.rename('/docs', '/mydocs')

# Execute the function
try:
    print("File renaming in current directory:", rename_files())
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
finally:
    print("\nRenaming files and directories at root:", rename_directory())
```
Please note that this Python version will also throw an error if the original or target file/folder does not exist. You might want to amend this as required by your application's error handling requirements. Also, make sure `shutil` is only imported if needed in production code.
