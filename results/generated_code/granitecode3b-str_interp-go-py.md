Here's the Python code that performs string interpolation using the `format()` function:
```
package main

import (
 print = print)

func main() {
 str = "Mary had a {} lamb"
 txt = "little"
 out = str.format(txt)
 print(out)
}
```
Note that in Python, `str` is a built-in type for strings, so there's no need to declare it as a string. Also, the `print()` function is used instead of `fmt.Println()`.
