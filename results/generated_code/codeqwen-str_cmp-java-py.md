Here's the equivalent Python code for your Java code:
```python
def compare(A, B):
    if A == B:
        print("'{}' and '{}' are lexically equal.".format(A, B))
    else:
        print("'{}' and '{}' are not lexically equal.".format(A, B))

    if A.lower() == B.lower():
        print("'{}' and '{}' are case-insensitive lexically equal.".format(A, B))
    else:
        print("'{}' and '{}' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.".format(A, B))

    if A < B:
        print("'{}' is lexically before '{}'. ".format(A, B))
    elif A > B:
        print("'{}' is lexically after '{}'. ".format(A, B))
    else:
        print("The lexical relationship is not well defined. ")

    if A <= B:
        print("'{}' is not lexically before '{}'. ".format(A, B))
    elif A >= B:
        print("'{}' is not lexically after '{}'. ".format(A, B))
    else:
        print("The relationship is not well defined. ")

    print("The lexical relationship is: {}".format(A < B))
    print("The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: {}\n".format((A.lower()) < (B.lower())))

compare("Hello", "Hello")
compare("5", "5.0")
compare("java", "Java")
compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ")
compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĵãvá")
```
This Python code uses the same methods as the Java version to compare two strings and handle various comparisons: exact equality, case-insensitive comparison, lexical ordering, and so on. Note that in Python, string comparison is lexical by default, but you can use `.lower()` or other functions to perform case-insensitive comparisons.
