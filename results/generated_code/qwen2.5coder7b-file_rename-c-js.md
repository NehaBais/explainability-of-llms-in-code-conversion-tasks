To convert the given C code to JavaScript, you can use the `fs` module provided by Node.js. The `fs.rename()` method is used to rename a file or directory.

Here's how you can achieve the same functionality in JavaScript:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Rename files and directories in the current working directory
fs.renameSync('input.txt', 'output.txt');
fs.renameSync('docs', 'mydocs');

// Rename files and directories in the filesystem root (requires elevated privileges)
try {
  fs.renameSync('/input.txt', '/output.txt');
  fs.renameSync('/docs', '/mydocs');
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Error renaming files or directories in the filesystem root:', err);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Require the `fs` module**: The `fs` module provides an API for interacting with the file system.
2. **Rename in the current working directory**: Use `fs.renameSync()` to rename `input.txt` to `output.txt` and `docs` to `mydocs`.
3. **Rename in the filesystem root**: Similar to the C code, try to rename `/input.txt` to `/output.txt` and `/docs` to `/mydocs`. Note that renaming files or directories in the filesystem root may require elevated privileges, so you should handle any potential errors gracefully.

### Note:
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to rename files and directories.
- Running code with elevated privileges (like renaming files in the filesystem root) might require running your script as an administrator or using a tool that supports such operations.
