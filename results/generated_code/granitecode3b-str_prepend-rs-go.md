Here's the equivalent Golang code:
```
var s = "World"
s = "Hello " + s
fmt.Println(s)
```
Explanation:
- The first line declares a string variable `s` and assigns it the value `"World"`.
- The second line prepares to insert the string literal `"Hello "` into the original string, but we need to use the `+` operator for strings in Golang.
- The third line concatenates the two strings using the `+` operator and stores the result back into the `s` variable.
- The fourth line prints the value of `s`, which should now be `"Hello World"`.
Note that the `fmt.Println()` function is used to print the string variable `s` to the console, as it is not a built-in function in Golang.
