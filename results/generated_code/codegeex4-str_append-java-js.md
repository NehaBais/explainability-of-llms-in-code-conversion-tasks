Here is your Java code converted to JavaScript:

```javascript
var string = "abc";
console.log(string);
string += "def";
console.log(string);
```

Just like in the Java version, this JavaScript code creates a string variable `string` with the value of `"abc"`, then logs that value to the console. It then appends the string literal `"def"` to `string`, and finally logs the new value of `string` to the console.
