Here is the Java code that fulfills the given requirement:
```
public class Logic {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 boolean a = true;
 boolean b = false;
 System.out.println("a and b: " + (a && b));
 System.out.println("a or b: " + (a || b));
 System.out.println("not a: " + !a);
 }
}
```
This code declares two boolean variables `a` and `b`, initializes them with the given values, and then uses logical operators to compute the desired results. The `&&` operator represents the "and" operation, the `||` operator represents the "or" operation, and the `!` operator represents the "not" operation.
