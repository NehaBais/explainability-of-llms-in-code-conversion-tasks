Here's how you can convert your JavaScript code into Python:

```python
s = "hello"
print(s + " there!")
```

In this code:
- The variable `s` is created and initialized with the string value `"hello"`.
- Then, `s` is concatenated with another string literal `" there!"`, and the result is printed to the console.
