Here is the Rust code that demonstrates how to compare two strings and achieve a lexical comparison:
```
fn main() {
 let s1 = String::from("abcd");
 let s2 = String::from("dcba");
 
 println!("{} == {}: {}", s1, s2, s1 == s2); // true
 println!("{} === {}: {}", s1, s2, s1 == s2); // false
 println!("{} != {}: {}", s1, s2, s1 != s2); // false
 println!("{} !== {}: {}", s1, s2, s1 != s2); // true
 println!("{} < {}: {}", s1, s2, s1 < s2); // true
 println!("{} > {}: {}", s1, s2, s1 > s2); // false
 let s3 = s1.to_lowercase();
 let s4 = s2.to_lowercase();
 println!("{} == {}: {}", s3, s4, s3 == s4); // true
}
```
In this code, we create two `String` variables `s1` and `s2` with the values "abcd" and "dcba", respectively. We then use various comparison operators to compare these strings for equality, inequality, and lexical order.
- The `==` operator compares the values of the two strings, so `"abcd"` is equal to itself but not equal to `"dcba"`.
- The `===` operator compares both the value and type of the two strings, so `"abcd"` is not equal to `"dcba"` even though they have the same value.
- The `!=` operator compares the values of the two strings for inequality, so `"abcd"` is not equal to `"dcba"`.
- The `!==` operator compares both the value and type of the two strings for inequality, so `"abcd"` is not equal to `"dcba"`.
- The `<` operator compares the lexical order of the two strings, so `"abcd"` is lexically ordered before `"dcba"`.
- The `>` operator compares the lexical order of the two strings, so `"abcd"` is not lexically ordered after `"dcba"`.
- We use the `to_lowercase()` method to convert both strings to lowercase and then compare them for equality. This demonstrates how to achieve a case insensitive comparison in Rust.
