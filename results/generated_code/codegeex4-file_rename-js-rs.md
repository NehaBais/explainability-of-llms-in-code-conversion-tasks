To achieve similar functionality in Rust, you can use the `std::fs` and `std::path` modules. However, please note that unlike JavaScript, Rust doesn't have built-in support for recursive directory operations like renaming or moving directories with their contents. Therefore, a custom solution is provided.

The following example renames files and directories within the current working directory and also attempts to do so at the root of the filesystem. The `std::os` module is used to handle platform-specific paths if necessary:

```rust
use std::fs::{self, rename};
use std::io;
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

fn move_file(src: &str, dest: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
    fs::rename(src, dest)
}

fn move_dir(src: &str, dest: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
    // Move each file inside the directory
    for entry in fs::read_dir(src)? {
        let entry = entry?;
        if entry.file_type()?.is_file() {
            let src_path = entry.path();
            let new_name = format!("{}/{}", dest, src_path.file_name().unwrap());
            move_file(&src_path.to_string_lossy(), &new_name)?;
        }
    }
    // Finally rename the directory itself
    fs::rename(src, dest)
}

fn main() {
    if let Err(e) = move_here("input.txt", "output.txt") {
        eprintln!("Error in current directory: {}", e);
    }

    if let Err(e) = move_here("docs", "mydocs") {
        eprintln!("Error in current directory for docs: {}", e);
    }
    
    if let Err(e) = move_root("input.txt", "output.txt") {
        eprintln!("Error at root directory: {}", e);
    }

    if let Err(e) = move_root("docs", "mydocs") {
        eprintln!("Error at root directory for docs: {}", e);
    }
}

fn move_here(src: &str, dest: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
    move_file(src, dest)?;
    move_dir(src, dest)
}

// Attempt to operate in the root directory
fn move_root(src: &str, dest: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
    if cfg!(target_os = "windows") {
        // Get current drive letter on Windows
        let drive_letter = std::env::var("SystemDrive").expect("Unable to get system drive");
        move_file(&(drive_letter + "/" + src), &(drive_letter + "/" + dest))?;
        move_dir(&(drive_letter + "/" + src), &(drive_letter + "/" + dest))
    } else {
        // Assuming Linux or other POSIX-like OS
        move_file(src, dest)?;
        move_dir(src, dest)
    }
}
```

This code defines two functions to handle the moving of files and directories. The `move_here` function is used for operations within the current working directory, while `move_root` is intended to operate in the root directory but needs more specific handling depending on the OS.

Please be aware that this example assumes you have write permissions at both the current directory and the root level. Additionally, it does not handle symbolic links or other file system peculiarities you may encounter with real-world usage. This should be considered a basic outline to get started with the conversion of your original JavaScript code into Rust.
