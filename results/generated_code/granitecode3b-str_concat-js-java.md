Here's the equivalent Java code for the given JavaScript code:
```
String s = "hello";
String t = s + " there!";
System.out.println(t);
```
In this Java code, we first declare a string variable `s` and assign it the value "hello" using the `=` operator. Then, we concatenate the value of `s` with the string literal " there!" using the `+` operator and store the result in another string variable `t`. Finally, we print the content of both variables using the `System.out.println()` method.
