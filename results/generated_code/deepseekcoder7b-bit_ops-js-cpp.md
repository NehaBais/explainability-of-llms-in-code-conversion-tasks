Below is the equivalent C++ code for your JavaScript function. I'm assuming that `b` will be unsigned integer as in C/C++, bitwise shift operations are undefined if the shift count is negative or greater than the width of the integral type (like more than 32 bits for int). Note also that "~a" doesn't do what you expect from a logical NOT because it performs an arithmetic negation on `a` which is not the same as bitwise NOT.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include<bitset>
using namespace std;

void bitwise(int a, unsigned int b){
   cout << "a AND b: " << (a & b) << "\n";
   cout << "a OR b: "<< (a | b) << "\n";
   cout << "a XOR b: "<< (a ^ b) << "\n";
   
   // uncomment below line to see negative result for signed integer
   //cout << "NOT a: " << ~a << "\n"; 

   if(b<32){
       cout << "a left shift by b: "<< (a << b) << "\n"; // left shift
       cout << "a right shift by b: "<< (a >> b) << "\n"; // arithmetic right shift
       
       // logical right shift for unsigned integer in C++ is different from JavaScript. In JS, it's an arithmetic shift that fills with sign bit(1 or 0). But we cannot directly use '>>>='. So, instead of doing "a >>> b", let's first do right shift then left shift to mimic the behavior of logical right shift in JS
       int ar = (a >> b); // for JavaScript: a >>> b
       cout << "a right shift by b with fill 0: "<< (ar << 32) >> (32 - b % 32)  << "\n";  
    }else{
      cout<<"Shift/rotate amount is out of range. It should be less than bit width\n";
    }    
}
```

Note: C++ doesn't have an exact equivalent to JavaScript's `~` operator for a logical NOT, but the result of arithmetic shift right operation(`>>`) can simulate it via left and right shift. The commented line is not working as expected for signed integer in C++ because bitwise complement(NOT) of negative number does not make sense logically.
