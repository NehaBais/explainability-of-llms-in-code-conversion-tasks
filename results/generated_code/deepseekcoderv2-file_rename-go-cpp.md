 Here's the equivalent code in C++ that performs the same operations as your Go code:

```cpp
#include <filesystem> // For std::filesystem::rename
#include <iostream>   // For std::cout, std::cerr

int main() {
    try {
        // Rename file "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the current working directory
        std::filesystem::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
        
        // Rename directory "docs" to "mydocs" in the current working directory
        std::filesystem::rename("docs", "mydocs");
        
        // Rename file "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the filesystem root
        std::filesystem::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
        
        // Rename directory "docs" to "mydocs" in the filesystem root
        std::filesystem::rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
    } catch (const std::filesystem::filesystem_error& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << '\n';
        return 1;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code uses the `std::filesystem::rename` function to rename files and directories, handling exceptions for any potential errors that might occur during the renaming process. Note that in C++, paths are specified as strings, similar to Go's file paths.
