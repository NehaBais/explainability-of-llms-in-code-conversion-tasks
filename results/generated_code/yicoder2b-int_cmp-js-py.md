The JavaScript function you provided is for comparing two integers, whereas in Python programming language, we use comparison operators like less than (<), equals to (==), greater than (>). Here's how the equivalent code in Python would look:

```python
# Using comparison operator in python
def compare(a, b):
    if a < b: 
        print(f'{a} is less than {b}')
    elif a > b: 
        print(f'{a} is greater than {b}')
    else: 
        print(f'{a} equals {b}')
```
This Python function does the same as your JavaScript function - it takes two integers and prints out whether the first integer is less than, equal to, or greater than the second integer. If the types are not identical (i.e., one of the inputs is a number and the other is a string), then an error message will be printed indicating the type mismatch.
