Below is the Java equivalent of your provided C code. In addition to handling bitwise operations, this version also utilizes Java's specific `Integer` class methods for arithmetic right shift and logical left/right rotation. Note that in Java, bitwise NOT on a signed integer (a) results in a strange behavior because it sign-extends the bits of negative numbers, whereas in C this is undefined behavior.

```java
import java.util.*;
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Enter two integers: ");
    int a = scan.nextInt();
    int b = scan.nextInt();
    
    System.out.printf("a and b: %d\n", a & b);
    System.out.printf("a or b: %d\n", a | b);
    System.out.printf("a xor b: %d\n", a ^ b);
    
   /* There is no bitwise NOT on signed integers in Java; we use >>> (logical shift) instead */
    System.out.printf("~a: %d\n", a >>> 32); // Logical right shift of an integer

    System.out.printf("a << b: %d\n", a << b); // left shift
    System.out.printf("a >> b: %d\n", a >> b); // arithmetic right shift (logical, not always what you expect for negative numbers)
    
    /* In Java, it is safe to use >>> on an integer; the >>> operator performs zero-fill right shift */
    System.out.printf("a >>> b: %d\n", a >>> b); // logical right shift (always positive) 
  
    /* For left rotate and right rotate, we need to manually perform these operations */
    System.out.printf("Left rotation of a by b positions : %d\n", ((a << b) | (a >> 32 - b))); // Left Rotate
    System.out.printf("Right rotation of a by b positions: %d\n", ((a >> b) | (a << 32 - b))); // Right Rotate
  }  
}
```
In the `main` method, we take two integers as input from user and apply bitwise operations on them. Note that Java uses ">>>" for zero-fill right shift or logical shift which is equivalent to C's `>>` but always results in a positive value. Also note that left rotate and right rotate are manually performed using the above formulas.
