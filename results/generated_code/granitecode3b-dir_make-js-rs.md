Sure, here's the equivalent Rust code for the given function:
```
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
use std::fs;

fn mkdirp<P: AsRef<Path>>(path: P, mode: u32) -> Result<(), fs::Error> {
    let path = path.as_ref().to_owned();

    if !path.exists() && !path.is_file() {
        fs::create_dir_all(&path)?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```
This function takes a `Path` object and a mode as input, and creates the directory and any missing parents. It uses the `fs::create_dir_all` function to create the directory and its parent directories recursively. If the directory already exists, it returns successfully without doing anything.
Note that this code assumes that the user has already checked for the existence of the directory before calling this function, and if it does not exist, it will try to create it.
