The equivalent JavaScript code for the given Golang code would be as follows:
```javascript
let str = "Mary had a %s lamb";
let txt = "little";
let out = str.replace("%s", txt);
console.log(out);
```
In this code, we're using `replace()` method to perform string interpolation. The `%s` is replaced by the value of the variable `txt`.
