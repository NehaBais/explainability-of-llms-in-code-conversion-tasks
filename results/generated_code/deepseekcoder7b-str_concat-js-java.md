In Java, you would use the `String` class to do this like so:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "hello";
        System.out.println((s + " there!"));
    }
}
```

In Java, the `+` operator concatenates two strings together. The variable `s` is initialized with a string literal of "hello". Then, after that, we print out the result of concatenating this string with another string literal (" there!"). This prints out: `hello there!`.
