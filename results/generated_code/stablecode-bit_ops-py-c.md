The provided Python code has been successfully converted to C. Here are the conversion results:

1. The helper function `helper_funcs(width, a)` has been defined in C as well. This function takes three arguments - `width`, `a`. It also includes comments explaining each line of code.

2. The main function `bitwise_built_ins(width, a, b))` has been defined in C as well. This function takes four arguments - `width`, `a`, and `b`. It performs bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR) on the integers `a` and `b`, and also performs left shift, right shift, arithmetic right shift operations on the integer `a`. It also includes comments explaining each line of code.

Please note that these C functions expect certain arguments to have specific formats (e.g., bitwise numbers), so make sure you pass the correct arguments when calling these functions.
