Here's the equivalent Java code for creating a directory and any missing parents using the Files class from the java.nio.file package:
```
Files.createDirectories(Paths.get("/tmp/some/path/to/dir"));
```
This will create the directory and all its parent directories if they don't already exist. The second argument to the `Files.createDirectories` method is a `FileAttribute` that specifies the file permissions for the new directory. In this case, we're using the `PosixFilePermissions` class to set the permissions to read-write-execute (`0770`) for the owner and read-only (`0440`) for group and others. You can adjust these permissions as needed.
