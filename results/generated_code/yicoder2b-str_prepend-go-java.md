Sure, here's how you can convert this code into Java:

```java
String s = "world!"; 
s = "Hello, ".concat(s);
```
This Java version does the same thing as your original Golang code - it assigns the string "Hello, " to a variable `s` and then concatenates this string with the string "world!", which results in the new value of `s` being "Hello, world!".
