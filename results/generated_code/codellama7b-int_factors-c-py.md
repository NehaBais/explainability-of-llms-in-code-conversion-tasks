 This code is written in C and uses a struct to store the factors of a number. The `factor` function takes an integer `num` and a pointer to a `Factors` struct, `fctrs`, as input. It then allocates memory for the list of factors and starts computing the factors.

Here's the equivalent code in Python:
```
# Factors is a class that stores the factors of a number
class Factors:
    def __init__(self):
        self.factors = []

# factor takes an integer num and a Factors object fctrs as input
def factor(num, fctrs):
    # allocate memory for the list of factors
    fctrs.factors = [None] * 301

    # start computing the factors
    dvsr = 1
    while dvsr*dvsr < num:
        if num % dvsr != 0:
            dvsr += 1
            continue
        fctrs.factors.append(dvsr)
        fctrs.factors.append(num/dvsr)
        dvsr += 1
    if dvsr*dvsr == num:
        fctors.factors.append(dvsr)

# main function to test the factor function
def main():
    # list of numbers to be factored
    nums2factor = [2059, 223092870, 3135, 45]

    # initialize a Factors object to store the factors
    ftors = Factors()

    # loop through each number in the list and factor it
    for num in nums2factor:
        factor(num, ftors)

        # print the factors of each number
        print("Factors of", num, ":")
        sep = " "
        for factor in ftors.factors:
            print(sep, factor)
            sep = ","
```
In Python, we use a class to store the factors of a number, and define a `factor` function that takes an integer `num` and a `Factors` object `fctrs` as input. The function first allocates memory for the list of factors using a list comprehension, and then starts computing the factors by checking if each number from 1 to the square root of `num` is divisible by it. If it is, we add both the divider and the quotient to the list of factors. If not, we increment the divider by 1 and repeat the process until we reach the square root of `num`. Finally, if the number is a perfect square, we add its square root to the list of factors.

The main function then loops through each number in the list and calls the `factor` function on it, printing the resulting factors for each number.
