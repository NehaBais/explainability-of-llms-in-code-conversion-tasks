To convert this code from C to Python, you can use the `os` module in Python to perform the same operations as the C code. Here is an example of how you could do this:
```
import os

def main():
    # rename "input.txt" into "output.txt" and "docs" into "mydocs" in current working directory
    os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
    os.rename("docs", "mydocs")

    # rename "/input.txt" into "/output.txt" and "/docs" into "/mydocs" in filesystem root
    os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
    os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This code uses the `os` module to perform the same operations as the C code, specifically renaming files and directories using the `os.rename()` function. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` line is used to ensure that the `main()` function is only executed when the script is run directly, rather than when it is imported by another module.
