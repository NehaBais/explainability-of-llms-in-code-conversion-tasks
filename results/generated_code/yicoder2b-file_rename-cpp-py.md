Sure, the equivalent Python code would be:

```python
import os

# Rename file input.txt to output.txt
os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt')

# Rename directory docs to mydocs
os.rename('docs', 'mydocs')

# Rename file /input.txt to /output.txt
os.rename('/input.txt', '/output.txt')

# Rename directory /docs to /mydocs
os.rename('/docs', '/mydocs')
```
Please note that in Python, the root directory is usually denoted by a leading slash (/), while in the C++ it is represented by two leading slashes (///). If you use these in your code, they should be replaced with `/` if you are using a Unix-like operating system or equivalent for Windows or another OS that does not have the concept of filesystem roots.
