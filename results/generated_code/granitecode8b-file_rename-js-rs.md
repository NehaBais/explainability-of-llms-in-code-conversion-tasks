Here's the Rust code that achieves the same requirement as the given JavaScript code:
```
use std::fs;
fn main() {
 // Rename file in current working directory
 fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").unwrap();
 // Rename file in root directory
 fs::rename("/c:/input.txt", "/c:/output.txt").unwrap();
 // Rename directory in current working directory
 fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").unwrap();
 // Rename directory in root directory
 fs::rename("/c:/docs", "/c:/mydocs").unwrap();
}
```
Note that the Rust code uses the `std::fs` module to work with files and directories, and the `unwrap()` method is used to handle any errors that may occur during the file or directory operations. Also note that the paths in the Rust code are specified as relative or absolute URLs starting from the root directory (`/`), whereas in the JavaScript code they are specified relative to the current working directory.
