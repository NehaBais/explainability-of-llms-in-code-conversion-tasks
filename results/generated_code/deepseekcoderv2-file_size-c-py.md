 Certainly! Below is the Python code that performs the same task as the given C code:

```python
import os

def main():
    try:
        # Check the size of input.txt in the current working directory
        stat_info = os.stat('input.txt')
        print(stat_info.st_size)
        
        # Check the size of /input.txt (should be equivalent to checking '/input.txt' on Unix-like systems)
        stat_info = os.stat('/input.txt')
        print(stat_info.st_size)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File not found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code uses the `os` module to get the file information, including the size, for both files named `input.txt`, first in the current working directory and then in the root of the filesystem (assuming Unix-like path syntax). If the file does not exist, it will catch a `FileNotFoundError` and print "File not found".
