The following is the equivalent JavaScript code using Node.js 'fs' package:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
try {
    // Rename file in current working directory
    fs.renameSync('input.txt', 'output.txt'); 
    console.log("File renamed successfully!");
  
    //Rename Directory in current working directory
    fs.renameSync('docs', 'mydocs');
    console.log("Directory renamed successfully!")

    // Rename file at filesystem root
    fs.renameSync('/input.txt', '/output.txt'); 
    console.log("Root File renamed successfully!");
  
    //Rename Directory in filesystem root
    fs.renameSync('/docs', '/mydocs');
    console.log("Root directory renamed successfully!")
} catch (error) {
   console.log('Error occured: ' + error.message); 
}
```
Please note that the fs operations are not atomic and if any of these operations fail they will leave your file system in an inconsistent state. 

Also, you need to make sure Node.js has sufficient permissions for renaming files/directories at those locations. If it doesn't have the necessary permissions then it would result into error.
