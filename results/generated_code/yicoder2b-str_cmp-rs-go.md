This problem is asking to convert the given Rust code into Golang. For the given code, we will demonstrate a lexical comparison of strings and handle case sensitivity and case insensitivity. 

Golang:
The above Rust code can be directly translated into Golang as it does not require additional steps for comparing the strings and handling case sensitivity/insensitivity. Here is the equivalent Golang code:

```golang
package main

import (
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	a := "abc"
	b := "Bac"

	// Strings are coerced to string when needed, Golang doesn't need to borrow a&str.
	if *a == b {
		println("The strings are equal")
	} else if *a != b {
		println("The strings are not equal")
	}
	if a > &b {
		println("The first string is lexically after the second")
	}
	if a < &b {
		println("The first string is lexically before the second")
	}
	if a >= &b {
		println("The first string is not lexically before the second")
	}
	if a <= &b {
		println("The first string is not lexically after the second")
	}

	// case-insensitives:

	// equality
	// this avoids new allocations, Golang does not need to borrow b&str.
	if strings.EqualIgnoreCase(a, &b) { println("Both strings are equal when ignoring case") }
}
```
