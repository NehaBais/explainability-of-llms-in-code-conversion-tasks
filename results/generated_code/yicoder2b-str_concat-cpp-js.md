Sure, here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your C++ code:

```javascript
let s = "hello";
console.log(s + ' literal');
let s2 = s + ' literal';
console.log(s2);
```
This program creates a string variable named `s` and assigns it the value of `'hello'`. Then it logs this string to the console, followed by the word `'literal'`. It also declares another string variable `s2`, which is equivalent to `s + ' literal'`. Finally, it logs the concatenated string to the console.
