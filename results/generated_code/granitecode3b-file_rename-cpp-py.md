Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task as the given C++ code:
```python
import os
# Rename input.txt to output.txt in the current working directory
os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
# Rename docs to mydocs in the filesystem root
os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
``` 
This code uses the `os` module in Python to perform the file and directory renaming operations. The `os.rename()` function takes two arguments: the old file or directory name and the new file or directory name. In this case, we use it twice to rename the input.txt file to output.txt and the docs directory to mydocs.
