Here is the equivalent code in Rust.

```rust
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
```
In Rust, the keywords for logical operators are `&&`, `||` and `!`. The same as in JavaScript. The output is printed with the `println!()` macro just like in the original code.
