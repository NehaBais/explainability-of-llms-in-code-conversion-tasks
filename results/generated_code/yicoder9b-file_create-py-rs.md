In Rust there is no direct equivalent to Python's open method that requires file to be closed explicitly so we are going to use File's create method instead. Note also, the root directory '/' will depend on your system and it may not be possible to access it due to permissions constraints. 

Here is how you can implement this in Rust:
```rust
use std::fs::{create_dir, File};
use std::path::Path;

fn create(directory: &str) {
    let mut path = directory.to_string();
    path.push('/');
    path.push_str("output.txt");
    File::create(&path).expect("Failed to create file"); 
   
    path = directory.to_string();
    path.push('/');
    path.push_str("docs");
    create_dir(&path).expect("Failed to create directory");
}
fn main() {
    // current directory
    create("."); 
    // root directory, this might not work depending on the system and permissions
    create("/");  
}
```
This code creates a new empty file called "output.txt" in the specified directory and an empty directory named "docs". It is running twice - once with the current working directory (denoted as '.'), and once with the root of the filesystem ('/'). If creation fails for any reason (such as permissions error), it will panic with an error message "Failed to create file" or "Failed to create directory" respectively.
