 Here's the equivalent Python code for the given C code. This code gets two integers from the user and compares them using three comparison operators to display appropriate messages based on their values.

```python
# Get input from the user
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))

# Compare and print based on the condition
if a < b:
    print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
elif a == b:
    print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")
else:  # This covers both cases where a > b
    print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```

This Python code uses an `input` function to get the integers from the user, and it employs an if-elif-else structure to compare the two integers. The output message will be printed based on whether the first integer is less than, equal to, or greater than the second integer.
