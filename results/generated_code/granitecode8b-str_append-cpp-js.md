Here's the converted code from C++ to JavaScript that meets the requirement:
```
let greeting = 'Hello';
greeting += ', world!';
console.log(greeting);
```
In this code, we first declare a variable `greeting` and assign it the string value `'Hello'`. Then, we use the `+=` operator to append the string literal `', world!'` to the end of the `greeting` variable. Finally, we log the contents of the `greeting` variable to the console using `console.log()`.
