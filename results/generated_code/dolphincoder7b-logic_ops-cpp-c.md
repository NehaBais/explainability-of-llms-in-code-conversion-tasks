The equivalent C code for the given C++ function would look something like this:
```c
void print_logic(bool a, bool b) {
    // Printing boolean values as "true" and "false".
    printf("%s\n", true ? "true" : "false");
    // Outputting the result of "and" and "or" on both arguments.
    printf("a and b is %s\n", (a && b) ? "true" : "false");
    printf("a or b is %s\n", (a || b) ? "true" : "false");
    // Outputting the result of "not" on the first argument.
    printf("not a is %s\n", (!a) ? "true" : "false");
}
```
This C code follows the same logic as the original C++ function, only using `printf()` instead of `std::cout` for printing and implementing the logical operations using standard Boolean operators (`&&`, `||`, and `!`). Note that C does not have a direct equivalent to `std::boolalpha`. However, this can be achieved by writing a function that converts boolean values to strings before printing them.
