In Rust, the `std::fs::rename` function can be used to rename files and directories. The following is the equivalent code in Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").expect("Failed to rename input.txt");
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").expect("Failed to rename docs");
    fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt").expect("Failed to rename /input.txt");
    fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs").expect("Failed to rename /docs");
}
```

This code will attempt to rename files and directories in the current directory as well as at the root level of the filesystem. If the renaming operation is not successful for any reason (for example, because there are permissions issues), an error message will be displayed.
