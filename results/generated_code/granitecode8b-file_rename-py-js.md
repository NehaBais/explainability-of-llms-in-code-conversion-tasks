Here's the JavaScript code that achieves the same requirements as the Python code:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
// Rename file in current working directory
fs.renameSync('input.txt', 'output.txt');
fs.renameSync('docs', 'mydocs');
// Rename file in root directory
fs.renameSync(path.join('/', 'input.txt'), path.join('/', 'output.txt'));
fs.renameSync(path.join('/', 'docs'), path.join('/', 'mydocs'));
```
This code uses the `fs` module to rename files and directories in Node.js. It first renames the file and directory in the current working directory, and then renames them in the root directory by joining the root path (`/`) with the relative paths of the files and directories.
