In C, there is no built-in support for filesystem operations and file manipulations as in C++. Therefore, these tasks need to be handled manually.

The following code shows how you can create a new empty file and directory in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int main() {
    FILE *f = fopen("output.txt", "w");
    fclose(f);

    f = fopen("/output.txt", "w");
    fclose(f);
    
    mkdir("docs", 0777);
    mkdir("/docs", 0777);
}
```

Please note that this code does not check for errors and assumes that the user has the necessary permissions to create files and directories in those locations.
