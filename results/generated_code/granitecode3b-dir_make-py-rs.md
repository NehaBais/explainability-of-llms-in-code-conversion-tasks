Sure, here's a Rust function that achieves the same functionality as the Python code:
```
use std::fs;
pub fn mkdirp<P: AsRef<std::ffi::OsStr>>(path: P) -> std::io::Result<()> {
 fs::create_dir_all(path)?;
 Ok(())
}
```
The `mkdirp` function takes a single path string as input, and creates the directory and any missing parents. It returns a `std::io::Result<()>`, indicating whether the operation was successful or not. The implementation uses the `fs::create_dir_all` function from the Rust standard library to achieve this functionality.
