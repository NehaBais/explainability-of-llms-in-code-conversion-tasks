Here is the Rust code that meets the requirements:
```
fn main() {
 let s = "ABCDEFGH";
 let n = 2;
 let m = 3;
 
 // for reference
 println!("Index: {}", "01234567");
 println!("String: {}", s);
 
 // starting from n characters in and of m length
 println!("Start {}, length {}: {}", n, m, &s[n..(n+m)]);
 
 // starting from n characters in, up to the end of the string
 println!("Start {}, to end: {}", n, &s[n..]);
 
 // whole string minus last character
 println!("All but last: {}", &s[..(s.len()-1)]);
 
 // starting from a known character within the string and of m length
 let dx = s.find('D').unwrap();
 println!("Start 'D', length {}: {}", m, &s[dx..(dx+m)]);
 
 // starting from a known substring within the string and of m length
 let sx = s.find("DE").unwrap();
 println!("Start \"DE\", length {}: {}", m, &s[sx..(sx+m)]);
}
```
This code uses Rust's UTF-8 encoding by default, which means it can handle any valid Unicode code point in the Basic Multilingual Plane or above. It also references logical characters (code points) rather than 8-bit code units for UTF-8. The program uses the `find()` method to find the index of a character within the string and the indexing syntax `s[n..(n+m)]` to extract substrings from the input string.
