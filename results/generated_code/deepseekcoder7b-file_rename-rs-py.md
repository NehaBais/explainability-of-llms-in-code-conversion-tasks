The Python code for the same operation would be:

```python
import os
import shutil

def rename_files():
    try:
        # Rename in current working directory
        os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt') 
        os.rename('docs', 'mydocs')  
        
        # Rename in filesystem root ("/")
        shutil.move('/input.txt', '/output.txt')
        shutil.move('/docs', '/mydocs') 
    except Exception as e:
        print("File move error:", str(e))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rename_files()
```

Note that to rename directories in Python, you need the `shutil.move` function, which is equivalent to the Rust's `std::fs::rename` in moving files or directory between locations and renaming it, not just renaming them. 

Also, Python doesn't have a built-in filesystem root ("/") but you can specify it as we did above by giving '/'. In Unix systems, the root of the file system is represented by '/', in Windows it could be 'C:\\'.
