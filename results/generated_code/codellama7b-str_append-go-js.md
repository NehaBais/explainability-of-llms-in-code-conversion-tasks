Here's the equivalent code in JavaScript:
```
const str = "foo";
str += "bar";
console.log(str);
```
Note that in JavaScript, we use the `+=` operator to concatenate strings, whereas in Go, we use the `WriteString()` method of the `strings.Builder` type to append a string to an existing string. Also, in JavaScript, we use the `console.log()` function to print the contents of a variable to the console, whereas in Go, we use the `fmt.Print()` function.
