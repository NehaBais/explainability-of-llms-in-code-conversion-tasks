 Sure, here is the equivalent code in Golang:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	s := "hello"
	fmt.Println(s)
	
	s1 := s + " world"
	fmt.Println(s1)
}
```

In this Go code:
- `s` is a string variable initialized with the value "hello".
- The content of `s` is printed using `fmt.Println(s)`.
- `s1` is created by concatenating " world" to the existing string in `s`.
- The content of `s1` is printed using `fmt.Println(s1)`.
