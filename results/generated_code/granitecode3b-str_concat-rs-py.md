Sure! Here's the Python code that does the same thing as the Rust code:
```
s = "hello"
s1 = s + " world"
print(s)
print(s1)
```
This code creates a string variable `s` equal to the text value `"hello"` and then concatenates it with the string literal `" world"`, creating a new string variable `s1`. The content of `s` is printed first, followed by the content of `s1`.
