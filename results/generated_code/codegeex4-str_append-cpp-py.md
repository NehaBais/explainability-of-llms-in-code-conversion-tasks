The equivalent Python code for the given C++ code is:

```python
greeting = "Hello"
greeting += ", world!"
print(greeting)
```

Explanation:
- In Python, strings are mutable and can be modified in place. Therefore, we don't need to use a function like `append()` but rather we can use the `+=` operator to append strings.
- We don't need to import any library for string operations as everything is built-in.
- Finally, we print out the greeting using the `print()` function.
