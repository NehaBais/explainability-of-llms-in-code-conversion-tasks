 Here is the equivalent Java code for your C++ program:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "hello";
        System.out.println(s + " literal");
        String s2 = s + " literal";
        System.out.println(s2);
    }
}
```
In Java, you can concatenate strings using the `+` operator just like in C++. The rest of the program is written the same way as your C++ example.
