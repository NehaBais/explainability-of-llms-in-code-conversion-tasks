This code compares two strings using the `equals()` and `compareTo()` methods in Java. Here's how you can convert this code to JavaScript:
```
function compare(A, B) {
  if (A === B) {
    console.log(`${A} and ${B} are lexically equal.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`${A} and ${B} are not lexically equal.`);
  }
  if (A.toLowerCase() === B.toLowerCase()) {
    console.log(`${A} and ${B} are case-insensitive lexically equal.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`${A} and ${B} are not case-insensitive lexically equal.`);
  }
  if (A < B) {
    console.log(`${A} is lexically before ${B}.`);
  } else if (A > B) {
    console.log(`${A} is lexically after ${B}.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`${A} is not lexically before or after ${B}.`);
  }
  console.log(`The lexical relationship is: ${A.compareTo(B)}`);
  console.log(`The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: ${A.toLowerCase().compareTo(B.toLowerCase())}`);
}
```
Here's how the code works:

1. The `equals()` method is used to compare two strings for exact equality. If they are equal, it logs a message saying that they are lexically equal.
2. The `compareTo()` method is used to compare two strings for their lexical ordering. If one string comes before the other in lexical order, it logs a message saying that the first string is lexically before the second. If one string comes after the other in lexical order, it logs a message saying that the first string is lexically after the second.
3. The `toLowerCase()` method is used to convert both strings to lowercase before comparing them for case-insensitive equality. If they are equal after converting to lowercase, it logs a message saying that they are case-insensitive lexically equal.
4. The `compareTo()` method is used again to compare the two strings for their lexical ordering, but this time with case-insensitive equality. If one string comes before the other in lexical order after converting to lowercase, it logs a message saying that the first string is case-insensitive lexically before the second. If one string comes after the other in lexical order after converting to lowercase, it logs a message saying that the first string is case-insensitive lexically after the second.
5. The `compareTo()` method is used again to compare the two strings for their lexical ordering without considering case sensitivity. It logs a message saying that the first string is not lexically before or after the second, depending on the result of the comparison.
6. Finally, both comparisons are logged, with the results of both comparisons shown.
