 This code defines several functions for comparing strings in C and C++.

In C, the `STREQ` macro compares two strings for exact equality, while the `STRNE` macro does the inverse (i.e., checks if the strings are not equal). The `STRGT` macro compares two strings to see which one is lexically ordered before the other, and the `STRLT` macro does the opposite. The `STRGE` and `STRLE` macros compare two strings to see which one is lexically ordered after the other.

In C++, the `STREQ` and `STRNE` functions are defined as member functions of the `std::string` class, so they can be used with any string object. The `STRLT`, `STRGT`, `STRGE`, and `STRLE` functions are not defined in C++ and should not be used.

The `compare` function takes two strings as arguments and prints out their lexical comparison results using the `printf` function. The `comparecase` function is similar, but it ignores case when comparing the strings.

In the `main` function, the program uses a loop to iterate over the command-line arguments, calling the `compare` function with each pair of strings. It also calls the `comparecase` function with each pair of strings, and prints out the results using the `printf` function.
