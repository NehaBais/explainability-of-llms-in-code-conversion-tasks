Sure, here's the equivalent Rust code:
```rust
fn main() {
 let extra = "little";
 println!("Mary had a {} lamb.", extra);
}
```
In Rust, you can use string interpolation by enclosing the values or variable names in curly braces (`{}`). The `println!` macro is used to print the interpolated string to the console.
