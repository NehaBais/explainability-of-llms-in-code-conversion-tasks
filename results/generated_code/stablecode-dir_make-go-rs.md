Rust doesn't have a built-in function that mirrors the behavior of `mkdir -p` in Bash or `os.MkdirAll()` in Golang. However, you can implement this functionality yourself using the standard library functions provided by Rust.

Here's an example of how to create a directory and any missing parents in Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn create_directory(path: &str) {
    let path = PathBuf::from(path);

    // Create the parent directories if they don't exist.
    if let Err(e) = fs::create_dir_all(&path)) {
        eprintln!("Failed to create directory: {}", e));
        return;
    }

    println!("Directory created successfully at path: {:?}", path);
}

fn main() {
    let path = "./path/to/dir";
    create_directory(path);
}
```

This Rust code creates a directory and any missing parents. The `create_directory()` function takes a single path string as input, parses it into a `PathBuf` structure, and then uses the `fs::create_dir_all()` function to create the directory and its parent directories if they don't already exist. If any errors occur during the creation process, they are printed to the console using the `eprintln!()` macro.

The code also includes a simple main function that demonstrates how to use the `create_directory()` function. The path string passed to the function is `./path/to/dir`, which represents a hypothetical directory path. You can replace this path string with any other valid directory path string in your Rust program.
