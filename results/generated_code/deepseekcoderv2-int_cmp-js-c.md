 To convert the given JavaScript code to C, we need to handle input, perform integer comparisons, and output the results accordingly. Below is the equivalent C code that performs these tasks:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void compare(int a, int b) {
    if (a == b) {
        printf("%d equals %d\n", a, b);
    } else if (a < b) {
        printf("%d is less than %d\n", a, b);
    } else if (a > b) {
        printf("%d is greater than %d\n", a, b);
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, b;

    // Get two integers from the user
    printf("Enter the first integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &a);
    printf("Enter the second integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &b);

    // Compare the integers and display the result
    compare(a, b);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: In C, we use `scanf` to read integers from the user. The format specifier `%d` is used for integers.
2. **Comparison Logic**: The `compare` function uses simple if-else statements to compare the two integers and print the appropriate message based on their relationship.
3. **Main Function**: In the `main` function, we prompt the user to enter two integers, read them using `scanf`, and then call the `compare` function with these values.

This code assumes that the input provided by the user is valid (i.e., it does not handle invalid inputs like non-integer values). In a production environment, you would typically include error checking to handle such cases gracefully.
