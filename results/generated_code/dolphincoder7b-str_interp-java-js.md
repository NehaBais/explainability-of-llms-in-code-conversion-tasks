The JavaScript version of your Java code is as follows:
```javascript
let adjective = "little";
let lyric = `Mary had a ${adjective} lamb`;
console.log(lyric);
```
In JavaScript, you can use back-ticks (`) to format strings with variables or expressions. The `${}` syntax is used to include the result of an expression inside the string. In this case, the `adjective` variable is included within the string.
