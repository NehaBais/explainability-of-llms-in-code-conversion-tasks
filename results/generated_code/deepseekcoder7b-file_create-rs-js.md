In JavaScript you can use the built-in Node.js "fs" and "path" modules to achieve a similar result as follows -

Please note that Node.js does not have a concept of root directory in a file system like Rust, so the operation will be performed in the current working directory (CWD) by default:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
process.on('unhandledRejection', error => {
    console.error(`Error: ${error}`);
    process.exit(1);
});

const FILE_NAME = "output.txt";
const DIR_NAME  = "docs";

async function createDirAndFile(root) {
  const fPath = path.join(root,FILE_NAME);
  const dPath = path.join(root,DIR_NAME);
  
  fs.promises.mkdir(dPath).then(() => console.log('Directory created')).catch((error)=> errorHandler(error,2));;
  fs.promises.open(fPath, 'w').then(() => console.log('File Created')).catch((error) => errorHandler(error,3));
}

function errorHandler(error, code) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
    process.exit(code)
}

createDirAndFile(".").then(()=>console.log('Done')).catch((error) => errorHandler(error,1));
``` 
This JavaScript code does the following tasks as in your Rust program:
- Creates an empty file named "output.txt" if it doesn't exist already (or truncates it if it exists).
- Creates a directory named "docs" if it doesn't exist.
- This operation is performed twice, first with the current working directory (given by '.') and then when you call 'createDirAndFile(".")'. 
   - If we want to create in root file system, we need to use '/' or a drive letter like C:\\ for Windows as Node.js runs in a similar way on different OS platforms but the exact syntax could be different based on your OS and setup.
- Error handling is done by catching any errors and passing them off to the errorHandler function along with a code representing what operation failed (1 = main createDirAndFile, 2 = mkdir, 3 = open). The error message is written to stderr then process exits with that provided code.  

Note: Node.js has async nature and it uses Promise for this kind of operations. So we have used 'async/await' syntax in our program for cleaner look and feel.
