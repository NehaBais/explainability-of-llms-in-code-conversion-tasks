In JavaScript, you can use the logical operators `&&`, `||`, and `!` to perform the required operations. Here's the equivalent JavaScript function:

```javascript
function printLogic(a, b) {
    console.log("a and b is", a && b);
    console.log("a or b is", a || b);
    console.log("not a is", !a);
}
```

This code defines a function `printLogic` that takes two boolean parameters `a` and `b`, and logs the results of "and", "or", and "not" operations on these values.
