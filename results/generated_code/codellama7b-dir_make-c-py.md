Here is the equivalent Python code for the given C code:
```
import os
import stat
from pathlib import Path

def create_directory(path):
    # Create a directory and any missing parents.
    # This task is named after the posix mkdir -p command, and several libraries which implement the same behavior.
    try:
        Path(path).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    except OSError as e:
        print("Couldn't create directory {}: {}".format(path, e))
        return False
    return True
```
This code uses the `os` module to manipulate the file system and the `stat` module to check if a path exists. It also uses the `Path` class from the `pathlib` module to create the directory and any missing parents. The function returns `True` if the directory was created successfully, or `False` otherwise.

In this code, we first convert the input `path` argument to a `Path` object using the `Path()` constructor. Then we use the `mkdir()` method of the `Path` object to create the directory and any missing parents. The `parents=True` parameter tells `mkdir()` to create any missing parents, and the `exist_ok=True` parameter tells it not to raise an error if the directory already exists.

If there is an error while creating the directory, we catch the exception using a try-except block and print an error message to the console. We then return `False` to indicate that the directory could not be created.

Note that this code assumes that the input `path` argument is a string containing a valid file system path. If the input is invalid or does not exist, the code will raise an exception when trying to convert it to a `Path` object.
