### Pseudocode:

mkdirs(dir: string) {
    if (dir == "")
        return;

    mkdirs(get_parent(dir));
    create_directory(dir);
}


### Code
```rust
use std::fs::{create_dir, read_dir};
use std::path::PathBuf;
use std::error::Error;

fn mkdirs<P: AsRef<Path>>(dir: P) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let mut path = PathBuf::from(dir.as_ref());

    while !path.exists() {
        create_dir(&path)?;

        // Move one level up in the directory hierarchy.
        path.pop();
    }

    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    let dir = "path/to/dir";

    match mkdirs(dir) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Created directory {} successfully", dir),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error creating directory: {}", e),
    }
}
```

In Rust, there's no built-in function for creating directories with missing parents. However, this can be easily implemented by checking if the directory already exists, and recursively creating its parent directories using a loop until it finds the root directory or creates all of them successfully. The `create_dir` function in Rust returns an error if the directory creation fails so we need to use a `Result` with a custom error type to handle this situation gracefully.

Note: This solution is platform-dependent because it uses the filesystem functions provided by the standard library. If you want to make sure your program works on all platforms, you should write cross-platform code or use a 3rd party crate for creating directories with missing parents.

### Code explanation
1. `mkdirs` function takes a single path string as argument.
2. We create an empty path buffer and convert the input to a path type by calling `AsRef::as_ref`.
3. We enter a loop until we find an existing directory or reach the root directory.
4. Inside the loop, we create the current directory using the `create_dir` function. If the directory creation fails (for example, because of a permission problem), we immediately exit from the loop and return this error.
5. After creating all directories successfully, we remove one level up in the hierarchy by calling `pop`.
6. Finally, we return the result of the entire operation wrapped in a `Result` type to make it easier to handle errors. 

This is a basic example of how to use the `mkdirs` function. It will create the given directory and its missing parents, or print an error message if any step fails.
