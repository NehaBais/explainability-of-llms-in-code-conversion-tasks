Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for the given JavaScript snippet:

```python
original = "Mary had a X lamb"
little = "little"
replaced = original.replace("X", little) # does not change the original string
print(replaced)
```

When you run this program, it will print:

Mary had a little lamb

As expected.
