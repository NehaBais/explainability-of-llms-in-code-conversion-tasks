Here's the JavaScript code that achieves the same result as the Python code:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const inputPath = path.join(__dirname, 'input.txt');
const rootInputPath = '/input.txt';
 
try {
 const size1 = fs.statSync(inputPath).size;
 const size2 = fs.statSync(rootInputPath).size;
 console.log(`Size of input.txt in current working directory: ${size1}`);
 console.log(`Size of input.txt in file system root: ${size2}`);
} catch (err) {
 console.error('Error:', err.message);
}
```
This code uses the `fs` module to access the file system and the `path` module to construct the paths to the files. It first constructs the path to the file in the current working directory by joining the directory name (`__dirname`) with the file name `'input.txt'`. Then, it constructs the path to the same file in the file system root as `'input.txt'`, but with a leading `/` character. 
The `try-catch` block handles any errors that may occur while accessing the files. If an error occurs, it is logged to the console. Otherwise, the size of each file is obtained using the `statSync()` method and logged to the console.
