Here is the converted code from Java to C++:
```
void logic(bool a, bool b){
 std::cout << "a AND b: " << (a && b) << std::endl;
 std::cout << "a OR b: " << (a || b) << std::endl;
 std::cout << "NOT a: " << (!a) << std::endl;
}
``` 
Note that in C++, the logical operators `&&`, `||`, and `!` are used instead of `and`, `or`, and `not` respectively. Also, the `std::cout` statement is used instead of `System.out.println()`.
