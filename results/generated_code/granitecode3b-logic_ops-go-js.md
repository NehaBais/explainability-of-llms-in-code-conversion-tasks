Sure! Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given function:
```javascript
function printLogic(a, b) {
 console.log("a and b is " + (a && b));
 console.log("a or b is " + (a || b));
 console.log("not a is " + (!a));
}
```
This code will output the same result as the Golang code, with the additional benefit of being in JavaScript syntax. The `console.log` function is used to print out the results to the console.
