Sure! Here's the JavaScript code that does the same thing as the Python code you provided:
```javascript
const extra = 'little';
const newStr = `Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`;
console.log(newStr);
```
In JavaScript, string interpolation is achieved using template literals (enclosed in backticks). The `${}` syntax allows us to insert variables or values into the string at runtime. In this case, we use the `extra` variable and its value "little" as part of the interpolation routine. When we run the code, it will output:

Mary had a little lamb.
