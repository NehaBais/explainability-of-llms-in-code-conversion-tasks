Here's the equivalent code in Go:
```go
func logic(a, b bool) {
	fmt.Println("a AND b:", a && b)
	fmt.Println("a OR b:", a || b)
	fmt.Println("NOT a:", !a)
}
```
Note that in Go, you don't need to use the `System.out` statement to print output, as the `fmt` package is used instead. Also, in Go, the `&&` and `||` operators are used for logical AND and OR operations, respectively. Finally, the `!` operator is used for logical NOT operations.
