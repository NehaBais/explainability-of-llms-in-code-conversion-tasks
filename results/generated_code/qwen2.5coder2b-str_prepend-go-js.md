Sure! Here's how you can convert the provided Go code snippet into JavaScript:

```javascript
let s = "world!";
s = `Hello, ${s}`;
```

In this JavaScript code:
- The variable `s` is initialized with the value `"world!"`.
- The string `"Hello, "` is concatenated to the beginning of `s` using template literals. The `${}` syntax in JavaScript allows for embedding expressions inside strings.

This will output:

Hello, world!
