 The first code in Rust is using the `Add` trait to perform addition operation on a string, which makes it more complex than simple string concatenation in Python. Here's how you could achieve this same result in Python:

```python
hello = "Hello world" + "!!!!!"  # append two strings together
print(hello)  # print the new combined string
```
In the second code, we used the `push_str` method to add another string at the end of an existing one. The Python version would be:

hello = "Hello world"
hello += "!!!!!"  # append two strings together
print(hello)  # print the new combined string
