Sure, here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given C code snippet:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
// Verify the size of a file called input.txt for a file in the current working directory
const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'input.txt');
const stats = fs.statSync(filePath);
console.log(stats.size); // prints the size of the file in bytes
// Verify the size of a file called input.txt for a file in the file system root
const rootPath = '/input.txt';
const rootStats = fs.statSync(rootPath);
console.log(rootStats.size); // prints the size of the file in bytes
```
This JavaScript code uses the `fs` module to read the size of a file, and the `path` module to construct the paths for both the current working directory and the root directory. The `statSync()` function is used to retrieve the size of the file, and it is printed to the console using `console.log()`.
