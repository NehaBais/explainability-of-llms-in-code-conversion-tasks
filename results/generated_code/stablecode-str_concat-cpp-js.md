Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your C++ code:

```javascript
let s = "hello";
console.log(s + ' literal'));

let s2 = s + ' literal';
console.log(s2));
```

This JavaScript code will perform exactly the same as your given C++ code. It concatenates two string literals ('literal')) and then prints out the result. The second part of your requirement is also implemented in this JavaScript code by creating a new string variable 's2' which stores the value of 's' (original string) + another string literal (' literal'). The content of 's2' is printed to the console using console.log().

Note: In JavaScript, you can concatenate strings using '+'. JavaScript also provides an in-built function called 'console.log()', which allows us to print out the value of a given variable or expression on the console.
