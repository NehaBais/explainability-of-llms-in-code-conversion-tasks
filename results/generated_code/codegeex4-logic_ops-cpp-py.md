Here's how you can convert the given C++ code to Python:

```python
def print_logic(a, b):
    # so that bools are written as True and False
    print("a and b is", a and b)
    print("a or b is", a or b)
    print("not a is", not a)
```

This function works similarly to the original C++ code. It takes two boolean arguments, and it prints out the results of "and" and "or" on both arguments as well as "not" on the first argument. In Python, `and`, `or` and `not` are used for logical operations in a similar way to C++.
