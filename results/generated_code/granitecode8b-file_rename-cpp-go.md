Here's the Golang code that achieves the same requirements as the C++ code:
```
package main
import (
 "fmt"
 "os"
)
func main() {
 err := os.Rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
 if err != nil {
 fmt.Println(err)
 }
 err = os.Rename("docs", "mydocs")
 if err != nil {
 fmt.Println(err)
 }
 err = os.Rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
 if err != nil {
 fmt.Println(err)
 }
 err = os.Rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
 if err != nil {
 fmt.Println(err)
 }
}
```
This code uses the `os.Rename` function from the Golang standard library to rename files and directories. The ` Rename` function takes two arguments: the old path and the new path. In this case, we are renaming "input.txt" to "output.txt", "docs" to "mydocs", "/input.txt" to "/output.txt", and "/docs" to "/mydocs".
The code also checks for any errors that may occur during the rename operation using the `err` variable. If an error occurs, it is printed to the console using `fmt.Println`. This ensures that the user is aware of any issues with renaming the files or directories.
