Sure! Here's the Java code that performs the same operation as the C code:
```java
package com.example;
public class Concatenation {
 
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  String s = "hello";
  String s2 = s + " literal";
  
  System.out.println("C Code:");
  System.out.println("s: " + s);
  System.out.println("s2: " + s2);
  
  s2 = concatenate(s, " literal");
  System.out.println("Java Code:");
  System.out.println("s2: " + s2);
 }
 
 public static String concatenate(String str1, String str2) {
  return str1 + str2;
 }
}
```
The output of the Java code will be:

C Code:
s: hello
s2: hello literal
Java Code:
s2: hello literal

As you can see, the Java code performs the same operation as the C code by concatenating two string variables.
