Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your C++ code:

```javascript
let original = "Mary had a X lamb.";
let toBeReplaced = "X";
let replacement = "little";

let newString = original.replace(original.indexOf(toBeReplaced), toBeReplaced.length, replacement);

console.log("String after replacement: ", newString);
```

This JavaScript code performs the same string interpolation as your C++ code.
