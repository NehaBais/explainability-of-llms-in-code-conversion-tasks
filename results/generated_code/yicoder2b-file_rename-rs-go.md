The provided Rust code is to rename a file named "input.txt" into "output.txt" and directory "docs" into "mydocs". However, Rust does not support renaming files/directories at filesystem root level as it treats the root path as an absolute path without relative path prefixes and it doesn't have concept of current working directory like Bash or Windows command prompt.

The code is incorrect because the `rename()` function in Rust takes two paths as arguments: a source and a destination, not paths to directories in different filesystem roots.

Also, Rust does not support renaming files/directories at root level without absolute path prefixes. 

To solve the problem using Rust, you can move your current working directory to the root filesystem before attempting to rename any file or directory there. Here's how you would do it in Rust:

```rust
extern crate super::fs; // This will be able to call the filesystem methods on fs crate (or standard library)

fn main() {
    let err = "File move error";
    // Get current directory path and change into root, if possible.
    if let Some(root_path) = getenv("HOME"){
        if let Ok(_) = std::fs::set_current_dir(root_path) {
            match (fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt"), 
                   fs::rename("docs", "mydocs")){
                Ok((src1, dst1)) => println!("Successfully renamed {} to {}", src1, dst1),
                Err(_e) => (),
            }?;
        } else {
            println!("Cannot change directories.");
        }
    }else{
        println!("Cannot find HOME environment variable. Cannot proceed to the root directory.");
    }
}
``` 

Please note that if your operating system doesn't support this kind of operations, the Rust program may fail or print an error message.
