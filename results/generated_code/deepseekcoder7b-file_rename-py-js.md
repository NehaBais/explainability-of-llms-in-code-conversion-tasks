The JavaScript code for renaming files and directories can be achieved through the "fs" module in NodeJS, however it does not have direct equivalent of os.rename(). The fs.rename() function is used to change the name or location of a file/directory. Here's how you could do that:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');

// rename current directory files and directories
fs.rename("input.txt", "output.txt", function(err) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('input.txt has been renamed to output.txt');
});

fs.rename("docs", "mydocs", function(err) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('docs has been renamed to mydocs');
});

// rename root directory files and directories, you'll need to run the script in an appropriate location like '/'  or 'C:\' .
fs.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt", function(err) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('/input.txt has been renamed to /output.txt');
});

fs.rename("/docs", "/mydocs", function(err) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('/docs has been renamed to /mydocs');
});
```
Please note that the second argument for fs.rename() is a new path string, not an absolute path. Also, since JavaScript runs in NodeJS environment and it operates based on file system paths which may vary based on your OS or File System, so this solution works assuming you are running this script at root of your filesystem ("/") in Linux-based systems for example.
