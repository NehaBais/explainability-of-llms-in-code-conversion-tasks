```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dirent.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <limits.h>

void print_file_size(const char* filename)  {
    struct stat st;

    if (stat(filename, &st) != -1)  {
        printf("Size of file %s is %ld bytes.\n", filename, (long)st.st_size);
    } else {
        perror(filename);
    }
}

int main()  {
    print_file_size("input.txt");
    print_file_size("/input.txt");

    return 0;
}
```

1. The `print_file_size` function is defined to take a filename as an input parameter and print the size of that file in bytes along with the filename. It uses the `stat` system call to get information about a file, including its size. If the file exists and can be opened for reading, it returns the file size; otherwise, an error message is printed using the `perror` function.

2. The `main` function calls `print_file_size` twice with different filenames: "input.txt" and "/input.txt". These are both relative paths to files in the current working directory and the root file system, respectively.

Note that this code is based on POSIX-compliant C functions and does not use the `<filesystem>` library in C++. To convert this code to C++, you would need to define a `print_file_size` function in a header file or include a `<filesystem>` definition. This may require additional platform-specific adaptations, such as using the `__gnu_cxx::filesystem` namespace in GCC instead of the std::filesystem namespace.
