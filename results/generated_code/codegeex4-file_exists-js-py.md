You can use Python's built-in os module to achieve this.

Here's the equivalent code in Python:

```python
import os

def check_existence(path):
    if os.path.isfile(path) or os.path.isdir(path):
        print(f"{path} exists")
    else:
        print(f"{path} does not exist")

# Check for file and directory in current working directory
check_existence('input.txt')
check_existence('docs')

# Check for file and directory in filesystem root (this will raise an error if you do not have permissions)
try:
    check_existence('/input.txt')  # Note: This might need to be adjusted depending on your OS
    check_existence('/docs')
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

Please note that this code won't work on Windows due to lack of permission to access the root directory. You may have to adjust the path for '/input.txt' and '/docs'.
