In Python you can use the "+" operator to concatenate strings, or you can use the `format` function for string interpolation. Here's how it can be done in Python:

```python
hello = "Hello world"
hello += "!!!!"
print(hello)  # Outputs: Hello world!!!!
```
Alternatively, you could use the `format` function for a more dynamic and flexible approach.

hello = "Hello world{}".format("!!!!")
print(hello)  # Outputs: Hello world!!!!
