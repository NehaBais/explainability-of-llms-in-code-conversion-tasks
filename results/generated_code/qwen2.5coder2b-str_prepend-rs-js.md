Sure! Here's how you can convert the Rust code to JavaScript:

```javascript
let s = "World";
s = "Hello " + s;
console.log(s);
```

In this JavaScript code:
- We start by declaring a variable `s` and assign it the value `"World"`.
- We then use the `insert_str` method (which doesn't exist in JavaScript, we will concatenate strings instead) to prepend the string `"Hello "` to `s`.
- Finally, we use `console.log` to print the updated value of `s`.
