The Python version of the given Golang code is as follows:

```python
import os

def main():
    os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt')
    os.rename('docs', 'mydocs')
    os.rename('/input.txt', '/output.txt')
    os.rename('/docs', '/mydocs')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
In Python, the `os` module provides the necessary functions for renaming files and directories, including:

1. `os.rename(src, dst)` - renames a file or directory. It takes two arguments: `src`, which is the original name (source) of the file or directory, and `dst`, which is the new name (destination).
2. The `os` module also provides several other functions for interacting with the filesystem. For example, `os.chdir(path)` changes the current working directory to `path`. 
3. It can be assumed that the user has the rights to do so because Python runs as root by default when running under a Unix-like system.

To rename the file "input.txt" into "output.txt", you would use: `os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")`. Similarly, to rename the directory "docs" into "mydocs", you can use `os.rename("docs", "mydocs")`.

To rename the file "/input.txt" into "/output.txt" and the directory "/docs" into "/mydocs", you would need to change the current working directory to "/" (the filesystem root) first: `os.chdir("/")` and then execute `os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")` and `os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")`.

Please note that the `/` symbol is used in Python to represent the root of the filesystem, not a separator. The above code will work as expected assuming the user has appropriate permissions for changing into the root directory and renaming files/directories there.
