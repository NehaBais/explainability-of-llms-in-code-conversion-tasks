Here's the Python version of your code:

```python
# Get two integers from the user
a = int(input("Enter first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter second integer: "))

# Display a message if the first integer is less than the second
if (a < b):
    print(a, "is less than", b)

# Display a message if the first integer is equal to the second
if (a == b):
    print(a, "is equal to", b)

# Display a message if the first integer is greater than the second
if (a > b):
    print(a, "is greater than", b)
```

This Python code does exactly the same thing as your original C code. It asks the user for two integers and then compares them with each of the three comparison operators. If a condition is true, it prints out the appropriate message.
