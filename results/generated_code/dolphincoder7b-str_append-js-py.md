To convert the JavaScript code to Python, we can use a simple approach with string concatenation and the `+` operator. Here's the equivalent code in Python:
```python
s1 = "Hello"
s1 += ", World!"  # Append with + operator
print(s1)
```
In this example, the variable `s1` is initialized with the string literal `"Hello"`, and then we append another string using the `+=` operator. The `+` operator concatenates two strings together, just like JavaScript does. Finally, we print the updated value of `s1`.
