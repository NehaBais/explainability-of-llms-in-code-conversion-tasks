Here is how you can convert the given C code to Python:
```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value.
text = "Good Morning"

# Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way.
text += " to all"
text += " !!!

# Show the contents of the variable after the append operation.
print(text)
```
This Python code achieves the same result as the C code. It starts by creating a string variable `text` and assigning it the value `"Good Morning"`. Then, it appends another string literal to this variable using the `+=` operator, which is the most idiomatic way in Python for appending strings. Finally, it prints the contents of the variable after the append operation.
