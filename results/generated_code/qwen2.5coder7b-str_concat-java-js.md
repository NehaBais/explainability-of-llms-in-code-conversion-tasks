Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Java code:

```javascript
let s = "hello";
console.log(s + " literal");
let s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```

In this JavaScript code, `let` is used to declare a variable. The variable `s` is declared and initialized with the string value `"hello"`. Then it is printed on console followed by another string literal `" literal"`.

Then `s2` is declared and initialized as concatenation of `s` and `" literal"` which gives the final output as `"hello literal"` and then it's also printed on console.
