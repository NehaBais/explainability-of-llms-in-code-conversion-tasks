Sure, here's how you can write this in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    string s = "world!";
    s = "Hello, " + s;
    cout << s << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This C++ code does the same thing as your Go code. It creates a string variable called `s` and assigns it the value `"Hello, world!"`.
