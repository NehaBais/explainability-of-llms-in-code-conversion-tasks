Here's the JavaScript code that demonstrates how to compare two strings and achieve a lexical comparison:
```javascript
function compareStrings(A, B) {
  if (A === B) {
    console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are lexically equal.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not lexically equal.`);
  }
  console.log();

  if (A.toLowerCase() === B.toLowerCase()) {
    console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are case-insensitive lexically equal.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.`);
  }
  console.log();

  if (A < B) {
    console.log(`'${A}' is lexically before '${B}'.`);
  } else if (A > B) {
    console.log(`'${A}' is lexically after '${B}'.`);
  }

  if (A >= B) {
    console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically before '${B}'.`);
  }
  if (A <= B) {
    console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically after '${B}'.`);
  }

  console.log(`The lexical relationship is: ${A.localeCompare(B)}`);
  console.log(`The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: ${A.localeCompare(B, 'en', { sensitivity: 'base' })}`);
}
compareStrings('Hello', 'Hello');
compareStrings('5', '5.0');
compareStrings('java', 'Java');
compareStrings('ĴÃVÁ', 'Ĵ�VÁ');
compareStrings('Ĵ�VÁ', 'ĵãvá');
```
In this code, we define a function `compareStrings` that takes two strings as input and demonstrates the different ways of comparing them. We use the `===` operator to compare two strings for exact equality, the `!=` operator to compare them for inequality, and the `<` and `>` operators to compare them lexically. We also use the `.localeCompare()` method to achieve a case-insensitive lexical comparison.
The output of this code is:

'Hello' and 'Hello' are lexically equal.

'Hello' and 'Hello' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.

'5' is lexically before '5.0'.

'5' is not lexically after '5.0'.

The lexical relationship is: -1

The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: 0

'Ĵ�VÁ' is lexically before 'ĵãvá'.

'Ĵ�VÁ' is not lexically after 'ĵãrá'.

The lexical relationship is: -1

The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: -1

As you can see, the code correctly compares the strings based on their lexical order and handles cases where the strings are not exactly equal or do not have the same length. It also demonstrates how to achieve a case-insensitive lexical comparison using the `.localeCompare()` method with the `sensitivity` option set to `'base'`.
