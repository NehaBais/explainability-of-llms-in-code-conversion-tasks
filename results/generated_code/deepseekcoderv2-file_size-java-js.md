 Here's the equivalent JavaScript code to verify the size of files as described in your Java code:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function getFileSize(filePath) {
    try {
        const stats = fs.statSync(filePath);
        console.log(`%,d B`, stats.size);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(`Error getting size of ${filePath}:`, err.message);
    }
}

// Check file in the current working directory
getFileSize(path.join(__dirname, 'file.txt'));

// Check file in the root directory
getFileSize('/file.txt');
```

This JavaScript code uses Node.js modules to handle file operations. It first requires the `fs` and `path` modules, then defines a function `getFileSize` that takes a file path as an argument. The function tries to get the size of the file using `fs.statSync`, and if successful, it prints the size in bytes with commas as thousand separators. If there's an error (e.g., the file does not exist), it catches the error and logs a message indicating the failure.
