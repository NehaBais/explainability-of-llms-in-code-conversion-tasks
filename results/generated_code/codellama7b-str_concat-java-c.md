In Java, we can create a string variable by using the "String" class and assigning it to a variable using the assignment operator "=" .
To concatenate a string with another string, we use the + operator.
Here is an example of how to create two string variables in Java:

String s = "hello";
String s2 = s + "literal";
System.out.println(s);
System.out.println(s2);

In C, we can use a similar approach but with some differences.
To create a string variable, we need to use the "char" type and assign it to a variable using the assignment operator "=". To concatenate two strings, we use the "strcat" function.
Here is an example of how to create two string variables in C:
```c
char *s = "hello";
char s2[64];
strcpy(s2, s);
strcat(s2, "literal");
printf("%s\n", s);
printf("%s\n", s2);
```
Note that in C, strings are represented as arrays of characters, and the "strcat" function is used to concatenate two strings. Also, we need to use the "char *" type to represent a string variable in C.
