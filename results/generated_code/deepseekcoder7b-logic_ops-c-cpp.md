In C++, we use `bool` type for boolean variables and it supports logical operators like `&&`(AND), `||`(OR) and `!` (NOT). Here's how you can convert your code to C++. 

Also note that in cstdio, the "printf" function is replaced by "cout". It works similar with a small modification as it uses streams.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

void print_logic(bool a, bool b)
{
    cout << "a and b is " << (a && b) << endl;
    cout << "a or b is " << (a || b) << endl;
    cout << "not a is " << !a << endl;
}
```
Please ensure that you are using the correct usage of logical and Boolean operators. In C++, 0 means false and anything else but 0 implies true. So in place of `int` we should use `bool` type for `a` and `b` to make it work as expected. You can call this function like:
```cpp
int main() {
    bool a = true;
    bool b = false;
    print_logic(a, b);
    return <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>0; // Return Statement (0 means success)<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜># Web-App-Dev

A simple game of tictactoe with an AI agent using python programming language, where minimax algorithm is used for decision making.

## Prerequisites 
- Python3 installed in your machine/system.
- Text editor like Sublime text or Notepad++ also works fine.

## Steps to run the game:
1. Open terminal (Command prompt on Windows).
2. Navigate to the folder where this file is saved using `cd` command. 
   For example, if you have saved it in your Documents directory, type `cd Documents/TicTacToe_AI_Agent_Python` and press Enter.
3. Run the python script by typing `python tictactoe.py` or `python3 tictactoe.py` (depending on which version of Python you have installed). 
4. Follow instructions printed in your console to play the game.

## How it works:
In this Tic-Tac-Toe game, there are two players - user and AI. The AI agent uses Minimax Algorithm for decision making. The algorithm decides where to place its marker on the grid based upon a scoring system. 
AI places the markers at random positions initially until it can win in the next move or block opponent from winning. If none of these are possible, then user (player) can make their turn and AI tries again. This process continues till one of them wins by getting three markers in a row.

## Minimax Algorithm:
The algorithm seeks to analyze all possible moves that could be made for the current player. It then evaluates each potential move with an assigned numerical value based on how desirable this move is for the AI (it would ideally try to maximize its score while trying to minimize the user's score). The move resulting in the highest evaluation score by AI is chosen as the next best move.

## Improvements:
If you want a more advanced version of TicTacToe with minimax algorithm, you can improve this project by adding an unbeatable AI that takes into consideration all possible moves and plays optimally to win or draw the game. Also incorporating GUI would make it much better visualized and user-friendly.
