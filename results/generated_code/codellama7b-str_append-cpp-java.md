Here's the code in Java:
```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String greeting = "Hello";
        greeting += ", world!";
        System.out.println(greeting);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* In Java, you can append a string to another string using the `+=` operator.
* The `std::string` type in C++ is equivalent to the `String` class in Java.
* The `std::cout` object in C++ is equivalent to the `System.out` object in Java.
* The `main()` method in C++ is equivalent to the `public static void main(String[] args)` method in Java, which is the entry point of the program.
