I'm sorry for the confusion but Python doesn't have built-in file system functionality like Java does. Therefore, I can only provide the equivalent functionality in Python using standard libraries such as `os` and `pathlib`.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import os

def main():
    file_a = "file.txt"  # Assume file is in current working directory
    print(f"File A size: {os.path.getsize(file_a)} bytes")

    file_b = "/file.txt"  # Assume file is in the root of the file system
    print(f"File B size: {os.path.getsize(file_b)} bytes")
```

In Python, files are treated as objects that represent external entities such as text, images or other data formats. These objects have properties and methods (functions) for various operations related to the file object itself. For instance, you can use `os` module's `pathlib` function to get the size of a file in bytes.

    import os
    from pathlib import Path

    # Get absolute path of file A in current working directory 
    file_a = Path("file.txt").resolve()
    print(f"File A size: {os.path.getsize(file_a)} bytes")

    # Get absolute path of file B in the root of the file system 
    file_b = Path("/file.txt").resolve()
    print(f"File B size: {os.path.getsize(file_b)} bytes")

Remember that you need to have these two files (`file.txt` and `/file.txt`) in your current working directory for the code above to work correctly. 

Please note, this is a very basic demonstration of Python's file handling capabilities and doesn't cover advanced topics like handling different types of exceptions or dealing with directories. Depending on how you're using these files, you might want to add some more specific error checking and handle directory creation. Please consider referring to the documentation for further details.
