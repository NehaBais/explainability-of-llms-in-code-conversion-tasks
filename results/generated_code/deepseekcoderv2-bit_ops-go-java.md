 Sure! Below is the equivalent Java code for the provided Go program:

```java
public class BitwiseOperations {
    public static void bitwise(int a, int b) {
        System.out.printf("a:   %016s%n", Integer.toBinaryString(a));
        System.out.printf("b:   %016s%n", Integer.toBinaryString(b));

        // Bitwise logical operations
        System.out.printf("and: %016s%n", Integer.toBinaryString(a & b));
        System.out.printf("or:  %016s%n", Integer.toBinaryString(a | b));
        System.out.printf("xor: %016s%n", Integer.toBinaryString(a ^ b));
        System.out.printf("not: %016s%n", Integer.toBinaryString(~a));

        if (b < 0) {
            System.out.println("Right operand is negative, but all shifts require an unsigned right operand (shift distance).");
            return;
        }
        int ua = a & 0xFFFF; // Ensure the number is treated as unsigned for shifts
        int ub = b & 0x1F;    // Shift distance should be within 0 to 31

        // Logical shifts (unsigned left operand)
        System.out.printf("shl: %016s%n", Integer.toBinaryString(ua << ub));
        System.out.printf("shr: %016s%n", Integer.toBinaryString(ua >> ub));

        // Arithmetic shifts (signed left operand)
        System.out.printf("las: %016s%n", Integer.toBinaryString((short) (a << ub)));
        System.out.printf("ras: %016s%n", Integer.toBinaryString((short) (a >> ub)));

        // Rotations
        int rol = (ua << ub) | ((ua >> (16 - ub)) & 0xFFFF);
        int ror = ((ua >> ub) & 0xFFFF) | (ua << (16 - ub));
        System.out.printf("rol: %016s%n", Integer.toBinaryString(rol));
        System.out.printf("ror: %016s%n", Integer.toBinaryString(ror));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = -460;
        int b = 6;
        bitwise(a, b);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Bitwise Logical Operations**: The `&`, `|`, and `^` operations are performed using the same operators in Java as in Go.
2. **Bitwise NOT**: In Java, the bitwise NOT operator is represented by the tilde (`~`) sign.
3. **Shifts and Rotations**: 
   - Logical left shift (`shl`) is done using `<<`.
   - Logical right shift (`shr`) is done using `>>` for unsigned values or with casting to `int` if necessary for signed values.
   - Arithmetic left shift (`las`) is the same as logical left shift since Java treats integers as signed by default.
   - Arithmetic right shift (`ras`) is performed by first casting to a wider type (e.g., `int`) and then shifting, ensuring that the sign bit is preserved.
4. **Rotation**: Java does not have built-in support for rotations like Go, so custom operations are implemented as combinations of shifts and logical or (`|`).

This code should provide equivalent functionality to the original Go program when run with the same inputs.
