To convert the Rust code to Python, you would use the `os` module. Here's how you can rewrite the code:

```python
import os

def main():
    err = "File move error"

    # Moving files in the current directory
    os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
    os.rename("docs", "mydocs")

    # Moving files at the root level
    os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
    os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does exactly the same thing as your Rust code. It uses the `os.rename` function to move the files. The `/input.txt`, `/docs`, `/output.txt`, and `/mydocs` are used when moving the files at the root level, which is why they start with a forward slash.
