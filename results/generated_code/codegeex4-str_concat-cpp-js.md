Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your C++ code:

```javascript
// Create a string variable equal to any text value.
let s = "hello";

// Concatenate it with another string literal and store it in another variable.
let s2 = s + " literal";

// Print the original variable and concatenated result respectively.
console.log(s + " literal");
console.log(s2);
```
