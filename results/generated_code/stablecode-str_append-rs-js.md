The equivalent code in JavaScript would be:

```javascript
var hello = "Hello world";
console.log(hello + "!!!"));
```
In this JavaScript version, we declare the variable `hello` and assign it the string value "Hello world". Then, similar to Rust's `println!()` function, we use `console.log()` to print the concatenated string to the console. 

Note that in Javascript '+' operator is used for both addition and string concatenation.
