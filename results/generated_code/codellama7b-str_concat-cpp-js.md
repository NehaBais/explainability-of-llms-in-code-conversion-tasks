 Here is the code in JavaScript:
```
const s = 'hello';
console.log(s, 'literal'); // Outputs 'hello literal'
const s2 = s + ' literal';
console.log(s2); // Outputs 'hello literal'
return 0;
```
Note that in JavaScript, strings are concatenated using the `+` operator, whereas in C++, it is done with the `<<` operator. Also, in C++, `std::cout` is used to print to the console, while in JavaScript, we use `console.log()` instead.
