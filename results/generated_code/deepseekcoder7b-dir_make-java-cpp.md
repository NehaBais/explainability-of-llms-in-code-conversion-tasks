In C++, you can use the `boost::filesystem` library to achieve this functionality. Here is your Java code translated into a C++ function using `mkdir()` and `mkpath()` functions of boost filesystem:

C++ Code :

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>
namespace fs = boost::filesystem;

void create_directory(const std::string& path) 
{
    fs::path dir(path);
    
    if(!fs::exists(dir))
    {
        if(fs::create_directories(dir))
            std::cout << "Path successfully created" << std::endl;
    } 
}

int main() {
    create_directory("C:/parent/test");
     return 0;
}
```
Please note that for using boost::filesystem, make sure to include it in your project and link against it. Additionally, the library might require administrator privileges to be able to create directories at arbitrary locations. For cross-platform compatibility, you can use CMake or other build systems to handle this for you. 

Also note that, unlike Javaâ€™s File class, Boost Filesystem does not support URIs directly. If using boost::filesystem in a project with C++17 filesystem support (available starting from gcc-8), the code can be simplified:

#include <iostream>
#include <filesystem>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;

void create_directory(const std::string& path) 
{
    fs::path dir(path);
    
    if(!fs::exists(dir))
    {
        if(fs::create_directories(dir))
            std::cout << "Path successfully created" << std::endl;
    } 
}

You can call the `create_directory()` in your main function as above. Please ensure to include C++17 filesystem library with compiler flag -std=c++17 or later if you are using CMake, add this line: `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)`
