To convert the given C++ code to Python, we can make use of the built-in `str` type in Python. Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
s = "hello"
print(s + " literal")
s2 = s + " literal"
print(s2)
```

In this code, `s` is a string variable that holds the value `"hello"`, and `s2` is another string variable that holds the result of concatenating `s` with another string literal. The `+` operator in Python is used to concatenate strings.

When you run this Python code, it will output:

hello literal
helliteral


The content of the variables can be seen as expected.
