Sure, here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Rust code:

```javascript
function main() {
    console.log(`Mary had a ${"little"} lamb`);
    console.log(`${"little"} had a ${"Mary"} lamb`);
    console.log(`"${name} had a ${adj} lamb"`); // If you want to use named arguments
}

main();
```

This will print out:

Mary had a little lamb
little had a Mary lamb
Mary had a little lamb
