Here's how you can convert the given Java code to C++. Note that C++ does not have a built-in `equals` method as in Java. Instead, you can use the `==` operator for exact equality comparison. For case-insensitive comparison, you'll need to convert both strings to either lower or upper case before comparing them.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm> // For transform function

void compare(std::string A, std::string B)
{
    if (A == B) {
        std::cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B << "' are lexically equal." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B << "' are not lexically equal." << std::endl;
    }

    // Convert strings to lower case for case-insensitive comparison
    std::transform(A.begin(), A.end(), A.begin(),
                   [](unsigned char c){ return std::tolower(c); });
    std::transform(B.begin(), B.end(), B.begin(),
                   [](unsigned char c){ return std::tolower(c); });

    if (A == B) {
        std::cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B << "' are case-insensitive lexically equal." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "'" << A << "' and '" << B << "' are not case-insensitive lexically equal." << std::endl;
    }

    // Reset original strings
    std::transform(A.begin(), A.end(), A.begin(),
                   [](unsigned char c){ return std::toupper(c); });
    std::transform(B.begin(), B.end(), B.begin(),
                   [](unsigned char c){ return std::toupper(c); });

    if (A < B) {
        std::cout << "'" << A << "' is lexically before '" << B << "'." << std::endl;
    } else if (A > B) {
        std::cout << "'" << A << "' is lexically after '" << B << "'." << std::endl;
    }

    int relationship = A.compare(B);
    std::cout << "The lexical relationship is: " << relationship << std::endl;

    int caseInsensitiveRelationship = A.compare(0, A.length(), B, 0, B.length(), true); // Custom compare function for case-insensitive comparison
    std::cout << "The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: " << caseInsensitiveRelationship << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    compare("Hello", "Hello");
    compare("5", "5.0"); // Note that numeric strings are compared lexicographically in C++
    compare("java", "Java");
    compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ");
    compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĵãvá");

    return 0;
}
```

In this C++ code, `std::transform` is used to convert strings to lower or upper case. For the `compare` function, we first compare strings as-is for exact equality and then compare them after converting to lower case for case-insensitive comparison. The `<` operator for string comparison in C++ performs a lexicographical comparison similar to `compareTo` in Java.

For handling numeric strings that should not be compared lexicographically but rather numerically, you would need to write additional logic to parse the strings as numbers before comparing them.
