 Certainly! Below is the Python code that performs the same operations as your C++ code, renaming files and directories within both the current working directory and the filesystem root:

```python
import os

# Rename file in the current working directory
os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")

# Rename directory in the current working directory
os.rename("docs", "mydocs")

# Rename file in the filesystem root
os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")

# Rename directory in the filesystem root
os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
```

This Python code uses the `os` module to perform the renaming operations, similar to how you would use `std::rename` in C++.
