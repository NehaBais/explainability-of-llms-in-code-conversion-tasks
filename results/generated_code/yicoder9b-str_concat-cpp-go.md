In Go language, the equivalent code would be:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    s := "hello"
    fmt.Println(s + " literal")
    s2 := s + " literal"
    fmt.Println(s2)
}
```
In the Go code, we're using `fmt` package to print strings on the console. The equivalent of '+' operator in C++ is used here for string concatenation.
