 Here's the equivalent Go code to create an empty file called "output.txt" and an empty directory called "docs":

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new empty file called "output.txt" in the current working directory
	file, err := os.Create("output.txt")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	file.Close()

	// Create an empty directory called "docs" in the current working directory
	err = os.Mkdir("docs", 0750)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

To run this code, you can save it to a file (e.g., `main.go`) and execute it with the Go compiler:


go run main.go


This will create an "output.txt" file and a "docs" directory in the current working directory. If you want to perform this operation in different directories, you can change the path accordingly.
