Here is your Java code converted to JavaScript:

```javascript
var s = "hello";
console.log(s + " literal");

var s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```

The `console.log` function in JavaScript is equivalent to `System.out.println` in Java, used for printing text or variables to the console. The rest of the code follows directly from your provided Java code.
