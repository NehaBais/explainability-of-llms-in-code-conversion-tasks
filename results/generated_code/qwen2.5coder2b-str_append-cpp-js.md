In JavaScript, you can use the `+` operator to append a string literal to another string. Here is your code converted to JavaScript:

```javascript
let greeting = "Hello" ;
greeting += ", world!" ;
console.log(greeting);
```

This script does exactly the same as your C++ code but uses JavaScript syntax.
