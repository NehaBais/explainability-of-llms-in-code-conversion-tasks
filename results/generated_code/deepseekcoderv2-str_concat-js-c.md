 To convert the given JavaScript code to C, you can use the `printf` function from the standard library to print strings. Here's how you can do it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Create a string variable equal to any text value
    char *s = "hello";
    
    // Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal
    char *result = (char *)malloc(strlen(s) + strlen(" there!") + 1);
    strcpy(result, s);
    strcat(result, " there!");
    
    // To illustrate the operation, show the content of the variables
    printf("%s\n", result);
    
    // Free allocated memory
    free(result);
    
    return 0;
}
```

This C code does the following:
1. Includes the standard input-output library (`stdio.h`) for using `printf`.
2. Defines a main function where the program execution starts.
3. Creates a string variable `s` initialized with "hello".
4. Allocates memory dynamically to store the concatenated result of `s` and " there!".
5. Uses `strcpy` to copy `s` into the allocated memory, then `strcat` to append " there!" to it.
6. Prints the content of the concatenated string using `printf`.
7. Frees the dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.
