Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your Rust code:

```JavaScript
let s = "World";
s = "Hello " + s;
console.log(s);
```
This code creates a string variable `s` with the value of "World", then replaces the value of `s` with another string literal "Hello " concatenated with original value of `s`. Finally it logs the result to console.
