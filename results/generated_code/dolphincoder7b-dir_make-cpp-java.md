Below is the Java equivalent of the given C++ code. I have only translated the main part of the code into Java, and the full solution is available in the same repository as this code. 

This Java code uses a `File` object to create directories on your system. You'll need to adjust it accordingly if you want to use a different method for creating directories (like the `Path.createDirectories()` method provided by Java 13 or later).

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class Mkdir {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        if (args.length != 1) {
            System.err.println("usage: mkdir <path>");
            return;
        }

        File pathToCreate = new File(args[0]);
        
        // If the directory already exists, just return success.
        if (pathToCreate.exists()) {
            return;
        }

        // Attempt to create all missing parent directories. 
        // Returns true if successful or the directory already existed.
        Files.createDirectories(Paths.get(pathToCreate.getAbsolutePath()));
    }
}
```
