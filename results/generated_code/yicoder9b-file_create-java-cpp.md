Below is the equivalent C++ code for creating a new file and an empty directory:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    try {
        std::ofstream("output.txt"); // Creates or truncates the file to 0 bytes in the current working directory
        std::ofstream(std::string(1, std::filesystem::path::preferred_separator) + "output.txt"); // Creates or truncates the file to 0 bytes at root
        std::filesystem::create_directory("docs");  // creates an empty directory called 'docs' in the current working directory
        std::filesystem::create_directory(std::string(1, std::filesystem::path::preferred_separator) + "docs" ); // creates an empty directory at root
    } 
    catch (const std::exception &e){
        std::cerr << e.what() << '\n';  // prints the error message if any exception is thrown while creating files or directories.
    }       
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that this code requires C++17 or later because `<filesystem>` library used in it was introduced in C++17. Also, you need to link against the `std, filesystem` library if your compiler doesn't do it automatically (some compilers like MinGW donâ€™t) by adding `-lstdc++fs` as a linker option.
