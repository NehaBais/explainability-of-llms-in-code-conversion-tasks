This is not directly possible to convert the Python code into Rust since Rust language doesn't have built-in file/directory operations and checking similar to `os` module's methods. However, you can achieve the same functionality using Rust's standard library. 

Here's a simple way to create and delete directories and files:
```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Create a directory named "docs"
    if let Err(e) = fs::create_dir("docs") {
        println!("Error creating dir: {}", e);
    }

    // Delete the newly created directory
    if let Err(e) = fs::remove_dir("docs") {
        println!("Error removing dir: {}", e);
    }

    // Create a file named "input.txt"
    if let Err(e) = fs::write("input.txt", b"Hello, world!") {
        println!("Error writing to file: {}", e);
    }
    
    // Delete the newly created file
    if let Err(e) = fs::remove_file("input.txt") {
        println!("Error removing file: {}", e);
    }

    // Check for a file named "input.txt" in the current working directory
    println!("{}", fs::metadata("input.txt").is_ok());

    // Check for a file named "/input.txt" in the filesystem root 
    println!("{}", fs::metadata("/input.txt").is_ok());
}
```
In this code, we use `fs` module to create and delete directories or files, as well as check their existence. 

Please note that Rust's standard library doesn't have a function similar to `os.path.isfile()`, you will need to use `fs::metadata()` and check the result for file existence. Similarly, there is no equivalent method in the standard library to check if a directory exists. However, `fs::read_dir()` can be used to list all the contents of a directory. 

If you want to specifically handle errors related to creation or deletion of directories and files, please use the `std::io` module for better error handling:

use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn main() {
    // Create a directory named "docs"
    match fs::create_dir("docs") {
        Ok(_) => println!("Directory created"),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error creating dir: {}", e),
    }

    // Delete the newly created directory
    match fs::remove_dir("docs") {
        Ok(_) => println!("Directory removed"),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error removing dir: {}", e),
    }

    // Create a file named "input.txt"
    match fs::write("input.txt", b"Hello, world!") {
        Ok(_) => println!("File written"),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error writing to file: {}", e),
    }
    
    // Delete the newly created file
    match fs::remove_file("input.txt") {
        Ok(_) => println!("File removed"),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error removing file: {}", e),
    }

    // Check for a file named "input.txt" in the current working directory
    let is_file = match fs::metadata("input.txt") {
        Ok(_) => true,
        Err(_) => false,
    };
    println!("{}", is_file);

    // Check for a file named "/input.txt" in the filesystem root 
    let is_file = match fs::metadata("/input.txt") {
        Ok(_) => true,
        Err(_) => false,
    };
    println!("{}", is_file);
}
