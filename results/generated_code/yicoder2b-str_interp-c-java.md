The equivalent Java code for the given C code would be:

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String extra = "little";
    System.out.println("Mary had a " + extra + " lamb.");
  }
}
```
This Java code does exactly the same thing as your C code. It prints out the string "Mary had a little lamb." when run. 

In Java, you don't need to explicitly declare the type of variables unlike in C. And you also don't need to include semicolons at the end of statements like in C. Also printf statement is replaced by System.out.println which is a standard java method to print out any kind of object to the console.
