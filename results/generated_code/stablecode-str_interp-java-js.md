In JavaScript, you can use template literals for string interpolation. Here is the equivalent code in JavaScript:

```javascript
let adjective = "little";
let lyric = `Mary had a ${adjective} lamb`;
```
This piece of code creates a string by interpolating another variable called 'adjective'. The result will be a string that says "Mary had a little lamb".
