The Java `File` class doesn't exist in JavaScript. But you can use Node.js's built-in `fs` module to achieve the same result.

Here is an equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Current working directory
if (fs.existsSync(path.join(process.cwd(), 'docs/input.txt'))) {
  console.log('The file exists in the current working directory.');
} else {
  console.log('The file does not exist in the current working directory.');
}

if (fs.existsSync(path.join(process.cwd(), 'docs'))) {
  console.log('The directory exists in the current working directory.');
} else {
  console.log('The directory does not exist in the current working directory.');
}

// Filesystem root
const root = path.resolve('/');
if (fs.existsSync(path.join(root, 'input.txt'))) {
  console.log('The file exists in the filesystem root.');
} else {
  console.log('The file does not exist in the filesystem root.');
}

if (fs.existsSync(path.join(root, 'docs'))) {
  console.log('The directory exists in the filesystem root.');
} else {
  console.log('The directory does not exist in the filesystem root.');
}
```

This script will check for the existence of `input.txt` and `docs` in both the current working directory and the filesystem root. It uses Node.js's built-in `fs.existsSync` function to check if a file or directory exists at a specified path.

Note: This assumes you're running this on a Unix-like system where `/` is the root directory, and it will not work as expected on Windows systems because of different folder structures. If you need to support Windows systems as well, please provide more information about the environments your code will be run in.
