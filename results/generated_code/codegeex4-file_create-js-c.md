C doesn't have built-in functions for file system operations such as creating new files and directories. However, you can use the standard POSIX function calls for these tasks.

In order to create a file, you should open it with O_CREAT flag in `open()` function call and write an empty string to it using `write()`. To create a directory, you should use `mkdir()`.

Here's the equivalent C code:

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void handle_error(int err) {
    if (err != 0)
        perror("Error");
}

int main() {
    // Create file in current directory
    int fd1 = open("./output.txt", O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
    close(fd1);

    // Create file in root directory
    int fd2 = open("/output.txt", O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
    close(fd2);

    // Create folder in current directory
    if (mkdir("./docs", 0755) != 0)
        handle_error(errno);

    // Create folder in root directory
    if (mkdir("/docs", 0755) != 0)
        handle_error(errno);

    return 0;
}
```

Please note that you need appropriate permissions to create files and directories in the filesystem root. This program also assumes that "here" means the current working directory and doesn't include a method for creating these items at the actual filesystem root, as that requires elevated privileges (e.g., running as root).
