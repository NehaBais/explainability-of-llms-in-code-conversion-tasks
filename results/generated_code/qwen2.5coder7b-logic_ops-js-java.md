Here is the Java version of your JavaScript code:

```java
public void logic(boolean a, boolean b) {
    System.out.println("a AND b: " + (a && b));
    System.out.println("a OR b: " + (a || b));
    System.out.println("NOT a: " + (!a));
}
```

This Java function works the same as your JavaScript code. It takes two boolean arguments, performs logical `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` operations on them and prints the results. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the output in the console.
