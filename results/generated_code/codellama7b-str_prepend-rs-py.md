You can use the following code in Python to achieve the same behavior as the Rust code:
```
s = "World"
s = "Hello " + s
print(s)
```
In this code, we first create a string variable `s` and assign it the value `"World"` using the `=` operator. Then, we prepend the string variable with another string literal `"Hello "` using the `+` operator, which creates a new string that is the concatenation of both strings. Finally, we print the modified string to the console using the `print()` function.
