In Rust, you can use the `std::fs` module to perform file operations such as creating a new empty file and directory. Please note that the filesystem root cannot be accessed directly in most operating systems because it requires administrative privileges.

Here's how to convert your Java code:

```rust
use std::io;
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    // Creating an empty file named "output.txt" in the current working directory
    let _ = create_empty_file("output.txt");
    // Creating an empty file named "output.txt" at filesystem root, this will fail because it needs admin privileges
    if let Err(e) = create_empty_file(&String::from("/") + "output.txt") {
        eprintln!("Error: {:?}", e);
    }

    // Creating an empty directory named "docs" in the current working directory
    let _ = fs::create_dir("docs").unwrap();
    // Creating an empty directory named "docs" at filesystem root, this will fail because it needs admin privileges
    if let Err(e) = fs::create_dir(&String::from("/") + "docs") {
        eprintln!("Error: {:?}", e);
    }
}

fn create_empty_file(path: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
    let file = Path::new(path);
    fs::File::create(&file)?;
    Ok(())
}
```
