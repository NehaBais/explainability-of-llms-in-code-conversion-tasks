The equivalent code in C++ using the standard filesystem library could be:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string err = "File move error";

    try {
        // Renaming files/directories in the current working directory
        std::filesystem::rename("input.txt", "output.txt"));
        std::filesystem::rename("docs", "mydocs");

        // Renaming files/directories in the root of filesystem
        std::filesystem::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt"));
        std::filesystem::rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
    }
    catch(std::exception &e) {
        std::cerr << "Exception: " << e.what() << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This C++ code does the same job as your Rust code. It uses the `<filesystem>` header from the standard library to manipulate file and directory paths, rename them, and move them if necessary.
Remember that this is a basic implementation and doesn't handle all possible exceptions or errors that may occur during file manipulation.
