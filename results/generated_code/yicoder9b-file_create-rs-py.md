Here is the Python equivalent of your Rust code.

Python does not have an exact equivalent to Rust's `unwrap_or_else` function in its standard library, so we use a try-except block instead:

```python
import os
import errno

def create(root):
    file_name = os.path.join(root, "output.txt")
    dir_name = os.path.join(root, "docs")

    try:
        os.mkdir(dir_name) 
        with open(file_name, 'w') as f:
            pass
    except OSError as e:
        # If the error was caused because the directory already existed, ignore it
        if e.errno == errno.EEXIST:
            pass
        else: 
          raise
          
try:
    create('.')  
    create('/')   
except Exception as e:      
    print("Error:", str(e))
```
In this Python code, the `os` module is used to interact with the file system and the directory structure. The `mkdir()` function is used to create a new directory, while the `open()` function is used to create an empty file. If any error occurs during these operations (like permission errors or trying to create a directory that already exists), it will be caught by the except block at the end and printed out.
