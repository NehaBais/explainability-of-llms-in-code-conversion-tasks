Sure! Here's the Rust equivalent of the code:
```rust
use std::fs;

fn rename_file(oldname: &str, newname: &str) -> bool {
    let oldpath = Path::new(&oldname);
    let newpath = Path::new(&newname);
    fs::rename(oldpath, newpath).is_ok()
}

fn test(type: &str, oldname: &str, newname: &str) {
    println!("The following {} called {} {} {}", type, oldname,
        rename_file(oldname, newname) ? "was renamed as" : "could not be renamed into", newname);
}

fn main() {
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
    test("directory", File::separator + "docs", "mydocs");
}
```
Note that Rust uses the `Path` type to represent file paths, and the `fs` module is used for file system operations like renaming files. The `test` function takes two string arguments, the old name of the file or directory, and its new name. It then calls the `rename_file` function with these arguments and prints a message indicating whether the rename was successful or not.
The `main` function simply calls the `test` function twice, once for a file called "input.txt" and once for a directory called "docs".
It's worth noting that Rust has a more concise way of writing this code using the `PathBuf` type:

use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

fn rename_file(oldname: &str, newname: &str) -> bool {
    let oldpath = Path::new(&oldname);
    let newpath = Path::new(&newname);
    fs::rename(oldpath, newpath).is_ok()
}

fn test(type: &str, oldname: &str, newname: &str) {
    println!("The following {} called {} {} {}", type, oldname,
        rename_file(oldname, newname) ? "was renamed as" : "could not be renamed into", newname);
}

fn main() {
    let input = PathBuf::from("input.txt");
    let output = PathBuf::from("output.txt");
    test("file", &input, &output);
    let docs = PathBuf::from("docs");
    let mydocs = PathBuf::from("mydocs");
    test("directory", &docs, &mydocs);
}

This code uses the `PathBuf` type to create a buffer that can hold a path and then passes references to it to the `test` function. This allows for more concise code and reduces the need for string manipulation.
