Sure, here's the Rust code that achieves this task:
```rust
use std::env;
use std::fs::{File, read_to_string, write};
fn main() {
 let input = "input.txt";
 let output = "output.txt";
 
 // Rename in current working directory
 rename(input, output).expect("Could not rename file");
 
 // Rename in root filesystem directory
 let root = env::current_dir().unwrap();
 let input = format!("{}{}", root.display(), input);
 let output = format!("{}{}", root.display(), output);
 rename(&input, &output).expect("Could not rename file");
 
 fn rename(old: &str, new: &str) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
 let content = read_to_string(old)?;
 write(new, &content)?;
 Ok(())
 }
}
```
This code uses the `std::fs` module to perform the file and directory operations. It first defines the paths of the input and output files as strings. Then it calls a function called `rename` that takes two parameters: the old filename and the new filename. This function reads the contents of the old file using `read_to_string`, writes the contents to the new file using `write`, and returns a result indicating whether the operation was successful or not.
The main function first calls `rename` twice, once in the current working directory and once in the root filesystem directory. It does this by creating full paths for both files using the `env::current_dir` and `format!` functions.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
