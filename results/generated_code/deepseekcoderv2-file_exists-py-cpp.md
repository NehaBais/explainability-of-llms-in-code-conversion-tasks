Answer: 
1. `os.path.isfile()` function checks if the given path is a regular file or not.
2. `os.path.isdir()` function checks if the given path is a directory or not.
3. We use `os.path` module to access file and directory related functions in Python.
4. Here, we check for the files input.txt and /input.txt in the current working directory and root respectively. Similarly, docs and /docs are checked for directories at current working directory and root respectively.
5. We use `os.path` module to access file and directory related functions in Python.
6. Here, we check if the input files exist or not by using os.path.isfile() function that returns true or false based on existence of a file in given path . Similarly , here we check for directories as well with respect to current working dir/root respectively.
7. We also used isdir method from same library mentioned above which will return 1 if it exists else zero.
8. In case where our program could not find either one then it prints an error message along with the appropriate flag depending upon whether or not we found any of them present in system as per requirement specified by questioner . Otherwise , no output is printed out onto console screen but instead just returns 1 if both conditions were met successfully or zero otherwise.
9. Finally after checking both cases conditionally using `if` clause statement followed by corresponding message being displayed on console window depending upon whether we found any such file/dir present inside system folder structure respectively .

To convert the Python code to C++, you need to use the C++ standard library functions from ```std``` namespace. Here is the conversion:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::cout << "File exists in current directory? " << (os.path.isfile("input.txt") ? "Yes" : "No") << '\n';
    std::cout << "File exists in root folder? " << (os.path.isfile("/input.txt") ? "Yes" : "No") << '\n';
    std::cout << "Directory exists in current directory? " << (os.path.isdir("docs") ? "Yes" : "No") << '\n';
    std::cout << "Directory exists in root folder? " << (os.path.isdir("/docs") ? "Yes" : "No") << '\n';
}
```
