Sure! Here's the JavaScript code that performs the same operations as the Golang code:
```javascript
let text = "hello";
console.log(text);
console.log(text + " literal");
let output = text + " literal";
console.log(output);
```
This code creates a string variable called `text` and assigns it the value of "hello". It then outputs the value of `text` to the console using `console.log()`. 
Next, it concatenates the value of `text` with the string literal "literal" and assigns the result to another string variable called `output`. Finally, it outputs the value of `output` to the console using `console.log()`.
