The Go standard library does not provide a direct method for renaming files/directories, but it can be accomplished using the os package as shown in this code. Also note that you cannot rename files/directories outside of your current working directory (or filesystem root) in Golang like C++ std::rename function.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func Rename(oldpath, newpath string) {
    if err := os.Rename(oldpath, newpath); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
}

func main() {
    // Current working directory rename
    Rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
    Rename("docs", "mydocs")
    
    // File system root path - Not supported in Golang by design 
    /*Rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
    Rename("/docs", "/mydocs")*/
}
```
The rename function requires two string arguments: the oldpath of the file/directory to be renamed and the newpath to which it should be renamed. It returns an error if any occurred during the operation, which is then printed to stdout. 

Remember that in Golang, you can't rename files or directories outside of the current working directory as per design. If you try to do so, os.Rename will return a "permission denied" error.
