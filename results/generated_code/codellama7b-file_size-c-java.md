To convert the given C code to Java, you can use the following conversion:
```
import java.io.*;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        String inputFile = "input.txt";
        File file = new File(inputFile);
        long size = Files.size(file.toPath());
        System.out.println("Size of " + inputFile + ": " + size);
        
        String rootInputFile = "/input.txt";
        File rootFile = new File(rootInputFile);
        size = Files.size(rootFile.toPath());
        System.out.println("Size of " + rootInputFile + ": " + size);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

1. The `stat` function is used in C to get information about a file, such as its size. In Java, you can use the `Files.size` method to get the size of a file.
2. To get the size of a file in the current working directory, you can create a `File` object and pass it to the `Files.size` method.
3. To get the size of a file in the file system root, you can use the same approach but with the path starting with `/`.
4. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the console in Java, and the `System.out.println` method is used to print output to the console.
5. In C, the `printf` function is used to format and print output to the console. In Java, you can use the `System.out.println` method with a string template to achieve similar functionality.
