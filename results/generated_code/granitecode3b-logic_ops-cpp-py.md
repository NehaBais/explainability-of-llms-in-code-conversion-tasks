Here's the Python code that achieves the same functionality:
```
def print_logic(a, b):
 print("a and b is", a and b)
 print("a or b is", a or b)
 print("not a is", not a)
```
This code uses the `and`, `or`, and `not` operators in Python to achieve the same functionality as the C++ code. The `std::boolalpha` flag is not needed in Python, so it is omitted from the code.
