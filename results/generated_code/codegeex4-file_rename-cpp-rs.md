Rust's standard library does not provide a built-in method for renaming file or directories across filesystems. However, you can use the nix crate which provides bindings to POSIX system calls.

First, add nix to your Cargo.toml:

[dependencies]
nix = "0.22"

Then, convert the code as follows:

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use nix::unistd::{rename};
use nix::NixPath;

fn main() {
    rename(Path::new("input.txt"), Path::new("output.txt")).expect("Could not rename file");
    rename(Path::new("docs"), Path::new("mydocs")).expect("Could not rename directory");

    let root = Path::new("/");
    rename(root.join("input.txt").as_nix(), root.join("output.txt").as_nix()).expect("Could not rename file in the root");
    rename(root.join("docs").as_nix(), root.join("mydocs").as_nix()).expect("Could not rename directory in the root");

}
```

Please note that on Unix-like systems, the user needs to have appropriate permissions to operate on files or directories under the root. For example, a non-root user may lack necessary permissions to perform operations on files or directories under `/`.

Also, please note that this code will panic if renaming operation fails. You might want to add error handling depending on your requirements.

You can convert `Path::new()` into `AsNix` using `.as_nix()`. This allows you to use nix functions with `std::path::Path` objects.
