Sure! Here's the Java code that performs the same operations as the Golang code:
```java
package main;
 
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class BitwiseOperations {
 
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
 System.out.print("Enter first integer: ");
 int a = scanner.nextInt();
 System.out.print("Enter second integer: ");
 int b = scanner.nextInt();
 bitwiseOperations(a, b);
 }
 
 public static void bitwiseOperations(int a, int b) {
 System.out.println("a:   " + Integer.toBINARYString(a));
 System.out.println("b:   " + Integer.toBINARYString(b));
 
 // Bitwise logical operations
 int and = a & b;
 int or = a | b;
 int xor = a ^ b;
 int not = ~a;
 System.out.println("and: " + Integer.toBINARYString(and));
 System.out.println("or:  " + Integer.toBINARYString(or));
 System.out.println("xor: " + Integer.toBINARYString(xor));
 System.out.println("not: " + Integer.toBINARYString(not));
 
 if (b < 0) {
 System.err.println("Right operand is negative, but all shifts require an unsigned right operand (shift distance).");
 return;
 }
 int ua = a & 0xFFFF;
 int ub = b & 0x1F;
 
 // Logical shifts (unsigned left operand)
 int shl = ua << ub;
 int shr = ua >> ub;
 System.out.println("shl: " + Integer.toBINARYString(shl));
 System.out.println("shr: " + Integer.toBINARYString(shr));
 
 // Arithmetic shifts (signed left operand)
 int las = a << ub;
 int ras = a >> ub;
 System.out.println("las: " + Integer.toBINARYString(las));
 System.out.println("ras: " + Integer.toBINARYString(ras));
 
 // Rotations
 int rol = (ua << ub) | (ua >>> (16 - ub));
 int ror = (ua >>> ub) | (ua << (16 - ub));
 System.out.println("rol: " + Integer.toBINARYString(rol));
 System.out.println("ror: " + Integer.toBINARYString(ror));
 }
}
```
In this Java code, we first take the input from the user and store it in variables `a` and `b`. We then call the `bitwiseOperations` method, which performs the same operations as the Golang code.
The `bitwiseOperations` method uses the `Integer.toBINARYString` method to convert the integers to binary strings and print them using `System.out.println`. It also performs the bitwise logical operations, shifts, and rotations on the integers.
To perform arithmetic shifts, we first convert `a` to an unsigned integer by taking its modulo with `0xFFFF` (65535) and then performing the shift operation. We use the same method for right arithmetic shifts as well.
The rotations are performed using bitwise operations as well, where we first perform a logical left rotation by shifting `a` to the left by `ub` bits and then performing an OR operation with a shifted version of `a`. We do the same for right rotations.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
