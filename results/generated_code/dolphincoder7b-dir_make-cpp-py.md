This is the Python equivalent of the C++ code provided above, which will create a directory and any missing parents in Python. This task involves using the os module to work with file paths and directories, as well as the pathlib module for creating a Path object from a path string.

The 'os' module in Python provides functions for working with files and directories, while 'pathlib' can create a Path object that represents a file or directory and handles missing parents.

Here is the Python code:
```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

def mkdir(path):
    # Check if the path exists
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        # Create any missing directories
        return Path(path).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# Example usage
path = './path/to/dir'
mkdir(path)
```
Note: The "os" and "pathlib" modules are imported into the namespace, so they need to be used with the respective module prefix (e.g., os.path instead of path.path). Also, in Python, 'create_directories' method is replaced by 'mkdir'.
