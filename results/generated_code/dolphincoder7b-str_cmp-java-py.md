        if A >= B:
            print(f"'{A}' is not lexically before '{B}'.")
        if A <= B:
            print(f"'{A}' is not lexically after '{B}'.")

```
Note that the string comparison methods in Python are not case sensitive and there's no separate method for comparing two strings while considering case insensitivity. The only way to do it is by converting both strings to lowercase or uppercase before comparing them. The `compareTo` method has been replaced with a more general `__cmp__` method in Python, which is used for string comparisons. For case-insensitive comparison, you can use the `lower()` method for strings which converts them into lower-case letters before performing the comparison.
