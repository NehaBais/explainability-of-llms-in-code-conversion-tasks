 Here is the equivalent code in Python:
```
greeting = "Hello"
greeting += ", world!"
print(greeting)
```
Explanation:

In C++, `std::string` is used to store strings, and the `.append()` method is used to append a string literal to the end of the existing string. In Python, the `+=` operator is used to concatenate two strings together. The `print()` function is also used to display the resulting string on the console.

Note that in C++, `std::cout` is used to print the contents of a string to the console, while in Python, the `print()` function is used instead.
