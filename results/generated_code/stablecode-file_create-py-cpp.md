In C++, the equivalent operations to create a file and a directory would need to be performed using standard library functions, such as `std::ofstream`, `std::filesystem::create_directories()`, and `std::filesystem::remove()` (for removing directories).
Here is an attempt at this in C++:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <filesystem>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
void create(const std::string& directory) {
    // Create file "output.txt" in the specified directory
    std::ofstream output_file{fs::path{directory}/"output.txt"}};

    // The above line creates an empty file with size 0 bytes at the path "<directory>/output.txt". 

    // Here we close the ofstream object to 
    // automatically complete any remaining 
    // write operation and to close the output stream.
    output_file.close();

    // Create directory "docs" in the specified directory
    fs::create_directories(fs::path{directory}/"docs"));
}
int main() {
    create("."); // current directory
    create("/"); // root directory
    return 0;
}
```
This code will create an empty file "output.txt" at the path "<directory>/output.txt" and an empty directory "docs" at the path "<directory>/docs". The function `create` takes a string argument `directory`, which is the path to the directory where the file and directory should be created.
Note that this code requires C++17 or later, as it uses some features of the language that were not available in earlier versions of the language.
