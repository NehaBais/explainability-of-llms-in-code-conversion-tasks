This problem involves a basic comparison between two integers, and displaying a message accordingly. The code provided in Java can be translated into C++ quite easily, with the following adaptations:

1. Import statements - In C++, there are no equivalents of `java.io.*` and `Integer`. So, instead of importing these classes, we will use standard input/output (`iostream`) functions like `cin` and `cout`, as well as an `int` type.
2. Class declaration - Java uses the `public static void main()` method to define a program's entry point. In C++, there is no equivalent for this, so we can simply use `main()`.
3. Initialization of objects - No need to initialize BufferedReader in C++. We will directly read from `std::cin` using `>>`.
4. Method declaration and invocation - Java uses `BufferedReader` as a class name, whereas C++ only understands lowercase identifiers. In Java, we use the fully qualified name `java.io.BufferedReader`, but C++ does not require it because `iostream` is already included. As for calling the `main()` function, we will write `return 0;` instead.
5. Statement formatting - The original code uses a combination of tabs and spaces to format its statements. In C++, we can use whitespace or braces to separate different parts of a statement. Here's how to format the code:
```cpp
int main() {
    int nbr1, nbr2; // Declare variables
    std::cin >> nbr1 >> nbr2; // Read input

    if (nbr1 < nbr2)
        std::cout << nbr1 << " is less than " << nbr2 << "\n";

    if (nbr1 > nbr2)
        std::cout << nbr1 << " is greater than " << nbr2 << "\n";

    if (nbr1 == nbr2)
        std::cout << nbr1 << " is equal to " << nbr2 << "\n";

    return 0; // Exit successfully
}
```
6. Exception handling - C++ doesn't have exceptions, so we don't need to handle any `IOException` or other exceptions in this code.

In summary, the given Java code can be translated into C++, with only a few adjustments to syntax and formatting.
