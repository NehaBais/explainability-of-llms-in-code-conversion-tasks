Here is the code in C++:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <experimental/filesystem>

using namespace std;
namespace fs = experimental::filesystem;

int main() {
    string errorMsg = "File move error";
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt", errorMsg); // current working directory
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs", errorMsg);
    fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt", errorMsg); // filesystem root
    fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs", errorMsg);
}
```
Note that the `fs` namespace is a part of C++17's experimental file system library, which provides a way to interact with the file system in a more convenient way. In this code, we are using the `fs::rename()` function to rename files and directories. We are also using the `std::string` class to store the error message and the `std::vector` class to store the files and directories to be renamed.

It's important to note that the file names in the `fs::rename()` function must be specified as absolute paths, starting with a forward slash (`/`), or relative to the current working directory. In this code, we are using absolute paths for both the input and output files and directories.
