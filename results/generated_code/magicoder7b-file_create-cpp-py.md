 The equivalent code in Python would be:

```python
import os

# Create a new empty file called "output.txt" and an empty directory called "docs".
# Once here, i.e. in the current working directory.
os.mknod('output.txt')   # This creates a new file with no content.
os.mkdir('docs')         # This creates a new directory.

# Do the same for the filesystem root (/).
os.chroot('/')          # Changes to the root directory.
os.mknod('/output.txt')  # This creates a new file with no content in the root directory.
os.mkdir('/docs')        # This creates a new directory in the root directory.
```
Please note that `os.chroot()` is not available on all platforms and might raise an `OSError` when trying to use it. You need to run your code as root or have proper permission to change the current working directory to the root. Also, `mknod()` is usually used with character devices like `/dev/null`, but here I've just used it for creating a plain file.
