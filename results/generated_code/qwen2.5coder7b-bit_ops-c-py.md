Sure! Here is the Python version of your C code:

```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    print(f"a and b: {a & b}")
    print(f"a or b: {a | b}")
    print(f"a xor b: {a ^ b}")
    print(f"not a: {~a}")
    print(f"a << n: {a << b}")  # left shift
    print(f"a >> n: {a >> b}")  # on most platforms: arithmetic right shift
    c = a  # convert the signed integer into unsigned, so it will perform logical shift
    print(f"c >> b: {c >> b}")  # logical right shift
    
    # there are no rotation operators in Python, but we can simulate them using bitwise operations
    def left_rotate(n, d):
        return (n << d) | (n >> (32 - d)) if d <= 31 else n
    
    def right_rotate(n, d):
        return (n >> d) | (n << (32 - d)) if d <= 31 else n
    
    print(f"a left rotate by {b}: {left_rotate(a, b)}")
    print(f"a right rotate by {b}: {right_rotate(a, b)}")

# Example usage:
bitwise(5, 2)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: Performs a bitwise AND operation between `a` and `b`.
2. **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: Performs a bitwise OR operation between `a` and `b`.
3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: Performs a bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `b`.
4. **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**: Performs a bitwise NOT operation on `a`.
5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts the bits of `a` to the left by `b` positions.
6. **Arithmetic Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts the bits of `a` to the right by `b` positions (preserving the sign).
7. **Logical Right Shift**: This is achieved by first converting `a` to an unsigned integer and then performing a logical right shift.

### Note:
- For left and right rotates, Python does not have built-in operators like C does for rotate operations (`<<=` and `>>=`). Therefore, we simulate these operations using bitwise shifts.
  
  - The `left_rotate` function performs a rotation by shifting the bits to the left by `d` positions and wrapping around the shifted-out bits from the right side.
  
  - The `right_rotate` function performs a rotation by shifting the bits to the right by `d` positions and wrapping around the shifted-out bits from the left side.

This code should work as expected for integers within the range that Python can handle.
