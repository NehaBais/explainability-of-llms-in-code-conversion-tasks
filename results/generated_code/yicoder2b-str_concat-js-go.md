Sure, here's how you can convert that JavaScript code into Golang:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    s := "hello" 
    fmt.Println(s + " there!")
}
```
This Go code does the same thing as your original JavaScript code - it declares a variable `s` and assigns it the string value "hello". It then prints out the concatenated string "hello there!".
