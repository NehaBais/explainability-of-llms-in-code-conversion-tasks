Here's the Rust code that computes the factors of a positive integer:
```
use std::cmp::max;
fn isqrt(n: u64) -> u64 {
 let mut r = 1;
 while r*r < n {
 r += 1;
 }
 r
}
fn factor(n: u64) -> Vec<u64> {
 if n == 0 {
 return vec![];
 } else if n == 1 {
 return vec![1];
 }
 let mut factors = Vec::new();
 for x in (1..=isqrt(n)).rev() {
 if n % x == 0 {
 factors.push(x);
 factors.extend(factor(n / x));
 break;
 }
 }
 factors
}
fn main() {
 let test_cases = vec![45, 53, 64];
 for &i in &test_cases {
 println!("{}: factors: {:?}", i, factor(i));
 }
}
```
The `isqrt` function is a helper function that returns the square root of a number rounded down to the nearest integer. The `factor` function takes a positive integer as input and returns a vector of its factors. It uses a for loop to iterate over all possible factor values, starting from the largest factor (the square root of the input) and working towards 1. If a factor is found, it adds it to the list of factors and recursively calls `factor` on the quotient of the input and the factor to get the remaining factors. When no more factors are found, the function returns the final list of factors.
The `main` function creates a vector of test cases and iterates over them, printing out the result of calling the `factor` function on each one.
