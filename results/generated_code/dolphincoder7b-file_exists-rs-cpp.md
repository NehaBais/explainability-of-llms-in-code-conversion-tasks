The Rust code uses the `std::fs` module for performing file I/O operations. However, C++ doesn't have a similar library, and instead relies on the POSIX functions provided by `<cstdio>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<unistd.h>`, `<fcntl.h>`, and other libraries to interact with the filesystem.

Here's an equivalent C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int main() {
    for (const auto& file : {"input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", "/docs"}) {
        struct stat attr;
        if (stat(file, &attr) == 0) {
            if (S_ISDIR(attr.st_mode)) {
                std::cout << file << " is a directory\n";
            } else {
                std::cout << file << " is a file\n";
            }
        } else {
            std::cerr << file << " does not exist\n";
        }
    }
}
```

Note that C++ doesn't have an equivalent for Rust's `Ok(attr)` and `Err(_)`. Instead, we use the standard library function `stat` to get the attributes of a file or directory. If it exists, we check if it is a directory by checking the bits in `st_mode`.

This is a very basic example. For more robust error handling and better file I/O operations, you should consider using the C++ standard library's `<filesystem>` header.
