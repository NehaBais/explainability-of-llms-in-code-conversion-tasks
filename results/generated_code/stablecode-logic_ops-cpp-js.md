Here's your C++ code converted to JavaScript:

JavaScript:
```javascript
function printLogic(a, b) {
    console.log("a and b is " + (a && b)));
    console.log("a or b is " + (a || b))));
    console.log("not a is " + (!a))));
}
```
This JavaScript function takes two boolean values (`a` and `b`) as arguments, then prints the results of logical operations ("and", "or", and "not") on both arguments.
