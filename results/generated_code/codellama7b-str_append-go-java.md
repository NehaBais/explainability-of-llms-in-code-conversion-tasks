Here's the equivalent code in Java:
```java
package main;
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder("foo");
        s.append("bar");
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* In Golang, the `strings` package is used to work with strings. In Java, we use the `StringBuilder` class to create a string builder object and append text to it.
* The `WriteString()` method in Golang is equivalent to the `append()` method in Java. It appends the specified string to the end of the current string builder.
* In both languages, the `fmt.Print()` function is used to print the contents of the string builder to the console. In Java, this function is called `System.out.println()`.
* The `String()` method in Golang returns the concatenated string value of the string builder, which is then printed to the console using `fmt.Print()`. In Java, we simply use the `toString()` method to get the resulting string and print it using `System.out.println()`.
