 Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
import os

def rename_file(oldname, newname):
    try:
        os.rename(oldname, newname)
        return True
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return False

def test(type_, oldname, newname):
    print("The following {} called {} was renamed as {}.".format(
        type_, oldname, newname if rename_file(oldname, newname) else "could not be renamed into"
    ))

# Test in the current working directory
test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt")
test("file", os.path.join("/", "input.txt"), os.path.join("/", "output.txt"))
test("directory", "docs", "mydocs")
test("directory", os.path.join("/", "docs"), os.path.join("/", "mydocs"))
```

This Python code performs the same operations as the Java code: it renames a file and a directory in both the current working directory and the filesystem root, handling both files and directories correctly.
