 To convert the given C code to Python, we will use the `os` and `os.path` modules to create a file and directory. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import os

def main():
    # Create an empty file named "output.txt" in the current working directory
    with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
        pass  # This will create an empty file of size 0 bytes

    # Create an empty directory named "docs" in the current working directory
    os.mkdir("docs")

    # Optionally, you can set permissions for the created files and directories
    # However, Python does not provide a direct way to set POSIX file permissions like C's umask
    # The following lines are commented out because setting permissions in Python is more complex than in C
    # os.chmod("output.txt", 0o640)  # This would be equivalent to chmod 640 output.txt in Unix-like systems
    # os.chmod("docs", 0o750)        # This would be equivalent to chmod 750 docs in Unix-like systems

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python script does the following:
1. Opens or creates a file named "output.txt" in write mode, which automatically truncates it if it already exists, and closes it immediately.
2. Creates an empty directory named "docs" in the current working directory.
3. Comments out lines that attempt to set POSIX file permissions for the created files and directories, as Python does not directly support setting these permissions due to security restrictions. In a Unix-like environment, you would use `os.chmod` with appropriate mode values, but this is not straightforward in standard Python without additional libraries or platform-specific code.
