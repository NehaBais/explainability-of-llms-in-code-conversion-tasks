The provided code is written in Rust. It verifies whether there are certain files and directories in the current working directory and filesystem root. To convert it to JavaScript, you would need to use Node.js, which provides a file system API similar to that of Rust.

Here's how the equivalent JavaScript version could look like:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

function checkFileAndDir(filepath) {
    try {
        let stats = fs.lstatSync(filepath);
        if (stats.isDirectory()) {
            console.log(`${filepath} is a directory`);
        } else {
            console.log(`${filepath} is a file`);
        }
    } catch (err) {
        if (err.code === 'ENOENT') {
            console.log(`${filepath} does not exist`);
        } else {
            throw err;
        }
    }
}

checkFileAndDir('input.txt'); // For the current directory
checkFileAndDir('/input.txt');  // For the root filesystem
```
Remember to run this script in a Node.js environment, because JavaScript does not have native support for file system operations like Rust.
