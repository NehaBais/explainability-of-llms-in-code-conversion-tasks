Here's the converted code from Golang to C++ that satisfies the requirement:
```
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
 string s = ""; // create a string variable equal to any text value
 s += "foo"; // append another string literal to the variable in an idiomatic way
 cout << s; // show the contents of the variable after the append operation
 return 0;
}
```
Note that in C++, we use `""` instead of `''` for string literals, and we don't need to import the `strings` package because we're using the `string` class from the standard library. We also don't need to call `s.String()` explicitly, as the `string` class has an implicit conversion operator to `const char*` that can be printed directly with `cout`.
