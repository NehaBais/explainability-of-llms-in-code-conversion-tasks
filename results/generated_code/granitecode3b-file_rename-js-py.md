Here's the Python code that accomplishes the task you described:
```python
import shutil
# Move the file in the current working directory
shutil.move('input.txt', 'output.txt')
# Move the file to the filesystem root
shutil.move('/input.txt', '/output.txt')
# Move the directory in the current working directory
shutil.move('docs', 'mydocs')
# Move the directory to the filesystem root
shutil.move('/docs', '/mydocs')
```
Note that you'll need to have the `shutil` module installed for this code to work. You can install it using pip:
`pip install shutil`
