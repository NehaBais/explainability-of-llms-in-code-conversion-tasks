Here's the equivalent Python code:
```
s = "Hello, world!"
```
In Python, you can concatenate strings using the `+` operator or the `format()` method. In this case, we're concatenating two string literals using the `+` operator. However, since the requirement only asks for a text value, we can simply assign it to the string variable without any additional formatting.
