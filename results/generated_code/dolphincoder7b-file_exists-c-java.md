This code uses the `sys/types.h` and `sys/stat.h` libraries to perform operations on files and directories, including checking for regular files (with `S_ISREG`) and directories (with `S_ISDIR`). The `main()` function first checks for the existence of a file called "input.txt" in the current working directory and then another one called "docs". It then performs the same check with both file and directory paths, including checking the filesystem root ("/").
Here is the converted Java code:
```java
import java.io.File;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File input = new File("input.txt");
        System.out.println("input.txt is a regular file? " + (input.exists() && input.isFile()));
        File docs = new File("docs");
        System.out.println("docs is a directory? " + docs.exists() && docs.isDirectory());

        File fsInput = new File("/input.txt");
        System.out.println("/input.txt is a regular file? " + (fsInput.exists() && fsInput.isFile()));
        File fsDocs = new File("/docs");
        System.out.println("/docs is a directory? " + fsDocs.exists() && fsDocs.isDirectory());
    }
}
```
