The following code can be used to verify the size of a file called 'input.txt' in both the current working directory and the root of the file system:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
    // Opening and checking the size of the file in the current working directory
    ifstream input("input.txt");
    cout << "Size of input.txt in the current working directory: ";
    cout << input.tellg() << " bytes\n";
 
    // Opening and checking the size of the file in the root of the file system
    ifstream input2("/input.txt");
    cout << "Size of input.txt in the root of the file system: ";
    cout << input2.tellg() << " bytes\n";
    return 0;
}
```
