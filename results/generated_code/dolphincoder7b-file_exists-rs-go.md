The equivalent code in Golang would be:
```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    for _, file := range []string{"input.txt", "docs", "/", "input.txt", "/docs"}  {
        if file == "/" || file == "" {
            continue
        }
        info, err := os.Stat(file)
        if err != nil && os.IsNotExist(err) {
            fmt.Printf("%s does not exist\n", file)
        } else if info.IsDir() {
            fmt.Printf("%s is a directory\n", file)
        } else {
            fmt.Printf("%s is a file\n", file)
        }
    }
}
```
This code first imports the necessary packages (fmt and os), then iterates through the specified files, checking whether they exist in each iteration using os.Stat and checking if the resultant FileInfo contains a directory by checking IsDir. If they don't exist or are not directories, it prints out an appropriate error message.
Note that the "input.txt" file would be created on Windows-based systems due to the way Go handles paths, so there isn't a corresponding Rust code snippet for that part of the requirement.
