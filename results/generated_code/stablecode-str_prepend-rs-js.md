Here is the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
let s = "World";
s = "Hello " + s;
console.log(s);
```
This JavaScript code does the same thing as the Rust code you provided: it creates a string variable `s` with the value "World", prepends this variable with the string literal "Hello ", and then logs this final string to the console.
