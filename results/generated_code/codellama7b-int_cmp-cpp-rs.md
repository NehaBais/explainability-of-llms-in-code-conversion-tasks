```
use std::io;

fn main() {
	let mut a = String::new();
	let mut b = String::new();

	if !(io::stdin().read_line(&mut a).is_ok() && io::stdin().read_line(&mut b).is_ok()) {
		println!("could not read the numbers");
		return;
	}

	let a: i32 = a.trim().parse().expect("failed to parse number");
	let b: i32 = b.trim().parse().expect("failed to parse number");

	// test for less-than
	if a < b {
		println!("{} is less than {}", a, b);
	}

	// test for equality
	if a == b {
		println!("{} is equal to {}", a, b);
	}

	// test for greater-than
	if a > b {
		println!("{} is greater than {}", a, b);
	}
}
```
Here's the explanation of changes:

1. The `cin` function has been replaced with `io::stdin().read_line()`. This is because `cin` is a C++ feature and Rust uses its own input/output system.
2. The `!` operator has been removed, as it is not needed in Rust.
3. The `trim()` method has been added to remove any whitespace from the input strings before attempting to parse them as integers. This is because Rust's `parse()` function assumes that there are no leading or trailing whitespace characters.
4. The `expect` method has been used to handle errors when parsing the integers. This method allows you to specify a custom error message to be displayed if the input cannot be parsed.
5. The conditionals have been replaced with `if` statements, which is the typical way to perform conditional logic in Rust.
