In C language, logical operations are performed using the keywords "&&" (and), "||" (or), and "!" (not). The code will look as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void logic(int a, int b) {
    printf("a && b: %d\n", a && b);  // 0 means false in C, any non-zero value is true
    printf("a || b: %d\n", a || b);  // 0 means false, anything else (except zero) is true
    printf("!a: %d\n", !a);          // 1 means true, 0 means false
}
```
In this C code function logic, you pass two integer parameters. In the "logic" function, we print the results of performing AND, OR, and NOT on those arguments (in that order). This is just a reinterpretation of your Python example in C language syntax; it does not translate to an entirely different program or conceptual idea in C language.
