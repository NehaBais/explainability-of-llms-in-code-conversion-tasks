Here's the equivalent C++ code using `std::string`:
```
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 std::string adjective = "little";
 std::string lyric = "Mary had a " + adjective + " lamb";
 std::cout << lyric << std::endl;
 return 0;
}
```
In this C++ code, we first define the `adjective` variable as a string with the value `"little"`. Then, we use the `+` operator to concatenate the `adjective` variable with the rest of the `lyric` string. Finally, we output the resulting `lyric` string using `std::cout`.
