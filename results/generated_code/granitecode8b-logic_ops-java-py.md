Here's the Python code that achieves the same functionality as the given Java code:
```
def logic(a, b):
 print("a AND b: ", a and b)
 print("a OR b: ", a or b)
 print("NOT a: ", not a)
```
In this Python code, we define a function called `logic` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`, which are both boolean values. We then use the logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` to perform the desired operations on these arguments and print the results using the `print` function.
