C does not have a built-in file system object like JavaScript, instead, you can use the standard C libraries such as `<unistd.h>` and `<dirent.h>`. Here is an example of how to perform the same task:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int main() {
    struct stat st;

    if (stat("input.txt", &st) == 0 && S_ISREG(st.st_mode)) {
        printf("'input.txt' exists and is a file.\n");
    } else if (stat("c:/input.txt", &st) == 0 && S_ISREG(st.st_mode)) {
        printf("'c:/input.txt' exists and is a file.\n");
    } else {
        printf("'input.txt' or 'c:/input.txt' does not exist as a regular file.\n");
    }

    if (stat("docs", &st) == 0 && S_ISDIR(st.st_mode)) {
        printf("'docs' exists and is a directory.\n");
    } else if (stat("c:/docs", &st) == 0 && S_ISDIR(st.st_mode)) {
        printf("'c:/docs' exists and is a directory.\n");
    } else {
        printf("'docs' or 'c:/docs' does not exist as a directory.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Note that C has different function names for the same tasks (e.g., `stat()` instead of `FileExists()`, and `strcmp()` instead of `localeCompare()`). Also, in C you have to check if a file or directory exists with an error-checking mechanism (`if(stat("input.txt", &st) == 0`) and then determine whether it's a regular file or a directory (`S_ISREG()` for regular files and `S_ISDIR()` for directories).
