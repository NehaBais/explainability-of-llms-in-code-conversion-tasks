Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task as the Java code:
```python
import os
def rename_file(oldname, newname):
 try:
 os.rename(oldname, newname)
 return True
 except FileNotFoundError:
 print(f"File or directory {oldname} not found.")
 return False
def test_rename(type, oldname, newname):
 if rename_file(oldname, newname):
 print(f"The following {type} called {oldname} was renamed as {newname}.")
 else:
 print(f"The following {type} called {oldname} could not be renamed into {newname}.")
test_rename("file", "input.txt", "output.txt")
test_rename("file", "/", "/output.txt")
test_rename("directory", "docs", "mydocs")
test_rename("directory", "/", "/mydocs")
```
The Python code uses the `os` module to rename files and directories. The `rename_file()` function takes an old name and a new name as arguments and attempts to rename them using `os.rename()`. If the file or directory does not exist, it prints an error message and returns False.
The `test_rename()` function tests the `rename_file()` function with different inputs. It calls `rename_file()` with the old name and new name arguments and prints a message indicating whether the rename was successful or not.
