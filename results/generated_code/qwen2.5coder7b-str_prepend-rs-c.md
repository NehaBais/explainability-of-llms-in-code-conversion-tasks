In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters. The concept of immutable strings is not directly available in C as it is in Rust (with the `String` type). However, you can simulate immutability by using constant character arrays.

Here's how you can achieve the same functionality as the given Rust code snippet in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    // Create a string variable with any text value
    const char *s = "World";

    // Prepend the string variable with another string literal
    char *result = (char *)malloc(12 * sizeof(char)); // Allocate enough space for "Hello World\0"
    snprintf(result, 12, "Hello %s", s);

    // Print the resulting string
    printf("%s\n", result);

    // Free the allocated memory
    free(result);

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Create a String Variable**: We declare a constant character pointer `s` and initialize it with the string "World".
2. **Prepend Another String Literal**: We allocate enough memory for the new string "Hello World" using `malloc`. The size is 12 because "Hello World\0" requires 12 characters.
3. **Format the String**: We use `snprintf` to format the new string by concatenating "Hello " and the original string `s`.
4. **Print the Resulting String**: We print the resulting string using `printf`.
5. **Free Allocated Memory**: We free the allocated memory using `free` to avoid memory leaks.

This code will output:

Hello World
