In C++, the `rename()` function is not limited to rename files and directories in the same directory or root. If you want to move a file or directory from one location to another in C++, you would need to use other functions like `move()`. Here is an example of how this can be done:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <filesystem>

int main() 
{
    std::filesystem::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    std::filesystem::rename("docs", "mydocs");
    std::filesystem::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    std::filesystem::rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
    return 0;
}
```

Keep in mind that this code requires C++17 or higher to compile as `std::filesystem` is a part of the Standard Template Library (STL) introduced in C++17. If you are using an older compiler, you may need to use different methods to rename files and directories in C++.
