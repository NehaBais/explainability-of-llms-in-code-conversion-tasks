Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given Python code:
```javascript
const extra = 'little';
const newStr = `Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`;
console.log(newStr);
```
In this JavaScript code, we first declare a constant variable `extra` with the value `'little'`. Then, we use backticks (`` ` ``) to create a template string that contains the original string and a placeholder for the value of `extra`. The placeholder is denoted by `${}` and will be replaced by the value of `extra` when the template string is evaluated. Finally, we log the resulting string to the console using `console.log()`.
