Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task:
```
import os
file_size = os.path.getsize('input.txt')
root_file_size = os.path.getsize('/input.txt')
```
This code uses the `os` module to get the size of the file in bytes. The `getsize()` method takes a path as an argument and returns the size of the file. The first call to `getsize()` gets the size of the file in the current working directory, while the second call gets the size of the file in the file system root.
