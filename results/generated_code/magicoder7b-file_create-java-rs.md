 In Rust, you can use the `std::fs::File` and `std::fs::create_dir` methods to accomplish this task. Here is your Java code converted into Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    fs::File::create("output.txt")?;
    fs::File::create(&Path::new("/").join("output.txt"))?;
    fs::create_dir("docs")?;
    fs::create_dir(&Path::new("/").join("docs"))?;
    Ok(())
}
```
This code does the same as your Java code, it creates a file "output.txt" in the current directory and "/" (root) directory, and it also creates an empty directory named "docs". Note that you'll need to have the necessary permissions for creating files/directories at the root level.

Also, this Rust version catches the `io::Error` that can occur when trying to create a file or a directory, so be sure to handle it appropriately in your real-world application.
