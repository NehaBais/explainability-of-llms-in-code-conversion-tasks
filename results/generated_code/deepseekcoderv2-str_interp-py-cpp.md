# Answer: 
## In C++, this code can be translated as follows:
```
string extra = "little";
string new_str = "Mary had a " + extra + " lamb.";
cout << new_str << endl;
```
This code defines two variables, `extra` and `new_str`. The variable `extra` is initialized with the string value "little". The variable `new_str` is then assigned the result of concatenating three strings: "Mary had a ", the value stored in the variable `extra`, and the substring " lamb.". Finally, the concatenated string is printed to standard output.
