Here is the Python equivalent of your Java code:

```python
def logic(A, b):
    print("A AND b: ", A and b)
    print("A OR b: ", A or b)
    print("NOT a: ", not A)
```

Note that in Python, the `and`, `or` keywords work in a way similar to Java's `&&` and `||` operators. The `not` keyword is also used similarly.
