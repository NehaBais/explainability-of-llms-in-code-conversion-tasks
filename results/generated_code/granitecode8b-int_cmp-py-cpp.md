Here's the converted code from Python to C++:
```
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
 int a, b;
 
 cout << "Enter value of a: ";
 cin >> a;
 
 cout << "Enter value of b: ";
 cin >> b;
 
 if (a < b) {
 cout << "a is less than b" << endl;
 } else if (a > b) {
 cout << "a is greater than b" << endl;
 } else if (a == b) {
 cout << "a is equal to b" << endl;
 }
 
 return 0;
}
```
To test the condition, you can enter different values for `a` and `b`, and observe the output. Here are some examples:
- If `a` is less than `b`, then the program should output "a is less than b".
- If `a` is greater than `b`, then the program should output "a is greater than b".
- If `a` is equal to `b`, then the program should output "a is equal to b".
