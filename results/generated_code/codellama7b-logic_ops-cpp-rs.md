This code will take two boolean values and print out the result of "and", "or", and "not" on both arguments. In Rust, this can be done using the following code:

```rust
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("{}", a && b); // prints the result of "and" operation on both args
    println!("{}", a || b); // prints the result of "or" operation on both args
    println!("{}", !a); // prints the result of "not" operation on first arg
}
```
The code above uses println!() function to print out the result of each operation.
