 Sure, here is the equivalent Java code for the given C++ code:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String greeting = "Hello";
        greeting += " , world!";
        System.out.println(greeting);
    }
}
```

In this Java code:
1. A string variable `greeting` is initialized with the value `"Hello"`.
2. The `+=` operator is used to append the string literal `", world!"` to the existing string.
3. The contents of the variable are printed using `System.out.println()`.
