Below is the equivalent code in Golang:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	for _, path := range []string{"input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", "/docs"} {
		if _, err := os.Stat(path); os.IsNotExist(err) {
			fmt.Printf("%s does not exist\n", path)
		} else if info, _ := os.Stat(path); info.IsDir() {
			fmt.Printf("%s is a directory\n", path)
		} else {
			fmt.Printf("%s is a file\n", path)
		}
	}
}
```

This code uses the `os` package to perform the same file and directory existence checks as the original Rust code. It iterates over the specified paths, and for each one, it first checks whether it exists using the `os.Stat` function. If it does not exist (`os.IsNotExist(err)`), it prints that the path does not exist.

If the path exists, it then checks if it is a directory or a file by calling `os.Stat` again, this time storing the result in the `info` variable. Then it uses `info.IsDir()` to determine whether the path is a directory or not.

Please note that the error handling here assumes that any error other than "not exist" should be treated as an inability to distinguish between file and directory; which might not always be true. A more complete implementation would handle different kinds of errors in a more nuanced way.
