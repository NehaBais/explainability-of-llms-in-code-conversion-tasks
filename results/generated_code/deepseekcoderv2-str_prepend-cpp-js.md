 To convert the given C++ code to JavaScript, we need to follow these steps:

1. Create a string variable equal to any text value.
2. Prepend the string variable with another string literal.
3. Use an array (or vector in C++) to store strings and then concatenate them using a reduce function (similar to `std::accumulate`).
4. Print the result to the console.

Here is the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
let myStrings = ["prepended to", "my string"];
let prepended = myStrings.reduce((acc, str) => acc + str, "");
console.log(prepended);
```

Explanation:
- We use an array `myStrings` to store the strings.
- The `reduce` method is used to concatenate all elements in the array into a single string (`""` as the initial value).
- Finally, we print the concatenated string using `console.log`.
