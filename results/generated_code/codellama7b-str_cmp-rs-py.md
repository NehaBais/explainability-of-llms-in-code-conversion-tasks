This code is in Rust and it compares two strings and shows what kind of comparisons can be done, including case-insensitive and case-sensitive comparisons. Here's the converted code to Python:
```
# The use statement has been removed because it requires additional dependencies that are not included in the standard library of Python.

def main():
    a = "abc"  # string literal
    b = "Bac".upper()  # creates an uppercase version of the string, equivalent to the Rust code using .to_ascii_uppercase()

    if a == b:
        print("The strings are equal")
    if a != b:
        print("The strings are not equal")
    if a > b:
        print("The first string is lexically after the second")
    if a < b:
        print("The first string is lexically before the second")
    if a >= b:
        print("The first string is not lexically before the second")
    if a <= b:
        print("The first string is not lexically after the second")

    # Case-insensitives:
    if a.lower() == b.lower():
        print("Both strings are equal when ignoring case")

# Repeat checks with lowercase versions of the strings.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
The code creates two string variables, one containing a string literal and the other created using the `upper()` method to create an uppercase version of the original string. The program then performs various comparisons on the two strings, including exact equality, inequality, lexical ordering, and case-insensitive comparison.
