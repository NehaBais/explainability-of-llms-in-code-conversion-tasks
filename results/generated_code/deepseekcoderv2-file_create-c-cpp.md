 Here's the equivalent C++ code to achieve the same functionality as your provided C code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main() {
    // Create an empty file "output.txt" in the current working directory
    std::ofstream outFile("output.txt");
    if (!outFile) {
        std::cerr << "Error creating output.txt" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    outFile.close();

    // Create an empty directory "docs" in the current working directory
    int mkdir_result = mkdir("docs", 0750);
    if (mkdir_result != 0) {
        std::cerr << "Error creating docs directory" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Repeat the same operations for the filesystem root
    int fd = open("/output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0640);
    if (fd == -1) {
        std::cerr << "Error creating output.txt in root" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    close(fd);

    mkdir("/docs", 0750);

    return 0;
}
```

Note: In the C++ version, I used `std::ofstream` to create and manage the file. For creating a file in the root directory, you need superuser privileges or appropriate permissions, which is not directly supported by standard library functions in user space. The code above assumes that the current user has sufficient permissions to create files and directories in both the current working directory and the root directory. If running as a non-root user, you might need to adjust the permissions settings accordingly.
