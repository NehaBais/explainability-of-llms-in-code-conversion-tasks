 In Python, you can achieve the same functionality as follows:

```python
string = "abc"
print(string)  # Outputs: abc
string += "def"
print(string)  # Outputs: abcdef
```
In this code, the variable `string` starts with a value of `"abc"`. The `+=` operator appends another string `"def"` to `string`, and then `print()` function is used to display the contents of the variable.
