The Python code to create a new empty file and an empty directory is slightly different from the C code. Here is how you can do this in Python:

```python
import os

# Create the files/directories twice, once here and once in the root
paths = ['.', '/']
for path in paths:
    # Create an empty file
    with open(os.path.join(path, 'output.txt'), 'w') as f:
        pass
    
    # Create an empty directory
    os.mkdir(os.path.join(path, 'docs'))
```

This Python code does the same thing as your C code. It creates a new empty file called "output.txt" and an empty directory called "docs".
