To convert the given JavaScript code to Rust, you can use the `std::fs` module for file and directory operations. Here's how you can do it:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Create an empty file called "output.txt" in the current working directory
    fs::write("output.txt", "")?;
    
    // Create an empty file called "/output.txt" in the filesystem root
    fs::write("/output.txt", "")?;

    // Create an empty directory called "docs" in the current working directory
    fs::create_dir("docs")?;
    
    // Create an empty directory called "/docs" in the filesystem root
    fs::create_dir("/docs")?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing Modules**: The `std::fs` module provides functions for file system operations, and `std::io` is used for handling I/O errors.
2. **Main Function**: The `main` function returns an `io::Result<()>`, which is a common convention in Rust to handle I/O operations that can fail.
3. **Creating Files**:
   - `fs::write("output.txt", "")?;`: This creates an empty file named "output.txt" in the current working directory.
   - `fs::write("/output.txt", "")?;`: This creates an empty file named "/output.txt" at the filesystem root.
4. **Creating Directories**:
   - `fs::create_dir("docs")?;`: This creates an empty directory named "docs" in the current working directory.
   - `fs::create_dir("/docs")?;`: This creates an empty directory named "/docs" at the filesystem root.

### Notes:
- The `?` operator is used to propagate errors. If any of these operations fail, the function will return an `io::Error`.
- Ensure that your Rust program has the necessary permissions to create files and directories in the specified locations. Running the program as a regular user might require elevated permissions (e.g., using `sudo`).
