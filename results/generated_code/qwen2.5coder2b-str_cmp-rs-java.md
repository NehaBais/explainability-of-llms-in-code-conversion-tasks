In Java, the String class does not have built-in support for case insensitivity or numeric string comparison. However, you can use the built-in `equals` method along with the `equalsIgnoreCase` method to compare strings. For numeric string comparison, you need to convert them to integers using `Integer.parseInt()` and then use the `compareTo` method.

Here is how you could translate your Rust code to Java:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String a = "abc";
        String b = "Bac";

        // Strings are already compared as they are in Java
        if (a.equals(b)) { System.out.println("The strings are equal");
        }
        else { System.out.println("The strings are not equal");

        if (a.compareTo(b) > 0) { System.out.println("The first string is lexically after the second");
        }
        else if (a.compareTo(b) < 0) { System.out.println("The first string is lexically before the second");
        }

        // case-insensitives:
        String a2 = a.toUpperCase();
        String b2 = b.toUpperCase();

        // repeat checks
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **String Comparison**: The `equals` method in Java compares two strings for equality, ignoring case.
2. **Lexical Comparison**: Java uses the `compareTo` method for comparing two strings lexicographically. If the first string is lexically greater than the second, it returns a positive integer; if it is less than the second, it returns a negative integer; otherwise, it returns 0.
3. **Case Insensitive Comparisons**: The `toUpperCase()` method converts the strings to uppercase before performing comparisons. This avoids creating new strings during comparison.

This approach ensures that your Java code behaves similarly to Rust in terms of string comparisons and comparisons with numeric types.
