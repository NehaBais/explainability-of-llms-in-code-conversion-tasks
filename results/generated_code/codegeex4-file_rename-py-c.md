The equivalent code in C would be:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void renameFilesAndDirectories(const char* dirPath) {
    if (rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0) {
        perror("Error renaming input.txt");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    if (rename("docs", "mydocs") != 0) {
        perror("Error renaming docs");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Rename in the current working directory
    renameFilesAndDirectories("");

    // Rename in the filesystem root
    char rootPath[1024];
    if (getcwd(rootPath, sizeof(rootPath)) != NULL) {
        renameFilesAndDirectories(rootPath);
    } else {
        perror("Error getting current working directory");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Please note that to compile and run the C program, you would need to have write access in both the current working directory (where the script is) and the root directory. The C standard library does not provide a method to obtain the filesystem root directory automatically, so you may need to modify the code if it's intended for execution on different systems or with different configurations.

Moreover, this example assumes that `input.txt` and `docs` exist in both the current working directory and the root directory. If they don't, you might want to add some error handling to avoid undefined behavior.
