The equivalent Python code for the JavaScript code provided would be:
```python
s = "hello"
s += " there!"  # s is now equal to "hello there!"
print(s)
```
In this code, `+=` means append. So `s += " there!"` is equivalent to `s = s + " there!"`. This results in `s` being updated with the new value, which you can see printed out at the end of the code.
