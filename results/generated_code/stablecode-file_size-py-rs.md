Rust is a statically-typed programming language, primarily developed for web and mobile applications by the Rust Project team. 

Although Rust has excellent support for dealing with files and directories (known as 'std::fs' and 'std::path' respectively) compared to Python, some functionality may be limited, such as direct file path traversal like in Python's `os.path.getsize('/input.txt')`)

Given that we can't use any libraries that are specifically designed for filesystem operations (like `pathlib`), the most straightforward way to perform these operations would be through system calls. 

Here is how you might implement this in Rust:

```rust
use std::io;
use std::fs;
use std::os::unix::fs::MetadataExt;

fn get_file_sizes() {
    let mut paths = vec!["input.txt"], vec!["/input.txt"]];

    for i in 0..paths.len() { 
        match fs::metadata(paths[i].first()) {
            Ok(meta) => println!("{}' size is {} bytes.", paths[i].first(), meta.size()),
            Err(_) => println!("Could not get the metadata of '{}'.";, paths[i].first()),
        }
    }
 }


```
This Rust code first creates two vectors containing the file paths to be analyzed, one for the file in the current working directory and another one for the file system root.

The `fs::metadata` function is used inside a match block to retrieve the metadata of the file specified by each path in the vectors. The metadata's size is then printed using `println!`.

If there is an error while retrieving the metadata, the error message is printed using `println!`.

This code can be executed on Unix-like operating systems as it uses the `std::os::unix::fs::MetadataExt` trait for retrieving the size of a file.
```
