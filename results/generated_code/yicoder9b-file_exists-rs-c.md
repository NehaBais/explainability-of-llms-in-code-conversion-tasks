The equivalent C code for the above Rust program would be: 
Please note that C doesn't have as robust filesystem and error-handling capabilities as Rust. Therefore, the C version will only print whether a file or directory exists without distinguishing between them. 
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int main() {
    struct stat buffer;
    const char *files[] = {"input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", "/docs"};
    size_t n = sizeof files / sizeof files[0];

    for(size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (stat(files[i], &buffer) != 0) {
            printf("%s does not exist\n", files[i]);
        } else if (S_ISDIR(buffer.st_mode)){
            printf("%s is a directory\n", files[i]);
        }else if (S_ISREG(buffer.st_mode)) {
            printf("%s is a file\n", files[i]);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This program uses the `stat` function to get information about the file or directory specified by the path. If it exists, it will print if it's a directory or a file. If it doesn't exist, it will print that it does not exist.
