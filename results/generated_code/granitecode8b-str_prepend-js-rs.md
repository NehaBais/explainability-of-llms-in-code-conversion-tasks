Here's the Rust code that meets the requirements:
```
let mut s = String::from(", World");
s.prepend("Hello ");
println!("{}", s);
```
In this code, we first create a `String` variable `s` and initialize it with the value ", World". Then, we use the `prepend()` method to add "Hello " to the beginning of the string. Finally, we print the resulting string using `println!()`.
