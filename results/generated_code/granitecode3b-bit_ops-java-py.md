Here's the Python code that performs the same operations as the Java code you provided:
```
def bitwise(a, b):
 print("a AND b:", a & b)
 print("a OR b:", a | b)
 print("a XOR b:", a ^ b)
 print("NOT a:", ~a)
 print("a << b:", a << b) # left shift
 print("a >> b:", a >> b) # arithmetic right shift
 print("a >>> b:", a >> b) # logical right shift
 print("a rol b:", a << b) #rotate left, Java 1.5+
 print("a ror b:", a >> b) #rotate right, Java 1.5+
```
Note that Python does not have the bitwise NOT operator (~), so we use the bitwise complement (~) operator instead. Also, Python uses bitwise shifts and rotates that are different from Java. Specifically, Python's bitwise left shift is implemented as a left shift by one position, while Java's left shift is implemented as a left shift by zero or more positions (depending on the sign of the second operand). Additionally, Python's right shift and logical right shift operators are implemented differently than Java's.
