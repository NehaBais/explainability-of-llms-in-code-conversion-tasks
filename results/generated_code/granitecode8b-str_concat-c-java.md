Here is the Java code that fulfills the given requirements:
```java
public class StringConcat {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 String s = "hello";
 String s2 = s + " literal";
 
 System.out.println(s + " literal");
 // or
 System.out.println(s + s2);
 
 char[] s3 = new char[s.length() + 9];
 System.arraycopy(s.toCharArray(), 0, s3, 0, s.length());
 System.arraycopy(" literal".toCharArray(), 0, s3, s.length(), 9);
 String s4 = new String(s3);
 
 System.out.println(s4);
 }
}
```
The output of the code will be:

hello literal
hello literal
hello literal

Explanation:
1. The first two lines create a string variable `s` with the value "hello".
2. The third line creates a new string variable `s2` by concatenating the original `s` variable with another string literal " literal".
3. The fourth and fifth lines print the content of `s` and `s2` using two different ways.
4. The next few lines create a new character array `s3` with a length equal to the sum of the lengths of `s` and " literal".
5. The `System.arraycopy()` method is used to copy the characters from `s` and " literal" into `s3`.
6. Finally, a new string variable `s4` is created using the `s3` array.
Note: This Java code does not include error handling or memory management for brevity. In a real-world application, these aspects should be considered carefully.
