To convert the code from Go to JavaScript, we can use Node.js's built-in `fs` module for file system operations. We will also need to install the `path` package to work with file paths.

Here is the converted code:
```
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Rename files and directories here
fs.renameSync(path.join(__dirname, 'input.txt'), path.join(__dirname, 'output.txt'));
fs.renameSync(path.join(__dirname, 'docs'), path.join(__dirname, 'mydocs'));

// Rename files and directories in the root directory
fs.renameSync('/input.txt', '/output.txt');
fs.renameSync('/docs', '/mydocs');
```
The `fs` module provides methods for working with file systems in Node.js, such as creating, reading, writing, and renaming files and directories. The `path` package is used to work with file paths, which can be passed to the `fs` module's functions to specify the location of the file or directory to operate on.

The code first defines two variables: `fs` and `path`. The `fs` variable is assigned the `require('fs')` function, which returns a reference to the Node.js `fs` module. The `path` variable is assigned the `require('path')` function, which returns a reference to the `path` package.

The code then defines two functions: `renameFile` and `renameDirectory`. These functions use the `fs` module's `renameSync()` method to rename files and directories. The `renameSync()` method takes two arguments: the first is a string specifying the current location of the file or directory, and the second is a string specifying the new location of the file or directory.

The `renameFile` function renames the file "input.txt" in the current working directory to "output.txt", and the `renameDirectory` function renames the directory "docs" in the current working directory to "mydocs". The functions also rename the same files and directories in the root directory by specifying their absolute paths.

Note that the code assumes that the user has the necessary permissions to perform the file system operations.
