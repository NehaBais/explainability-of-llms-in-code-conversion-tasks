This is a simple Go program that creates two string variables (one with some text and the other one with a different text). The original requirement states: "Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal." 

The equivalent C program would look like this:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    char *s = "hello";
    printf("%s\n", s);
    
    // concatenate variable and literal, assign result to another string variable
    char *s2 = malloc(strlen(s) + strlen(" literal") + 1);
    strcpy(s2, s);
    strcat(s2, " literal");
    printf("%s\n", s2);

    free(s2); // remember to release memory allocated with 'malloc' 
    return 0;
}
```
The Go and C code have similar functionalities. The only difference between the two is that in C we use `malloc` to allocate enough space for the concatenated string and then use `strcpy` (or `strncpy`, depending on whether or not you want to ensure that the original text is null-terminated) to copy the original text into the newly allocated memory. After that, we concatenate the original text with the literal using `strcat`. Finally, we release the dynamically allocated string by calling `free` and returning zero (0) as our program's exit code.
