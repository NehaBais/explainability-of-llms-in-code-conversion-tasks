Here is the equivalent Java code for the given Rust program. It creates a new empty file and an empty directory both in the current working directory and filesystem root twice. The exit process is handled if any error occurs during this operation.

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;

public class Main {
    private static final String FILE_NAME = "output.txt";
    private static final String DIR_NAME = "docs";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            create(Paths.get("."));
            create(Paths.get("/"));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            errorHandler(e, 1);
        }
    }

    private static void create(Path root) throws IOException {
        Path filePath = Paths.get(root.toString(), FILE_NAME);
        Path dirPath = Paths.get(root.toString(), DIR_NAME);
        Files.createFile(filePath);
        Files.createDirectory(dirPath);
    }

    private static void errorHandler(Exception e, int code) {
        System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        System.exit(code);
    }
}
```
This Java code does the same thing as your Rust program but it's written in a more verbose way to make it easier for you to understand if you are new to Java. The try-catch block is used to handle any `IOException` that may occur during the execution of the `create()` method. If an exception occurs, the `errorHandler()` method will be called with provided error message and exit code.
