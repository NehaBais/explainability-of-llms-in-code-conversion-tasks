The Java code you provided is not directly related to creating directories or any parent directories, as it creates a directory object and then attempts to create it with mkdirs(). You can use the C function mkdir() instead of mkdirs() in C to achieve this. Here is how you could convert this into C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int main(void) {
    int ret = 0;

    /* Create the directory */
    ret = mkdir("C:/parent/test", S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH);

    if (ret == -1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create directory: %s\n", strerror(errno));
    } else {
        printf("Directory created successfully.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Here, we include the necessary headers and then use mkdir() with appropriate permissions (S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, and S_IROTH) to create the directory. If the operation is successful, it prints "Directory created successfully." on the screen. Otherwise, an error message is printed to stderr using perror().

Remember that C does not have a direct equivalent of Java's File class or mkdirs() method. This conversion involves understanding and implementing the basic Unix functions for creating directories in C.
