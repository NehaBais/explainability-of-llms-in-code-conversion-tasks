Here's the equivalent Python code for your Go function:

```python
def print_logic(A, B):
    print('A and B is', A and B)
    print('A or B is', A or B)
    print('not A is', not A)

# Example usage:
print_logic(True, True)
```

This function works the same way as your Go function. It takes two boolean arguments `A` and `B`, then prints the results of applying logical operations to them. The keyword `and` and `or` are used for logical AND and OR in Python, respectively. The `not` operator is just like its counterpart in Go, but it applies to a single argument.
