Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task as the Golang code you provided:
```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
text = "hello"
# output string variable
print(text)
# this output requested by original task description, although not really required by current wording of task description.
print(text + " literal")
# concatenate variable and literal, assign result to another string variable
text2 = text + " literal"
# output second string variable
print(text2)
```
In this Python code, we first create a string variable called `text` and assign it the value `"hello"`. We then print the contents of `text` using the `print()` function. Next, we concatenate the contents of `text` with the literal string `" literal"` and store the result in another string variable called `text2`. Finally, we print the contents of `text2`. The output of this code should be:

hello
hello literal
hello literal
