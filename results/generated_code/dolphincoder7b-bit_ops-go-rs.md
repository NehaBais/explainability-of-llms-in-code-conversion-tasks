This is a very complex task and it's hard to cover every detail due to the complexity of the code. Let me provide an example and you can use it as reference.

```rust
use std::fmt;

fn bitwise(a: i16, b: u8) {
    println!("a:    {:016b}", a);
    println!("b:    {:016b}", b);

    // Bitwise logical operations
    println!("and:  {:016b}", a & (i16::from(b)));
    println!("or:   {:016b}", a | (i16::from(b)));
    println!("xor:  {:016b}", a ^ (i16::from(b)));
    println!("not:  {:016b}", !a);

    if b < 0 {
        eprintln!("Right operand is negative, but all shifts require an unsigned right operand (shift distance).");
        return;
    }
    let ua = a as u32; // type casting to unsigned
    let ub = b as u32;

    // Logical shifts (unsigned left operand)
    println!("shl:  {:016b}", ua << ub);
    println!("shr:  {:016b}", ua >> ub);

    // Arithmetic shifts (signed left operand)
    println!("las:  {:016b}", a as i32 << ub);
    println!("ras:  {:016b}", a as i32 >> ub);

    // Rotations
    let a_as_u32 = a as u32; // converting signed to unsigned for rotating left
    println!("rol:  {:016b}", (a_as_u32 << ub) | ((a_as_u32 & 0xffff0000) >> (32 - ub)));
    println!("ror:  {:016b}", ((a as u32 >> ub) | (a_as_u32 & (1 << (ub - 1)) - 1)) as i16);
}

fn main() {
    let a = -460;
    let b: u8 = 6;

    bitwise(a, b);
}
```

Please note that Rust doesn't support the `printf` style formatting in the same way like Golang. In this case, we use the built-in function `println!` to print the formatted output. For example, `{:016b}` formats a binary number with leading zeros up to 16 digits long.

The rest of the code follows the same logic as in the original Golang code. However, Rust doesn't have direct equivalents for Golang's `int16` and `uint16` types, so we use `i16` (signed integer) and `u16` (unsigned integer). 

For rotations, Rust does not have a built-in rotation operation. To perform the rotations, you need to calculate the upper 16 bits (`a_as_u32 & 0xffff0000`) separately and then use bitwise OR (`|`) with the lower 16 bits shifted by the number of bits in the upper part. This is done in the `ror` function. The shift distance for the left rotation (rol) is different from that for the right one, so we calculate it separately using `(a_as_u32 & 0xffff0000) >> (32 - ub)`.

Also note that Rust requires explicit type casting when performing arithmetic shifts (`>>` and `<<`). This is because in Golang, a negative shift distance is treated as the number of bits to right-shift. However, this behavior does not exist in Rust where a negative shift distance is illegal. To work around this, we convert the integer type to an unsigned one before performing the shifts (`a as u32` and `a as i32`).

Overall, you can see how it's possible to translate Golang code into Rust without changing the core functionality of the algorithm, but there are some differences in syntax and idioms that may require adjustments.
