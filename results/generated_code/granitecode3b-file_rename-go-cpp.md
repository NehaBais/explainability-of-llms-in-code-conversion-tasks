Here's the C++ code that accomplishes the same task:
```
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 std::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
 std::rename("docs", "mydocs");
 std::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
 std::rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
 return 0;
}
```
Note that this code assumes that the user has the necessary permissions to rename files and directories in both the current working directory and the root filesystem.
