 Here's how you can convert this JavaScript code to Java:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "hello";
        System.out.println(s + " there!");
    }
}
```
The above Java code does the same operation as your JavaScript code, creating a string variable `s` and then printing out its value concatenated with another string literal `" there!"`.
