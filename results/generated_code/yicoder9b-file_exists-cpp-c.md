In C, we don't have the std::filesystem library, so instead we will use functions from the unistd.h and sys/stat.h libraries to check if a file or directory exists.
Here is how you can implement it:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

void file_exists(const char* path) {
    struct stat buffer;
    if ( stat(path, &buffer) != -1 ) {  // The file exists
        if ( S_ISDIR(buffer.st_mode) ) { // Check if it's a directory
            printf("%s is a directory\n", path);
        } else {
            printf("%s exists with a size of %d bytes\n", path, buffer.st_size ); 
        }
    }  else { // The file does not exist
        printf("%s does not exist\n", path);
    }
}

int main() {
    file_exists("input.txt");
	// Add here other paths you want to check in the current directory

    file_exists("/docs/input.txt");
    // Add here other paths you want to check at root

    return 0;
}
```
This C code does essentially the same thing as your original C++ code: it checks if a file or directory exists and prints an appropriate message, then checks some other paths that are specified in comments. You can replace those path names with the ones you want to check.
