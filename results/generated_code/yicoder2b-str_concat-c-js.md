Sure, here is the equivalent JavaScript code for the given C program:

```javascript
// In JavaScript
const s = 'hello'; 
let s2;

console.log(`${s}`);  // Outputs: hello
console.log(`${s} literal`); // Outputs: hello literal

s2 = s + ' literal' ; 
console.log(s2); // Outputs: helloliteral
```
This code does the same thing as your C program - it concatenates a string with another string and logs both the original string, its literal version, and the resulting string to the console.
