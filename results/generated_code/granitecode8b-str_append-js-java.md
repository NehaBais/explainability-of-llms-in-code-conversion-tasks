Here's the converted Java code that meets your requirements:
```
String s1 = "Hello";
s1 += ", World!";
System.out.println(s1);
```
In this Java code, we first declare a string variable `s1` and initialize it with the value "Hello". Then, we use the `+=` operator to append the string literal ", World!" to the end of `s1`. Finally, we print the contents of `s1` using `System.out.println()`.
