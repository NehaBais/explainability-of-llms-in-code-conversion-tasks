Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for creating an empty file and directory as per your requirements:

```python
import os

# Function to create a new empty file of size 0 bytes
def create_empty_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        pass

# Function to create an empty directory
def create_directory(dir_path):
    os.makedirs(dir_path, exist_ok=True)

# Create the files and directories in the current working directory
create_empty_file('output.txt')
create_directory('docs')

# Create the files and directories in the filesystem root (requires elevated permissions)
root_dir = '/'
create_empty_file(root_dir + 'output.txt')
create_directory(root_dir + 'docs')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing `os` module**: This is used for interacting with the operating system.
2. **`create_empty_file(file_path)` function**: This function opens a file at the specified path in write mode, which creates an empty file.
3. **`create_directory(dir_path)` function**: This function uses `os.makedirs()` to create a directory at the specified path. The `exist_ok=True` parameter ensures that it doesn't raise an error if the directory already exists.
4. **Creating files and directories**:
   - In the current working directory, it creates `output.txt` and `docs`.
   - In the filesystem root (`/`), it tries to create `output.txt` and `docs`. Note that you might need elevated permissions (e.g., running as an administrator) to write in the root directory on most operating systems.

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create files and directories in the root directory.
