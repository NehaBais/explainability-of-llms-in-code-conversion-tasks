Here's the JavaScript equivalent of your Golang code:

```javascript
function printLogic(a, b) {
  console.log("a AND b is " + (a && b));
  console.log("a OR b is " + (a || b));
  console.log("NOT a is " + (!a));
}
```

This JavaScript function takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and uses the logical operators `&&` for "and", `||` for "or", and `!` for "not". The result of each operation is then logged to the console.
