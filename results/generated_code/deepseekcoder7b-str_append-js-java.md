Here is your JavaScript code converted to Java:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "Hello";
        s1 += ", World!";
        System.out.println(s1);
    }
}
```
This will print out `Hello, World!`. This is similar to the JavaScript code you provided: it creates a string variable `s1` and appends another string literal to it, then prints its value. 

In Java, we use "+=" operator for concatenation of strings in a more idiomatic way than in JavaScript. The result is stored back in the variable s1 which is printed out at the end using System.out.println().
