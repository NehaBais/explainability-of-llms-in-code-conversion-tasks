Here is the equivalent Python code for your requirements:

```python
def string_matching(str1, str2):

    # Determining if the first string starts with second string
    print(str1.startswith(str2))) 

    # Determining if the first string contains the second string at any location
    print(str1.find(str2)) != -1) 

    # Determining if the first string ends with the second string
    print(str1.endswith(str2))))
```

This Python script will print out whether each of your three conditions are met for each pair of strings you test.

For the optional requirements:
If you want to print the location of the match for part 2, replace 'print' with 'print("Match found at index:", loc))' in the string_matching function.

If you want to handle multiple occurrences of a string for part 2, you'll need more specific logic than can be provided here.
