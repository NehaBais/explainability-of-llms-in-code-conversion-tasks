Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
s = "hello"
print(s)

s1 = s + " world"
print(s1)
```
This Python script does exactly what your Rust code does. It declares a string `s`, and prints its value to the console. Then it concatenates another string literal to `s` and stores the result in `s1`. Finally, it prints out the value of `s1`.
