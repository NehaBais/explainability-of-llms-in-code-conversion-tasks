Here's your GoLang code converted into Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = "world!".to_string();
    let hello = "Hello, ".to_string();
    s = format!("{}{}", hello, s));

    println!("{}", s));
}
```
This Rust code does exactly the same as your GoLang code: It declares a mutable string variable `s`, initializes it with the text value "world!". Then, it prepends another string literal "Hello, " to the string variable `s`. Finally, it prints out the resulting string.
