Here is the converted code from C to C++ that renames a file called input.txt into output.txt and a directory called docs into mydocs, both in the current working directory and in the filesystem root:
```
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 std::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
 std::rename("docs", "mydocs");
 std::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
 std::rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
 return 0;
}
```
Note that the function `std::rename` is used instead of `rename`. Also, the file and directory names are enclosed in quotation marks to ensure that they are treated as strings rather than as variable names.
