To convert the given JavaScript code to Rust, you can use the `std::fs` module which provides a portable interface for file system operations. Below is the equivalent Rust code that performs the same tasks:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Define the source and destination paths for files and directories
    let current_dir = env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR");
    
    // Current working directory operations
    let input_path = Path::new(current_dir).join("input.txt");
    let output_path = Path::new(current_dir).join("output.txt");
    fs::rename(&input_path, &output_path)?;

    let docs_path = Path::new(current_dir).join("docs");
    let mydocs_path = Path::new(current_dir).join("mydocs");
    fs::rename(&docs_path, &mydocs_path)?;

    // Filesystem root operations
    let c_root_path = Path::new("/").join("input.txt");
    let c_output_path = Path::new("/").join("output.txt");
    fs::rename(&c_root_path, &c_output_path)?;

    let c_docs_path = Path::new("/").join("docs");
    let c_mydocs_path = Path::new("/").join("mydocs");
    fs::rename(&c_docs_path, &c_mydocs_path)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Imports**:
   - `std::fs`: Provides functions for working with the file system.
   - `std::path::{Path, PathBuf}`: Provides types for manipulating file paths.
   - `std::io`: Required to handle I/O operations.

2. **Current Working Directory Operations**:
   - The current working directory is obtained using `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`, which is a convenient way to get the path of the crate's root directory.
   - Paths are constructed using `Path::new(current_dir).join("file.txt")`.
   - The `fs::rename` function is used to rename files and directories.

3. **Filesystem Root Operations**:
   - Similar to the current working directory operations, paths are constructed starting from the filesystem root ("/").
   - Note: Renaming files or directories at the filesystem root might require appropriate permissions and may not work in all environments (e.g., restricted environments like Docker containers).

### Running the Code:

To run this Rust code, you can use a Rust environment. Save the code to a file named `main.rs` and then execute it using the following command:

cargo run --release

This will compile and run your Rust program. The operations specified in the JavaScript code will be performed accordingly.
