Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task as the JavaScript code you provided:
```
def logic(a, b):
 print("a AND b: ", a and b)
 print("a OR b: ", a or b)
 print("NOT a: ", not a)
```
In this Python code, we define a function called `logic` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`. We use the logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` to perform the desired operations on the input values. The `print` statement is used to output the results of these operations.
