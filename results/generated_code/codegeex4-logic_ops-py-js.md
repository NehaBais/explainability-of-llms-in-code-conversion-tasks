Here is your Python code converted to JavaScript:

```javascript
function logic(a, b) {
    console.log(`a and b: ${a && b}`);
    console.log(`a or b: ${a || b}`);
    console.log(`not a: ${!a}`);
}
```

The JavaScript `&&` operator corresponds to the Python `and`, the `||` operator to `or`, and the `!` operator to `not`. Note that in JavaScript, string interpolation is done with backticks (\`) and `${}` rather than `%()` as in Python.
