To convert the code from Java to Python, you can use the following implementation:
```
def logic(a, b):
    print(f"a AND b: {a and b}")
    print(f"a OR b: {a or b}")
    print(f"NOT a: {not a}")
```
Explanation:

* In Java, the `&&` operator is used for "and" operation, while the `||` operator is used for "or" operation. Similarly, the `!` operator is used for "not" operation.
* In Python, we use the `and`, `or`, and `not` keywords instead of the operators.
* The `print()` function is used to print the output.
* We use f-strings to format the output string with variables.

Note that in Python, the `System.out.println()` method is not necessary because the `print()` function automatically prints to the standard output stream.
