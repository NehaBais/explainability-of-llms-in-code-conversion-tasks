Sure, here is the equivalent code in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <filesystem>

int main() {
    std::string currentPath = "./"; // Current working directory
    std::string rootPath = "/";   // Filesystem root

    // Rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" and "docs" to "mydocs" in the current directory
    try {
        std::filesystem::rename(currentPath + "input.txt", currentPath + "output.txt");
        std::filesystem::rename(currentPath + "docs", currentPath + "mydocs");
    } catch (const std::filesystem::filesystem_error& e) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to rename files in the current directory: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    // Rename "/input.txt" to "/output.txt" and "/docs" to "/mydocs" at the filesystem root
    try {
        std::filesystem::rename(rootPath + "input.txt", rootPath + "output.txt");
        std::filesystem::rename(rootPath + "docs", rootPath + "mydocs");
    } catch (const std::filesystem::filesystem_error& e) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to rename files at the filesystem root: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Header Files**: The `<filesystem>` header provides functionality for interacting with the file system in C++.
2. **Current Directory and Root Path**:
   - `currentPath` is set to `"./"` which represents the current working directory.
   - `rootPath` is set to `"/"` which represents the filesystem root.
3. **Renaming Files**: 
   - The `std::filesystem::rename` function is used to rename files.
   - Error handling using a try-catch block to catch any potential exceptions that might occur during the renaming process.

### Note:
- Ensure that the C++17 standard or later is being used, as it introduces the `<filesystem>` header.
- This code assumes that the user has the necessary permissions to rename files in both the current directory and the filesystem root.
