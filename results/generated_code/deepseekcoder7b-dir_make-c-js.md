JavaScript doesn't have a built-in function for creating directories with missing parents. However, Node.js has the `fs` module that can be used to achieve this functionality. Here is how you could implement it in JavaScript using Node.js:

Firstly, install Node.js and npm if not already installed on your machine. Then create a new file and name it `mkdirp.js` or any other filename you prefer. Now copy the following code into that file:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function mkdirp(targetDir) {
  let sep = require('path').sep;
  let initDir = path.isAbsolute(targetDir) ? sep : '';
  targetDir.split(sep).forEach((folder) => {
    if (folder !== '') {
      initDir += folder + sep;
      if (!fs.existsSync(initDir)) {
        fs.mkdirSync(initDir);
      }

   }
});
``` 

This script uses Node's built-in fs (file system) and path modules to create a function `mkdirp` which takes as input a target directory. The function splits this directory into parts by the platform specific file separator, checks each part if it exists synchronously with `fs.existsSync(initDir)`, and creates non-existent directories in order using `fs.mkdirSync(initDir)`.
