Here's the equivalent Golang code that accomplishes the task of renaming a file and directory in both the current working directory and the root directory:
```
package main
import (
 "fmt"
 "os"
)
func main() {
 err := os.Rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
 if err != nil {
 fmt.Println(err)
 }
 err = os.Rename("docs", "mydocs")
 if err != nil {
 fmt.Println(err)
 }
 err = os.Rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
 if err != nil {
 fmt.Println(err)
 }
 err = os.Rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
 if err != nil {
 fmt.Println(err)
 }
}
```
In this code, we import the `os` package which provides functions for interacting with the operating system. We then use the `Rename` function to rename files and directories. The first call to `Rename` renames "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the current working directory, the second call does the same but in the root directory, the third and fourth calls do the same for the "/input.txt" and "/docs" respectively.
