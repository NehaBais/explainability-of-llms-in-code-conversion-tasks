Here's the equivalent Java code for the given JavaScript code:
```
String original = "Mary had a X lamb";
String little = "little";
String replaced = original.replace("X", little); //changes the original string
```
The `replace()` method is used to replace all occurrences of the specified character sequence in the original string with the specified value. In this case, we are replacing the "X" with the value of the `little` variable. The original string is changed as a result of the `replace()` method call.
