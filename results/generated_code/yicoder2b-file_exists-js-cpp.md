Sure, the equivalent C++ code for your JavaScript code is below: 

```cpp
#include <windows.h>  //For system function in C++
#include <stdio.h>    //For file existence check functions
#include <direct.h>   //For directory operations

int main() {
    HRESULT hr;

    _strset_s(szPath, _countof(szPath), 'C', _T(':'), _T('/'));
    if (!fso.FileExists(szPath)) {
        // The file does not exist
    }

    if (!fso.FolderExists(szPath)) {
        // The folder does not exist
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Please note that you should include the necessary headers and run this code inside an environment which supports ActiveX. The above code uses _chdir to change to C:/ or / for checking file existence, but it only works on Windows systems. If you need to check in a Unix-like system, you'll need to use `system` function to call terminal commands to execute shell commands like 'ls -l' and 'pwd', which may not be suitable for your needs.
Also, please note that the directory operations can only work from Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell. The C++ code will throw an error if you are trying to use it outside of these environments.
