Here's the Python code to rename a file and directory:
```python
import os
# Rename a file
os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt')
# Rename a directory
os.rename('docs', 'mydocs')
# Move a file from the current working directory to another location
os.rename('input.txt', 'c:/output.txt')
# Move a directory from the current working directory to another location
os.rename('docs', 'c:/mydocs')
```
Note: The `os.rename()` function in Python is used to rename a file or directory. It takes two arguments - the old name and the new name. In the case of moving a file or directory, you can use the `shutil` module to achieve this. Here's an example:

import shutil
# Move a file from one location to another
shutil.move('input.txt', 'c:/output.txt')
# Move a directory from one location to another
shutil.move('docs', 'c:/mydocs')

Note that you need to have the necessary permissions to move files and directories in Python. If you encounter any permission errors, you may need to run your script with administrative privileges or change the file or directory permissions.
