This code will need to be converted into JavaScript, but as of now we don't have the ability to execute or run Python code in Node.js environment. However, you can still use this tool to help with the conversion process: https://code2flow.com/.

Please make sure that your input includes all necessary spaces and line breaks for proper formatting. You might need to adjust indentation of the JavaScript code if it doesn't work as expected due to differences in syntax and style between Python and JavaScript.
