Sure! Here is the C++ code for renaming the file input.txt to output.txt and directory docs to mydocs, twice in the current working directory and once in the filesystem root:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Rename file "input.txt" to "output.txt" here
    rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    // Rename directory "docs" to "mydocs" here
    rename("docs", "mydocs");

    // Rename file "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the filesystem root
    rename(getenv("HOME") + "/input.txt", getenv("HOME") + "/output.txt");
    // Rename directory "docs" to "mydocs" in the filesystem root
    rename(getenv("HOME") + "/docs", getenv("HOME") + "/mydocs");

    return 0;
}
```
In this C++ code, we use the `rename` function from the standard library to perform the renaming operations. We also use the `getenv` function to retrieve the home directory of the current user.

Note that in order to rename a file or directory, you need to have appropriate permissions and access rights. Also, it's important to make sure that the new names do not already exist as files or directories in the same directory.
