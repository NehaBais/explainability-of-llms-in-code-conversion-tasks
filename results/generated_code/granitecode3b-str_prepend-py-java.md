Here's the Java code that accomplishes the same task as the Python code:
```java
String s = "12345678";
s = "0" + s; // by concatenation
System.out.println(s);
```
This code declares a `String` variable `s` and assigns it the value of `"12345678"`. It then concatenates a new string literal `"0"` to the beginning of `s` using the `+` operator, resulting in the final value of `"012345678"`. Finally, the code prints the value of `s` to the console using the `System.out.println()` method.
