 Certainly! Below is the Rust code that performs the same operations as your Python code, renaming a file and a directory in both the current working directory and the filesystem root:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    // Rename within the current working directory
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").expect("Failed to rename file in current directory");
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").expect("Failed to rename directory in current directory");

    // Rename within the filesystem root (assuming administrative privileges)
    if let Some(root) = Path::new("/").read_link().ok() {
        let root_str = root.to_string_lossy();
        fs::rename(&format!("{}/input.txt", root_str), &format!("{}/output.txt", root_str)).expect("Failed to rename file in filesystem root");
        fs::rename(&format!("{}/docs", root_str), &format!("{}/mydocs", root_str)).expect("Failed to rename directory in filesystem root");
    } else {
        eprintln!("Failed to determine the filesystem root");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Renaming within the current working directory:**
   - `fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").expect("Failed to rename file in current directory");`
   - `fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").expect("Failed to rename directory in current directory");`
   
   These lines use Rust's standard library `fs::rename` function to rename the specified files and directories within the current working directory. The `.expect` method is used to handle potential errors, panicking if the operation fails.

2. **Renaming within the filesystem root:**
   - `if let Some(root) = Path::new("/").read_link().ok() { ... } else { eprintln!("Failed to determine the filesystem root"); }`
   
   This part of the code attempts to read the root directory path. It assumes that the filesystem root is accessible as `/`. The `Path::new("/").read_link()` method is used to get the root directory, and its string representation is then formatted into a path for renaming.

3. **Error handling:**
   - Each call to `fs::rename` includes an `.expect("Failed to rename ... ")` which will panic if the operation fails, providing a clear error message.

This Rust code mirrors the functionality of your Python script in terms of file and directory renaming, but adapted for Rust's standard library functions and error handling conventions.
