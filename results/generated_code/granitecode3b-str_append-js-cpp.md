Here's the C++ code that accomplishes the same task:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
 string s1 = "Hello";
 s1 += ", World!";
 cout << s1 << endl;
 return 0;
}
```
Output: `Hello, World!`
In C++, the `+=` operator is used to concatenate two strings together. The resulting string is stored back in the variable on which it is applied. The `cout` statement then prints out the contents of the variable.
