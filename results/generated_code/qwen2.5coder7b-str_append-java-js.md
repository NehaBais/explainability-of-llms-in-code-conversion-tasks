Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Java code:

```javascript
let str = "abc";
console.log(str);

str += "def";
console.log(str);
```

In this JavaScript version, `let` keyword is used instead of `String` for declaring a variable. The `+=` operator is used to concatenate and assign the new value back to the variable. The `console.log()` function is used to print out the contents of the variable in JavaScript, equivalent to `System.out.println()` in Java.
