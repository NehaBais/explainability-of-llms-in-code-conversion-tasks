The equivalent Python code for the given JavaScript code is as follows:

```python
import os

def fct(err):
    if err: 
        print(err)

try:
    os.makedirs("docs")

    with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
        pass

    os.rename("/output.txt", "/docs/output.txt"))

    os.makedirs("/docs"))

except Exception as e:
    fct(str(e)))
```
Please note that Python does not support creating files or directories at the root of the filesystem ("/") directly like JavaScript does with `fs.mkdir("/docs", fct);` and `os.rename("/output.txt", "/docs/output.txt"))`. This is because Python's `os` module operates within the context of a single process running on the local machine, not as an administrator operating at the root level of the entire filesystem.

Also, note that in Python, creating empty files and directories is straightforward without needing any special functions or methods like in JavaScript (`fs.writeFile()` and `fs.mkdir()`). This is because in Python, these operations are performed by the built-in `open()` function with appropriate file modes (e.g., "w" for write mode).
