The equivalent code in JavaScript would be:

```javascript
let MyStrings = ["prepended to", "my string"];
let prepended = MyStrings.join("");
console.log(prepended);
```
This JavaScript code does exactly the same as your C++ code. It creates an array of strings, then uses the join() function to concatenate all elements of the array into a single string and finally logs that string to the console.
