Here's how you can convert that JavaScript code into Python:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
s =", World"

# Prepend the string variable with another string literal
s = "Hello" + s

# Print the result
print(s)
```

When this code is executed, it will output: `Hello, World`
