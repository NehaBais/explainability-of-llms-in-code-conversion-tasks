Sure! Here's the equivalent JavaScript code that accomplishes the same thing:
```javascript
function printLogic(a, b) {
  console.log(`a and b is ${a && b}`);
  console.log(`a or b is ${a || b}`);
  console.log(`not a is ${!a}`);
}
```
Note that in JavaScript, logical operators such as `&&` and `||` evaluate to either `true` or `false`, while in C they evaluate to either `1` or `0`. Additionally, the `!` operator negates a boolean value.
