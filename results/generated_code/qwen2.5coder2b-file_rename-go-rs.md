Sure, here is the equivalent Rust code for your requirements:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Rename local files in the current directory and root directory
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").unwrap();
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").unwrap();

    // Rename files in the root directory
    fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt").unwrap();
    fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs").unwrap();
}
```

In this Rust code, `fs::rename` is used to rename files. The `unwrap()` method is used to handle any potential errors that may occur during the renaming process.

Please note that this code only works in Unix-like operating systems where the file system path starts with a slash (`/`). For Windows, you would use the `std::path` crate and use relative paths instead of absolute paths.
