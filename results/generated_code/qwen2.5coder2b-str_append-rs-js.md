Sure, here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Rust code:

```javascript

function main() {
    let hello = "Hello world";
    
    console.log(hello.concat("!!!!"));
}

main();
```

In this JavaScript code, we first create a string variable called `hello` and initialize it with the value "Hello world". Then, we use the `concat()` method to append the string literal "!!!!" to `hello`. Finally, we log the contents of `hello` to the console.
