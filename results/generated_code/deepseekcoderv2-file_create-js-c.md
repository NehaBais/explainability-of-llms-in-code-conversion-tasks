 To convert the given JavaScript code to C, we need to use a library that provides file and directory manipulation capabilities in C. One such library is POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) which includes functions like `fopen`, `fclose`, `fwrite`, `mkdir`, etc.

Here's how you can achieve the same functionality in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

void fct(const char *err_msg) {
    if (err_msg != NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", err_msg);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create file "output.txt" in the current working directory
    FILE *file1 = fopen("output.txt", "w");
    if (file1 == NULL) {
        fct("Error creating file output.txt in current directory");
        return 1;
    }
    fclose(file1);

    // Create file "/output.txt" in the root directory
    FILE *file2 = fopen("/output.txt", "w");
    if (file2 == NULL) {
        fct("Error creating file /output.txt in root directory");
        return 1;
    }
    fclose(file2);

    // Create directory "docs" in the current working directory
    int mkdir_result = mkdir("docs", 0777);
    if (mkdir_result == -1) {
        fct("Error creating directory docs in current directory");
        return 1;
    }

    // Create directory "/docs" in the root directory
    int mkdir_root_result = mkdir("/docs", 0777);
    if (mkdir_root_result == -1) {
        fct("Error creating directory /docs in root directory");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **File Creation**:
   - `fopen("output.txt", "w")`: Opens a file named `output.txt` for writing. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated. If it doesn't exist, it is created.
   - `fopen("/output.txt", "w")`: Tries to open a file named `/output.txt` for writing in the root directory. This operation might not be allowed or valid depending on filesystem permissions and configurations.

2. **Directory Creation**:
   - `mkdir("docs", 0777)`: Creates a new directory named `docs` with default permissions (0777).
   - `mkdir("/docs", 0777)`: Tries to create a new directory named `/docs` in the root directory. This operation might not be allowed or valid depending on filesystem permissions and configurations.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If any of the file or directory creation operations fail, `fct` is called with an error message. The function prints the error message to stderr if it is provided.

### Notes:
- On Windows, the behavior of `mkdir` might differ due to different default permissions and how paths are interpreted. For a more cross-platform solution, consider using libraries like `<sys/stat.h>` for creating directories and file operations.
- The code assumes that the filesystem allows writing files in locations where they may not normally be created (e.g., attempting to write `/output.txt` directly). In real-world applications, you should check if such paths are valid based on your application's requirements and environment.
