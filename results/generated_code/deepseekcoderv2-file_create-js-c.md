### Answer
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

void createFile(const char *filename) {
    FILE *file = fopen(filename, "w"); // Open the file in write mode
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error creating file");
        return;
    }

    fclose(file); // Close the file after writing
}

void createDirectory(const char *dirname) {
    int result = mkdir(dirname, 0755); // Create a directory with default permissions (755)
    if (result != 0) {
        perror("Error creating directory");
    }
}

int main() {
    const char *fileNameHere = "output.txt";
    createFile(fileNameHere);
    createDirectory("./docs"); // Current working directory is "."

    // Create the file in filesystem root
    const char *rootFileName = "/output.txt";
    createFile(rootFileName);
    createDirectory("/docs");

    return 0;
}
```
### Explanation of code:
The C program starts by including necessary header files, such as <stdio.h> for file I/O and <stdlib.h> for memory allocation. The main function is the entry point of the program. It uses the createFile() and createDirectory() functions to create an empty text file named "output.txt" in both the current working directory ("./") and the root ("/").
The function prototype declarations are made at the beginning, along with include statements for <stdio.h> and <stdlib.h>. The main function is where the program execution begins. It calls two functions: createFile() to create an empty text file in both the current working directory ("./") and the root ("/"), and createDirectory() to create a directory named "docs" at these locations.
The C programming language uses include statements to import header files that contain function prototypes, preprocessor macros, and other declarations needed by the program. The main function is where execution begins in most programs written in C. In this case, it simply calls two functions: createFile() (for creating text files) and createDirectory() (for creating directories).
The createFile() function takes a filename as its argument and attempts to open that file for writing using fopen(). If successful, the contents of the file are truncated by setting position indicator at start-of-file (SEEK_SET), then closed with fclose(), so it no longer exists. Otherwise, an error message will be printed indicating what went wrong when opening or closing files, along with other details about where in code this happened and why (e.g., "file not found").
The createDirectory() function takes a directory name as its argument and attempts to create that directory using mkdir(). The third argument is mode information; here we use 0755 which means read/write access for owner, group members only, other users cannot see it or change anything inside except those who have permission granted by the administrator (whoever owns this computer).
