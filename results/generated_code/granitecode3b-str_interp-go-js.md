Sure! Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given Golang code:
```
const str = 'Mary had a ${txt} lamb';
const txt = 'little';
const out = str.replace('${txt}', txt);
console.log(out);
```
In this JavaScript code, we first define the original string `str` and the value of `txt`. Then, we use the `replace()` method to replace the `${txt}` placeholder in the string with the value of `txt`, resulting in the final output.
