Here's the equivalent code in Golang:
```
s1 := "Hello"
s1 += ", World!"
fmt.Println(s1)
```
In Golang, the `+=` operator is used to concatenate two strings together. The variable `s1` is initialized with the string `"Hello"`, and then it is appended with the string literal `", World!"` using the `+=` operator. Finally, the contents of the variable are printed using the `fmt.Println()` function.
