### Response from GPT-4:
Sure, here is the Golang equivalent of the Rust code you provided. Note that I've made a few assumptions about some of the types and functions in the original code to make it more idiomatic Go. These are marked with `// TODO` comments:

```golang
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

const FILE_NAME = "output.txt"
const DIR_NAME = "docs"

func create(root string) error {
    // TODO: Handle errors returned by os.MkdirAll and os.Create
    if err := os.MkdirAll(filepath.Join(root, DIR_NAME), 0755); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to create directory: %w", err)
    }
    // TODO: Handle errors returned by os.Create and filepath.Join
    if _, err := os.Create(filepath.Join(root, FILE_NAME)); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to create file: %w", err)
    }
    return nil
}

func main() {
    // TODO: Handle errors returned by create and errorHandler
    if err := create("."); err != nil {
        errorHandler(err, 1)
    }
    if err := create("/"); err != nil {
        errorHandler(err, 2)
    }
}

func errorHandler(error error, code int) {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error: %v\n", error)
    os.Exit(code)
}
```
### GPT-4 Feedback:
This looks great! The Go implementation is very similar to the Rust version, which means it's a good start for converting from one language to another. As you can see, there are some differences between how errors and arguments (like code in Golang) are handled in both languages. These differences could be explored more fully if desired, but as-is this is a great starting point!
