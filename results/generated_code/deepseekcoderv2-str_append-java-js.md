 Sure! Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for the given Java code:

```javascript
let string = "abc";
console.log(string); // Show the contents of the variable after the append operation
string += "def";
console.log(string); // Show the contents of the variable after the append operation
```

This JavaScript code does the following:
1. Initializes a string variable `string` with the value "abc".
2. Logs the initial content of the string to the console.
3. Appends the string "def" to the existing string.
4. Logs the updated content of the string to the console after appending "def".
