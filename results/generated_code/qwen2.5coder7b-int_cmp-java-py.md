Here's how you can convert the given Java code into Python:
```python
# Get two integers from the user
nbr1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
nbr2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Test the conditions for each case separately
if nbr1 < nbr2:
    print(f"{nbr1} is less than {nbr2}")

if nbr1 > nbr2:
    print(f"{nbr1} is greater than {nbr2}")

if nbr1 == nbr2:
    print(f"{nbr1} is equal to {nbr2}")
```
This Python code will do the same thing as your Java code. It gets two integers from the user, and then prints a message if the first integer is less than, equal to, or greater than the second one.
