The Java code is not directly compatible with C++. However, the equivalent steps in C++ can be achieved using several functions and operators.
Here's how you can implement this in C:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dirent.h>
 
int main() 
{
    DIR *dir;
    struct dirent *ent;
 
    /* Read directory entries */
    dir = opendir("./docs");
    if (dir != NULL) 
    {
        while ((ent = readdir(dir)) != NULL) 
        {
            // Process each entry here...
        }
        closedir(dir);
    } 
    else 
    {
        printf("Failed to open input.txt directory\n");
        return -1;
    }
 
    /* Read files in the filesystem root */
    dir = opendir("/docs/");
    if (dir != NULL) 
    {
        while ((ent = readdir(dir)) != NULL) 
        {
            // Process each entry here...
        }
        closedir(dir);
    } 
    else 
    {
        printf("Failed to open /docs/ directory\n");
        return -1;
    }
 
    return 0;
}
```
In this C program, we're using the `opendir` and `readdir` functions from the `<dirent.h>` library to read files in directories. We can then perform some actions on each file or directory found. 

For example, if you want to print out all the entries in a directory, you can replace the comment "// Process each entry here..." with "printf(\"%s\n\", ent->d_name);".

Note: You need to run this program as root in Linux environment to read files in the filesystem root. If you're running it on Windows or macOS, you'll need to adjust the path in `opendir` function accordingly.
