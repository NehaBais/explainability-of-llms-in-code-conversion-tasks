Here's the Java code that fulfills the given requirement:
```
public class Logic {
 public static void printLogic(boolean a, boolean b) {
 System.out.println("a and b is " + (a && b));
 System.out.println("a or b is " + (a || b));
 System.out.println("not a is " + !a);
 }
}
``` 
Note that in Java, logical values are represented by the boolean data type, and the &&, ||, and ! operators are used to perform the "and", "or", and "not" operations on boolean values, respectively. The System.out.println() method is used to print the output to the console.
