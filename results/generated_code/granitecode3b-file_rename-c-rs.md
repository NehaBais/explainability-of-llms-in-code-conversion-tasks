Sure, here's the Rust code that achieves the same requirements:
```rust
use std::fs;
fn main() {
 fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").unwrap();
 fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").unwrap();
 fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt").unwrap();
 fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs").unwrap();
}
```
This code uses the `fs` module in Rust to rename files and directories. The `unwrap()` method is used to handle any errors that may occur during the renaming process.
