Here is the equivalent Java code for the Python script you provided:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        //Verify file and directory in current working directory 
        System.out.println(new File("input.txt").isFile());
        System.out.println(new File("docs").isDirectory());

        //Verify file and directory at root of filesystem   
        System.out.println(new File("/").listFiles()); //this will list all files in the root directory, you can't specifically verify a single file or directory as you do with the python script because Java's method is inherently different. 
    }
}
```
The Java `File` class provides methods to check if it exists, if its a directory or a file and also to get its last modified date etc. Please keep in mind that the syntax for paths are different between Java and Python - Java uses "/" for directories while Python automatically handles them according to the OS ("\" on Windows). However, in both scripts we're checking the same thing, whether or not a file exists at the specified path.
