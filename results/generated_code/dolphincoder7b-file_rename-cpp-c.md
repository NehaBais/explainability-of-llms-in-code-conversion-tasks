The C++ code provided is not directly compatible with the C standard library in C99 or later, as there are no equivalents of `std::rename` in the C standard library. The following conversion should be done to make it work:

1. To convert the `std::rename` function to use the C `rename` function, you can add `#include <stdlib.h>`.
2. In the line `std::rename("input.txt", "output.txt")`, change `"input.txt"` to `"input.txt"`. This is because `"input.txt"` is a string literal in C++, and in C, it's an array of characters (not a pointer), so it needs to be converted into a pointer to the first character of the string with `strerror(errno)` which will return the current error message, if any.
3. To make the code more portable, always provide a path to the file. Since you can't move a directory, I assumed the user has the rights and provided the paths as absolute paths (starting with `/`).
4. In `std::rename("/docs", "/mydocs")`, change `"/docs"` to `"docs"`, because it's not a string literal anymore, but an array of characters representing the directory name.
5. The same applies for the second rename function call `std::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")`. 
6. Lastly, you should return 0 in C, so add `return 0;` at the end of your code to indicate successful execution.

Here's the modified C code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <errno.h>

int main()
{
    if (rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", strerror(errno));
        return 1; // indicate unsuccessful execution
    }

    if (rename("docs", "mydocs") != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", strerror(errno));
        return 2; // indicate unsuccessful execution
    }

    if (rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt") != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", strerror(errno));
        return 3; // indicate unsuccessful execution
    }

    if (rename("/docs", "/mydocs") != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", strerror(errno));
        return 4; // indicate unsuccessful execution
    }

    return 0;
}
```
