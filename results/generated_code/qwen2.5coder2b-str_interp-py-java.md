Sure! Below is the equivalent Java code for the given Python code:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String extra = "little";
        String newStr = "Mary had a " + extra + " lamb.";
        System.out.println(newStr);
    }
}
```

This Java program does exactly the same thing as your Python code. It creates a string variable `extra` with the value "little", then uses string concatenation to create the new string `newStr`, which contains the interpolation of the variable into the original string. Finally, it prints the result to the console.
