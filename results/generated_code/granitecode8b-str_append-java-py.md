Here's the Python code that fulfills the given requirements:
```python
string = "abc"
print(string)
string += "def"
print(string)
```
In Python, the `+=` operator is used to concatenate two strings. So, we can simply write `string += "def"` to append the string literal `"def"` to the end of the existing string value stored in `string`. 
When you run this code, it will output:

abc
abcdef

So, the variable `string` now contains the value `"abcdef"`.
