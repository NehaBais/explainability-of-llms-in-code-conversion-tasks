Answer: The code can be converted to C++ as follows - 1) the file input.txt is renamed into output.txt with renameFile(oldname, newname). 2) The directory docs is renamed into mydocs with renameDir(oldName, newName).3) RenameFile method in Java is replaced by rename function in C++.

The converted code from java to c++:
```
#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    // The file input.txt is renamed into output.txt with renameFile(oldname, newname). 2) The directory docs is renamed into mydocs with renameDir(oldName, newName).3) RenameFile method in Java is replaced by rename function in C++.
     string oldname="input.txt";
    string newname="output.txt";
    ofstream fout("test1", ios_base::app); 
    ifstream fin ("test2");
    fout << "This file contains some sample text that can be used to test the renameFile() function"<<endl;
    
    cout << "The following file called input.txt was renamed as output.txt." << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
