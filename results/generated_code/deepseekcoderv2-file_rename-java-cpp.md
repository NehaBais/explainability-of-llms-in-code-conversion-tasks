 Sure! Below is the equivalent C++ code for the provided Java code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <filesystem>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

bool renameFile(const std::string& oldname, const std::string& newname) {
    // File (or directory) with old name
    fs::path file(oldname);
    
    // File (or directory) with new name
    fs::path file2(newname);
    
    // Rename file (or directory)
    bool success = fs::rename(file, file2);
    return success;
}

void test(const std::string& type, const std::string& oldname, const std::string& newname) {
    std::cout << "The following " << type << " called " << oldname 
              << (renameFile(oldname, newname) ? " was renamed as " : " could not be renamed into ")
              << newname << "."
              << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Test in the current working directory
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
    
    // Test in the filesystem root
    test("file", "/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    
    // Test for directories in the current working directory
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs");
    
    // Test for directories in the filesystem root
    test("directory", "/docs/", "/mydocs/");
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Namespace Alias**: We use `namespace fs = std::filesystem` to make it easier to work with the filesystem library.
2. **File Renaming**: The `renameFile` function uses `fs::rename` to rename the file or directory.
3. **Test Function**: The `test` function prints whether the renaming was successful or not.
4. **Main Function**: In the `main` function, we call the `test` function for both files and directories in both the current working directory and the filesystem root.

### Note:
- On Windows, file paths should be specified using double backslashes (`\\`) instead of a single forward slash (`/`), but since C++17, the standard library supports both formats. For simplicity, I used forward slashes in this example. If you are using an older version of C++, you might need to handle Windows paths differently.
