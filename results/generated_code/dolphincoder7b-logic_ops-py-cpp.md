This is a Python function that takes two logical (boolean) values, "a" and "b", and prints the result of "and", "or", and "not" on both arguments. In C++, we can write this as follows:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
 
void logic(bool a, bool b) {
    std::cout << "a and b: " << (a && b) << "\n";
    std::cout << "a or b: " << (a || b) << "\n";
    std::cout << "not a: " << !a << "\n";
}
 
int main() {
    logic(true, false); // call the function with boolean values
    return 0;
}
```
