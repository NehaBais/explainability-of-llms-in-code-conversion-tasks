To convert the given Java code to C++, you can use the `<fstream>` library for file operations and `<filesystem>` library for directory creation. Below is the equivalent C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <filesystem>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

int main() {
    try {
        // Create an empty file named "output.txt" in the current working directory
        std::ofstream ofs("output.txt", std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);
        if (!ofs.is_open()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create 'output.txt' in the current working directory");
        }
        ofs.close();

        // Create an empty file named "output.txt" in the filesystem root
        fs::path rootPath = "/"; // Assuming the filesystem root is '/'
        fs::ofstream ofsRoot(rootPath / "output.txt", std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);
        if (!ofsRoot.is_open()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create 'output.txt' in the filesystem root");
        }
        ofsRoot.close();

        // Create an empty directory named "docs" in the current working directory
        fs::path docsPath = "docs";
        if (!fs::create_directory(docsPath)) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create 'docs' in the current working directory");
        }

        // Create an empty directory named "docs" in the filesystem root
        fs::path docsRootPath = rootPath / "docs";
        if (!fs::create_directory(docsRootPath)) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create 'docs' in the filesystem root");
        }
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **File Creation**:
   - `std::ofstream ofs("output.txt", std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);` creates a new file named "output.txt" in the current working directory.
   - `fs::ofstream ofsRoot(rootPath / "output.txt", std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);` creates a new file named "output.txt" at the filesystem root (assumed to be '/').

2. **Directory Creation**:
   - `fs::create_directory(docsPath);` creates an empty directory named "docs" in the current working directory.
   - `fs::create_directory(docsRootPath);` creates an empty directory named "docs" at the filesystem root.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The code uses a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that might occur during file or directory creation.

### Note:
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create files and directories in the specified locations.
- On Windows, the filesystem root is usually `C:\`, so you would need to change the `rootPath` accordingly.
