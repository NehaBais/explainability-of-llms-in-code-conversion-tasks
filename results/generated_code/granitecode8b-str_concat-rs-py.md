Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task as the Rust code you provided:
```python
s = "hello"
print(s)
s1 = s + " world"
print(s1)
```
In this Python code, we first create a string variable `s` and assign it the value `"hello"`. We then print the contents of `s` to the console.
Next, we create another string variable `s1` and concatenate it with the original `s` variable and a string literal `" world"`. Finally, we print the contents of both `s` and `s1` to the console.
The output of this Python code will be:

hello
hello world

Note that in Python, we use the `+` operator to concatenate strings, just like we do in Rust. Also, in Python, we don't need to explicitly call a function to create a new string variable - we can simply assign a value to the variable directly.
