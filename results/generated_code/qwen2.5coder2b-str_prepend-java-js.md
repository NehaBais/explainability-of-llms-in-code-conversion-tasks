In JavaScript, you can convert the given Java code into the equivalent JavaScript. Here's how:

```javascript
var string = "def"; 
string = "abc" + string; 
console.log(string); // Outputs: abcdef
```

Please note that the console.log() function is used to print the variable 'string' in the browser's developer console. If you are working in an environment where JavaScript is not available, you can simply `console.log(string)` without the `console` part.
