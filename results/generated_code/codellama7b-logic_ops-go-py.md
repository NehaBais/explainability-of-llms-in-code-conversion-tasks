To convert the code from Go to Python, you can use the following format:
```
def print_logic(a, b):
  print("a and b is", a and b)
  print("a or b is", a or b)
  print("not a is", not a)
```
Note that in Python, the `and` operator has higher precedence than the `or` operator, so it is important to use parentheses to ensure that the code is evaluated correctly. Additionally, the `not` operator is used to negate a value, rather than being written as a separate function like in Go.
