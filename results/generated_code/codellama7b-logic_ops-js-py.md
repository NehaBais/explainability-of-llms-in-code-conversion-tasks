To convert this JavaScript code to Python, you can use the following code:
```
def logic(a,b):
    print(f"a AND b: {a and b}")
    print(f"a OR b: {a or b}")
    print(f"NOT a: {not a}")
```
Explanation:

1. The function `logic` takes two arguments `a` and `b`, which are of type `bool`.
2. The first line prints the result of `a && b`, which is equivalent to `a and b` in Python.
3. The second line prints the result of `a || b`, which is equivalent to `a or b` in Python.
4. The third line prints the result of `not a`, which is equivalent to `!a` in Python.
5. The function returns nothing because it doesn't have any return statement.
