The code above is a Java program that renames a file called input.txt into output.txt and a directory called docs into mydocs.
Here's how to convert it to C:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    char oldname[1024];
    char newname[1024];

    // Rename file (or directory)
    bool success = rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    printf("The following file called input.txt was renamed as output.txt %s\n", success ? "was renamed" : "could not be renamed");

    // Rename directory
    success = rename("docs", "mydocs");
    printf("The following directory called docs was renamed as mydocs %s\n", success ? "was renamed" : "could not be renamed");

    return 0;
}
```
The `main` function is a C program that renames two files, "input.txt" and "docs", into "output.txt" and "mydocs". The `rename` function is used to rename each file, which takes the old name and new name as arguments. The return value of `rename` is then checked to see if it was successful or not.
Note that in C, the `rename` function only works for files, not directories. To rename a directory in C, you need to use the `rmdir` and `mkdir` functions instead.
