This code demonstrates various string comparisons in Java, including comparing two strings for exact equality, inequality, and determining which string comes first or second in a lexicographical order. It also shows how to perform case-sensitive and case-insensitive string comparisons. Additionally, it explains how the language handles comparison of numeric strings if they are not treated lexically.

In Rust, you can use the `str` crate for string manipulation. Here's a possible implementation of the same code in Rust:
```
use str::{String, compare};

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("Hello");
    let s2 = String::from("Hello");
    let s3 = String::from("5.0");
    let s4 = String::from("Java");
    let s5 = String::from("ĴÃVÁ");
    let s6 = String::from("ĵãvá");

    // Comparing two strings for exact equality
    if s1 == s2 {
        println!("'{}' and '{}' are lexically equal.", s1, s2);
    } else {
        println!("'{}' and '{}' are not lexically equal.", s1, s2);
    }

    // Comparing two strings for inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality)
    if s1 != s2 {
        println!("'{}' and '{}' are not lexically equal.", s1, s2);
    } else {
        println!("'{}' and '{}' are lexically equal.", s1, s2);
    }

    // Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before the other
    if s3 < s4 {
        println!("'{}' is lexically before '{}'.", s3, s4);
    } else {
        println!("'{}' is not lexically before '{}'.", s3, s4);
    }

    // Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after the other
    if s5 > s6 {
        println!("'{}' is lexically after '{}'.", s5, s6);
    } else {
        println!("'{}' is not lexically after '{}'.", s5, s6);
    }

    // Comparing two strings with case-sensitive comparison
    if s1.compare(s2) == 0 {
        println!("'{}' and '{}' are case-sensitive lexically equal.", s1, s2);
    } else {
        println!("'{}' and '{}' are not case-sensitive lexically equal.", s1, s2);
    }

    // Comparing two strings with case-insensitive comparison
    if s1.compare_ignore_case(s2) == 0 {
        println!("'{}' and '{}' are case-insensitive lexically equal.", s1, s2);
    } else {
        println!("'{}' and '{}' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.", s1, s2);
    }
}
```
In Rust, string comparison is performed using the `==` and `<` operators. These operators perform a lexical comparison of the strings, which means that they compare the strings based on their Unicode code points.

The `compare` method in Rust also performs a lexical comparison of the strings, but it returns an integer value representing the relationship between the two strings. This value can be used to determine whether one string is before or after another.

The `compare_ignore_case` method in Rust performs a case-insensitive comparison of the strings, which means that it ignores the difference in case between the strings. This method returns an integer value representing the relationship between the two strings, just like the `compare` method.

In addition to these methods, Rust also provides a `cmp` method that can be used to perform lexical comparison of strings. The `cmp` method takes an optional parameter for case-sensitive or case-insensitive comparison. By default, it performs a case-sensitive comparison.

Overall, the code in Rust demonstrates various string comparisons using the `str` crate and its methods. It shows how to perform case-sensitive and case-insensitive string comparisons and how to determine whether one string is before or after another.
