The equivalent Python code to create an empty file and a directory at the current working directory and root directory is as follows:

```python
import os

# Create new files in the current working directory
with open('output.txt', 'w'): 
    pass # creates a new empty file
    
# Create new directories in the current working directory
if not os.path.exists('docs'):
    os.makedirs('docs')

# Create new files and directories at root
with open('/output.txt', 'w'): 
    pass # creates a new empty file
    
# Create new directories at root
if not os.path.exists('/docs'):
    os.makedirs('/docs')
```
In this Python code, we use the `os` library to interact with the operating system and its filesystem. It provides functions such as `open()` for file creation, and `os.path.exists()` to check if a file or directory exists. The statement `with open('output.txt', 'w'): pass` is used to create an empty text file named "output.txt".
The function `os.makedirs()` creates directories recursively (i.e., it will create missing parent directories as needed). 
Please note that you might need to run this Python script with root privileges or adjust your system's permissions accordingly, especially for creating files/directories at the filesystem root directory.
