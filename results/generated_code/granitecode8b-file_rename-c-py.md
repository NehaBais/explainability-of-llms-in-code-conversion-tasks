Here is the code converted from C to Python:
```
import os
# Rename a file in the current working directory
os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
# Rename a file in the filesystem root
os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
```
This code uses the `os` module in Python to rename files and directories. The `os.rename()` function takes two arguments: the current name of the file or directory and the new name. In this case, we are renaming "input.txt" to "output.txt", "docs" to "mydocs", "/input.txt" to "/output.txt", and "/docs" to "/mydocs".
