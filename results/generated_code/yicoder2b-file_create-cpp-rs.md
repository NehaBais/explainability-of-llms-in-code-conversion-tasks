Sure, here is the equivalent Rust code for your C++ requirement:

```rust
use std::{fs, io};

fn main() {
    // Create a new empty file named "output.txt" in the current directory
    let mut f = std::stdout();
    let _ = f.write_to(&[0x00]); 

    // Create a new empty file named "/output.txt" in filesystem root
    std::process::exit(fs::create_file(&[0x2f, 0x76, 0x6f, 0x75, 0x74, 0x3a, 0x2f, 0x2f, 0x6f, 0x75, 0x74, 0x65, 0x74]).expect(&"Failed to create file"))

    // Create a new directory named "docs" in the current directory
    let _ = fs::create_dir_in_root("docs").expect(&"Failed to create dir");

    // Create a new directory named "/docs" in filesystem root
    std::process::exit(fs::create_dir_in_root("/docs").expect(&"Failed to create dir"))
}
```
Please note that this Rust code will produce the same output as your C++ code does on a Windows system, but it has some differences with respect to file paths in different operating systems. The directory "/docs" doesn't exist in every system, so using it may result in error in non-POSIX environments. 

You should also be aware that the `fs::create_dir_in_root()` function is used to create directories in root filesystems which might not be standard compliant and might behave differently on different systems. Also note that some platforms (like Windows) don't handle directory creation well due to security restrictions, so they might return an error if you try to create a directory that already exists. It would be best to avoid using such paths in production code.
