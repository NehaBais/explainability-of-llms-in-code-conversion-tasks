Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Python code:

```javascript
let s1 = "hello";
console.log(s1 + " world");

let s2 = s1 + " world";
console.log(s2);

let arr = ["hello", "world", "mom"];
s1 = arr.join(", ");
console.log(s1);

s2 = arr.join(", ");
console.log(s2);
```
This code works similarly to your Python code. `let s1`, `let s2`, and `let arr` are equivalent to the Python variables of the same names. JavaScript uses let for variable declaration, similar to Python's `def`.

The JavaScript console.log function is equivalent to Python's print statement. In JavaScript, the plus (+) operator is used for concatenation just like it is in Python. 

Array join method works similarly to the `join` in Python. It takes a separator as an argument and joins all elements of an array into one string separated by that separator.
