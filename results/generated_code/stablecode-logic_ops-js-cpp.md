Below is the equivalent C++ code for the given JavaScript function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void logic(bool a, bool b) {

    cout << "a AND b: " << (a && b) << endl;
    cout << "a OR b: " << (a || b) << endl;
    cout << "NOT a: " << (!a) << endl;
}
```
In this C++ code, the function 'logic' takes two boolean values as input. Then it prints out different logical operations on these two arguments - AND, OR and NOT. The result of each operation is printed to the console using 'cout'.
