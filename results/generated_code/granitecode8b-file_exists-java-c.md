Here is the converted code from Java to C that verifies if files and directories exist:
```c
#include 
int main() {
 // Verifying if a file called input.txt and a directory called docs exist in the current working directory
 if (access("docs/input.txt", F_OK) != -1) {
 printf("File and directory exists in the current working directoryn");
 } else {
 printf("File or directory does not exist in the current working directoryn");
 }
 
 // Verifying if a file called input.txt and a directory called docs exist in the filesystem root
 if (access("/docs/input.txt", F_OK) != -1) {
 printf("File and directory exists in the filesystem rootn");
 } else {
 printf("File or directory does not exist in the filesystem rootn");
 }
 
 return 0;
}
```
The `access()` function is used to check if a file or directory exists. The second argument of this function specifies the type of access to check for, and `F_OK` indicates that only the existence of the file or directory should be checked. If the file or directory exists, `access()` returns 0. If it does not exist, it returns -1.
