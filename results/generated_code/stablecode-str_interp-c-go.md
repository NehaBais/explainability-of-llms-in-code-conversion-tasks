Here is the equivalent code in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    // Define variable with specific value
    extra := "little"

    // Use string interpolation (formatted string literal)
    fmt.Printf("Mary had a %s lamb.\n", extra))
}
```
The code performs the same operations as in C. It defines a `extra` variable and assigns it the value `"little"`. Then, it uses formatted string literals to perform string interpolation. The format specifier `%s` is used to insert the value of the `extra` variable into the string.
