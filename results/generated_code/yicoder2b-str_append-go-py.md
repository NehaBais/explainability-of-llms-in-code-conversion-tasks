Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for the given GoLang code.

```python
def main():
    s = 'foo'
    s += 'bar'
    print(s)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
In this Python version of the code, we define a string variable `s` and immediately append the strings "foo" and "bar" to it in a single line. The `+=` operator is used for string concatenation in Python as well. We then print out the contents of `s`.
