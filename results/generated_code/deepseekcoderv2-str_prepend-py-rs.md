Answer: In Python, you can use the string method `ljust` to prepend a string with another string literal. Here's the code in Rust:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("12345678");
    s = "0".to_string().add(&s);
    println!("{}", s);
}
```
In Rust, the `String` type is used to store a string of characters. The method `.add` takes two strings and returns their concatenation as a new string. In this case, we use the literal "0" as the first argument and the variable `s` as the second argument.
The result is printed to the console using the println! macro from the standard library.
