In C++, the equivalent code would be:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string s = "foo";
    s += "bar";
    std::cout << s << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In C++, you can directly append a string to another using the `+=` operator. The appended result is then printed out with `std::cout`.
