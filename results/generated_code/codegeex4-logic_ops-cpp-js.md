Here's how you can convert the given C++ code to JavaScript:

```javascript
function print_logic(a, b) {
  console.log(`a and b is ${a && b}`);
  console.log(`a or b is ${a || b}`);
  console.log(`not a is ${!a}`);
}
```

This JavaScript function does exactly what the original C++ code does: it accepts two boolean arguments (`a` and `b`) and logs to the console the result of "and", "or" on both arguments, and "not" on the first argument.
