 Below is the equivalent code in C that demonstrates the same functionalities as the provided Java code, including string comparisons for exact equality, inequality, and both case sensitive and insensitive comparisons, as well as handling numeric strings.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>

void compare(char *A, char *B) {
    if (strcmp(A, B) == 0)
        printf("'%s' and '%s' are lexically equal.\n", A, B);
    else
        printf("'%s' and '%s' are not lexically equal.\n", A, B);

    // Convert strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    char lowerA[256], lowerB[256];
    int i;
    for (i = 0; A[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        lowerA[i] = tolower(A[i]);
    }
    lowerA[i] = '\0';
    for (i = 0; B[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        lowerB[i] = tolower(B[i]);
    }
    lowerB[i] = '\0';

    if (strcmp(lowerA, lowerB) == 0)
        printf("'%s' and '%s' are case-insensitive lexically equal.\n", A, B);
    else
        printf("'%s' and '%s' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.\n", A, B);

    if (strcmp(A, B) < 0)
        printf("'%s' is lexically before '%s'.\n", A, B);
    else if (strcmp(A, B) > 0)
        printf("'%s' is lexically after '%s'.\n", A, B);

    if (strcmp(A, B) >= 0)
        printf("'%s' is not lexically before '%s'.\n", A, B);
    if (strcmp(A, B) <= 0)
        printf("'%s' is not lexically after '%s'.\n", A, B);

    int comparison = strcmp(A, B);
    printf("The lexical relationship is: %d\n", comparison);

    int caseInsensitiveComparison = strcasecmp(A, B);
    printf("The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: %d\n", caseInsensitiveComparison);
}

int main() {
    compare("Hello", "Hello");
    compare("5", "5.0");
    compare("java", "Java");
    compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ");
    compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĵãvá");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Exact Equality and Inequality**: The `strcmp` function is used to compare strings for exact equality, and the result is checked using conditional statements. For case-insensitive comparison, we convert both strings to lowercase using a loop and then use `strcasecmp`.
2. **Lexical Order Comparison**: Using `strcmp`, we determine if one string is lexically before or after another. The results are printed based on the comparison outcome.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: For case-insensitive comparisons, both strings are converted to lowercase using a loop and then compared with `strcasecmp`.
4. **Numeric String Handling**: When comparing numeric strings that should be treated lexically, the default string comparison behavior in C will handle them correctly since it compares character by character until one is greater or smaller.
5. **Other Comparisons**: The code demonstrates basic string comparisons available in both Java and C, including exact equality, inequality, lexical order, and case-insensitive order comparisons.
