Here's the Python code that performs bitwise operations on two integers, a and b:
```python
a = 10 # replace with your desired integer values
b = 5 # replace with your desired integer values
print("a & b:", a & b)
print("a | b:", a | b)
print("a ^ b:", a ^ b)
print("~a:", ~a)
print("a << n:", a << b) # left shift
print("a >> n:", a >> b) # arithmetic right shift
c = a & 0xffffffff # convert to unsigned integer for logical shift
print("c >> b:", c >> b) # logical right shift
# there are no rotation operators in Python, so we'll have to use bitwise operations instead
# left rotate: (a << b) | (a >> (32 - b))
d = (a << b) | (a >> (32 - b))
print("d:", d)
# right rotate: (a >> b) | (a << (32 - b))
e = (a >> b) | (a << (32 - b))
print("e:", e)
``` 
Note that in Python, the bitwise operators are different from C. The `&` operator performs a bitwise AND, the `|` operator performs a bitwise OR, and the `^` operator performs a bitwise XOR. The `~` operator performs a bitwise NOT on the integer. To perform left shift, use the `<<` operator, and to perform arithmetic right shift (on most platforms), use the `>>` operator. For logical right shift (on 32-bit integers), you can use the `>>` operator on an unsigned integer.
To perform a left rotate, we can use the bitwise OR operator to combine the shifted bits from the left and right sides of the integer. To perform a right rotate, we can use the bitwise OR operator to combine the shifted bits from the right and left sides of the integer. In both cases, we'll need to use the modulo operator (`%`) to ensure that the shift amount is within the range of 0 to 31.
