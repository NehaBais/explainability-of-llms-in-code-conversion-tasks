In JavaScript, you can use the `+=` operator to concatenate strings together. Here is how you would convert the Java code into JavaScript:

```javascript
public class strAppend {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        let string = "abc";
        console.log(string);
        string += "def";
        console.log(string);
    }
}
```

This will produce the same output as the original Java code.
