Sure, the code you provided is in Python and it is meant to rename a file from input.txt to output.txt and a directory from docs to mydocs at both the current working directory (here) and filesystem root. 

Here's how it could be converted into C:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    // Rename here file from input.txt to output.txt
    rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    
    // Directory rename from docs to mydocs in current working directory (here)
    if (rename("docs", "mydocs")) {
        perror("Error renaming current directory docs");
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Directory rename from docs to mydocs in filesystem root (/mydocs)
    if (rename("/" "mydocs")) {
        perror("Error renaming filesystem root docs");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This program uses the `stdio.h` library for input and output operations, specifically the `rename()` function to rename files or directories. The `perror()` function is used to print the error message if any occurred while renaming a directory. It should be noted that filesystem root usually requires administrative privileges due to security reasons.

Please note that you need execute permissions for the `/` command on some Unix-like operating systems.
