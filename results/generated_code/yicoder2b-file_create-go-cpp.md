The provided Golang code creates a new file and directory with the given names in the current working directory and filesystem root respectively. However, since C++ does not have the equivalent functionality for creating files or directories like Golang's os.Create() or os.Mkdir(), I can provide a similar logic using C++ standard library functions.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void createFile(const string& fn) {
    ofstream f(fn, ios::out | ios::trunc); // open for writing with truncation (creating if necessary)
    if (!f.good())
        cout << "Error creating file: " << fn << endl;
    else {
        cout << "File " << fn << " created!" << endl;
        f.close();  // close the stream, so that it flushes the buffer and doesn't have to be reopened with each write
    }
}

void createDir(const string& dn) {
    if (mkdir(dn.c_str(), 0755) == 0)  // mkdir returns 0 on success
        cout << "Directory " << dn << " created!" << endl;
    else
        cout << "Error creating directory: " << dn << endl;
}

int main() {
    createFile("input.txt");  // create file in current working directory
    createDir("docs");       // create directory in current working directory
    createFile("/newfile.txt");  // create file in root filesystem
    createDir("/newdir");     // create directory in root filesystem
}
```
Please note that this code doesn't check for errors like the original Golang version does and it doesn't close the file streams. The streams will have remaining data when you call createFile or createDir again, so it might not behave as expected if you plan to write into them. If you want to write into a file or directory, you should open it with ios::out | ios::trunc flag and then write into it until you close the stream.
