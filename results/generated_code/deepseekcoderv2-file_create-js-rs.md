Answer: 
To convert the JavaScript code to Rust, we will use the std::fs module from the Rust standard library. Here is a translation of the given code in Rust:

Rust:
```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    fs::write("output.txt", "").unwrap();
    fs::write("/output.txt", "").unwrap();
    
    fs::create_dir("docs").unwrap();
    fs::create_dir("/docs").unwrap();
}
```

This Rust code should create an empty file called "output.txt" in both the current directory and the filesystem root, as well as creating a new directory named "docs" in the same location. If any errors occur during this process, they will be handled by the unwrap_or_default method of Result<T, E>, which returns an Err(e) variant with information about the error if an operation fails, or else returns Ok(value).
