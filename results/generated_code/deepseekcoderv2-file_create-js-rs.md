 To convert the given JavaScript code to Rust, we need to use the `std::fs` module for file and directory operations. Here is the equivalent Rust code:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Function to handle errors
    fn fct(err: std::io::Result<()>) {
        if let Err(e) = err {
            eprintln!("{}", e);
        }
    }

    // Create file in the current working directory
    fs::write("output.txt", "").map_err(fct).unwrap();

    // Create file in the root directory (assuming Unix-like filesystem)
    fs::write("/output.txt", "").map_err(fct).unwrap();

    // Create directory in the current working directory
    fs::create_dir("docs").map_err(fct).unwrap();

    // Create directory in the root directory (assuming Unix-like filesystem)
    fs::create_dir("/docs").map_err(fct).unwrap();
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function `fct`**: This function takes a result of an I/O operation and prints any error that occurs.
2. **Creating Files**: 
   - `fs::write("output.txt", "")` creates or overwrites the file "output.txt" with empty content. The `map_err(fct)` method is used to pass errors to our custom function, and `unwrap()` ensures that any error will be printed.
   - `fs::write("/output.txt", "")` attempts to create a file in the root directory. This might not work depending on your filesystem permissions or environment.
3. **Creating Directories**: 
   - `fs::create_dir("docs")` creates a new directory named "docs" in the current working directory.
   - `fs::create_dir("/docs")` attempts to create a directory in the root directory. This might not work depending on your filesystem permissions or environment.

### Note:
- On Unix-like systems, attempting to write to or create files/directories in the root directory (`/`) typically requires superuser privileges. If you run into permission issues, consider running the program with elevated privileges or using a different path that does not require root access.
