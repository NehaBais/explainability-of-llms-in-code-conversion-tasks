 Certainly! Below is the Rust code that performs string interpolation similar to the given C code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let extra = "little";
    println!("Mary had a {} lamb.", extra);
}
```

In this Rust code, we define a variable `extra` with the value `"little"` and use the `println!` macro to perform string interpolation. The placeholder `{}` is replaced by the value of `extra`.
