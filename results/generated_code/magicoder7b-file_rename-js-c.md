 This problem can't be solved directly in C because the code you gave is written in JavaScript and uses ActiveXObject, which is not available or accessible in C as it doesn't have built-in support for file system operations.

C doesn't provide a direct equivalent for `ActiveXObject`, which is used to interact with Windows OS features like file I/O. Also, C doesn't support string paths that start with a slash (`/`), so you can't use the full path of a file starting from root in the same way as JavaScript does.

If your goal was to rename files and directories using system commands or libraries, then here is an example:

### With System Commands (Unix)
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    // Rename file in the current directory.
    if(rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0){
        perror("Failed to rename input.txt");
    }
    
    // Rename file in root directory
    if (rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt") != 0) {
        perror("Failed to rename /input.txt");
    }

    // Rename folder in the current directory
    if(rename("docs", "mydocs") != 0){
       perror("Failed to rename docs");
    }
    
    // Rename folder in root directory
    if (rename("/docs", "/mydocs") != 0) {
        perror("Failed to rename /docs");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### With Library (Windows)

#include <windows.h>

int main() {
    // Rename file in the current directory
    if (!MoveFileA("input.txt", "output.txt")) {
        printf("Failed to rename input.txt: %d\n", GetLastError());
    }
    
    // Rename file in root directory
    if (!MoveFileA("C:\\input.txt", "C:\\output.txt")) {
       printf("Failed to rename C:\\input.txt: %d\n", GetLastError());
    }
    
    // Rename folder in the current directory
    if(!MoveFileExA("docs", MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT, NULL)){
        printf("Failed to rename docs: %d\n", GetLastError());
    }
    
    // Rename folder in root directory
    if (!MoveFileExA("C:\\docs", MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT, NULL)) {
       printf("Failed to rename C:\\docs: %d\n", GetLastError());
    }
    
    return 0;
}

Please note that the above code needs to be run with appropriate permissions and does not handle errors gracefully. Also, please consider the impact of running these commands as administrative privileges may be required to move or delete system files/directories in some cases.
