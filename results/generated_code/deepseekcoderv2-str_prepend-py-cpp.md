Answer: Here is the C++ code that converts the given Python code into its equivalent form in C++. The modified code includes the necessary modifications to use a string literal for `s` and prepend it with another string literal. Additionally, the variable names are changed to conform to C++ naming conventions (`my_string_variable` instead of `s`).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string my_string_variable = "0"; // Create a new string variable called my_string_variable and assign it the value '0'
    cout << (my_string_variable + "12345678") << endl; // Prepend the string literal to the existing string.

    return 0;
}
```
In this code, we create a new `std::string` variable named `my_string_variable`, assign it the value '0' (with single quotes), and then concatenate it with another string literal ("12345678") using the + operator. The result is printed to the console using `std::cout`.
