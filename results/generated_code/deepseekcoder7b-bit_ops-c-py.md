In Python, bitwise operations can be performed using the `&` operator for AND, `|` for OR, and `^` for XOR. The equivalent of a NOT operation is to use `~` but in python it's not directly possible like C. But we could emulate it by calculating the one's complement of the number which can be achieved using Python built-in function `bin()` and slicing. Bitwise shift operations are performed using the `<<` for left shift, and `>>` for right shift.

Here is how you would write this code in python:
```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    print("a and b:", a & b)
    print("a or b:", a | b)
    print("a xor b:", a ^ b)
    
    # Python equivalent of bitwise NOT operator 
    print("not a (Python's workaround):", ~a + (1 << 32))
    
    print("a << n:", a << b)  # left shift
    print("a >> n:", a >> b)  # arithmetic right shift
    
    c = a & 0xFFFFFFFF  # convert to unsigned int for logical right shift
    print("c >> n:", c >> b)   # logical right shift

def rotate(a, b):
    print("Left rotate:", (a << b) | (a >> 32-b))   # left rotate
    print("Right rotate:", (a >> b) | (a << 32-b))  # right rotate
```
This code snippet will work for a 32 bit integer on Python, but it may not be portable to different platforms or architectures as C. If you need this solution in a specific language then please specify the platform and architecture.
