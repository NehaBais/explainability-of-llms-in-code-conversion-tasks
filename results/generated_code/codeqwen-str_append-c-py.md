The equivalent code in Python would be:

```python
# Creating a string variable equal to any text value.
str = "Good Morning"

# Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way.
str += " to All" + " !!!"

# Show the contents of the variable after the append operation.
print(str)
```

In Python, we use the `+=` operator to concatenate strings. This is an idiomatic way to perform string appending in Python as compared to C where we need to manually calculate the space required and then use `sprintf`.
