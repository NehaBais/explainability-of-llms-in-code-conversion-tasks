The equivalent JavaScript code for the given Java code would be:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Verify the size of a file called input.txt for a file in the current working directory, and another one in the file system root.
let filePath1 = './file.txt';
let filePath2 = '/file.txt';

try {
    let stats1 = fs.statSync(filePath1);
    console.log(stats1.size + ' B');

    let stats2 = fs.statSync(filePath2);
    console.log(stats2.size + ' B');
} catch (err) {
  // handle error
  console.error(err);
}
```
Please note that in the JavaScript code, `fs.statSync()` function is used to get information about a file synchronously (this means it will block the program until it gets done), and `stats.size` gives the size of the file in bytes. The path for the files are provided as strings ('filePath1' and 'filePath2'). 

We also use a try/catch block to catch any errors that may occur when trying to read the file.
