Here's the converted code in C++:
```
std::string string = "def";
string = "abc" + string;
```
In this code, we first declare a string variable called `string` and initialize it with the value `"def"`. Then, we concatenate the string literal `"abc"` with the existing value of `string` using the `+` operator. The resulting string is assigned back to the `string` variable.
