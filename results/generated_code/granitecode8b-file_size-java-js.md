Here's the JavaScript code that verifies the size of a file called input.txt for a file in the current working directory and another one in the file system root:
```
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const filePath1 = 'input.txt';
const filePath2 = '/input.txt';
try {
 const stats1 = fs.statSync(path.join(__dirname, filePath1));
 console.log(`File size of ${filePath1} in bytes: ${stats1.size}`);
 
 const stats2 = fs.statSync(filePath2);
 console.log(`File size of ${filePath2} in bytes: ${stats2.size}`);
} catch (err) {
 console.error('Error accessing file:', err);
}
```
Note that the code above uses the `fs` module to access the file system and the `path` module to construct file paths. The `__dirname` variable is used to get the current working directory. If you run this code in a different directory, make sure to replace `input.txt` with the name of your file.
