To convert the JavaScript code to Python, you can use the `os` module for file and directory operations. The following is the equivalent of the JavaScript code in Python:

```python
import os

# Create a FileSystemObject object
fso = os.environ['PYTHONIOENCODING']

# Define the source files and directories
source_files = ['input.txt', 'docs']
target_files = ['output.txt', 'mydocs']
source_dirs = ['c:/input.txt', 'c:/docs']
target_dirs = ['c:/mydocs']

# Move each file to the target location
for src_file, tgt_file in zip(source_files, target_files):
    os.rename(src_file, tgt_file)

# Change directory if necessary (not required in this case)
os.chdir('.')

# Move each directory to the target location
for src_dir, tgt_dir in zip(source_dirs, target_dirs):
    os.rename(src_dir, tgt_dir)
```

This Python script uses `os` functions such as `rename`, `cd`, and `mkdir`. The `os.environ['PYTHONIOENCODING']` is assumed to be set for Windows. It moves each file and directory listed in the variables to the corresponding target location using the `os.rename` function. The directories are moved without changing their names, as they do not need to be renamed.
