The following is the conversion of the Java code to Go: 

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := "def"
	s = "abc" + s
	fmt.Println(s)
}
```
This will create a string variable called s and assign it the value of the string "def." After that, it appends the string "abc" to the end of the s variable and prints it.
