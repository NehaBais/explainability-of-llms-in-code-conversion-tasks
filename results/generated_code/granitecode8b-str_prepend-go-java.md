Here's the converted code in Java:
```
String s = "world!";
s = "Hello, " + s;
```
In this code, we first declare a string variable `s` and assign it the value `"world!"`. Then we prepend the string variable with another string literal by concatenating it with the existing value of `s` using the `+` operator. The resulting string is `"Hello, world!"`.
