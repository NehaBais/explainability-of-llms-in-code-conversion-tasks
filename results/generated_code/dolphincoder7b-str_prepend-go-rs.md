Rust does not support multiple assignment or shorthand for concatenation as in Python. In Rust, you can use string formatting to achieve the desired result. Here's how it would look like:

```rust
let mut s = "world!".to_string();
s = format!("Hello, {}", &s);
println!("{}", s);
```

This code sets `s` to a mutable variable with an initial value of the string literal "world!" using the `to_string()` method. Then it uses string formatting (`{}`) to concatenate the string literals and the value of the `s` variable, resulting in the final output: "Hello, world!".

The `&` symbol indicates that we are passing a reference to the `s` variable. This way, the value of `s` is not copied, which can lead to performance benefits in large-scale applications.
