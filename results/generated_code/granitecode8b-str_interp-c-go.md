Here's the equivalent code in Golang:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
 extra := "big"
 fmt.Printf("Mary had a %s lamb.n", extra)
}
```
The `extra` variable is defined and assigned a value of `"big"`. The `%s` in the `Printf()` function is a placeholder for a string value, which is then replaced with the value of the `extra` variable. The `fmt.Printf()` function prints the resulting string to the console.
