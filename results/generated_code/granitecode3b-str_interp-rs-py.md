Here's the Python code that performs string interpolation using the same approach as in the Rust code:
```
name = "Mary"
adj = "big"
print(f"{name} had a {adj} lamb")
```
This code first defines two variables, `name` and `adj`, with values "Mary" and "big", respectively. It then uses f-strings to perform string interpolation in the print statements. The curly braces indicate that the enclosed expression should be evaluated as a variable or value. The {} characters are replaced by their corresponding values.
