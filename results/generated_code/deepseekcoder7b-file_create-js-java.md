Java does not have a built-in file system like JavaScript so we would use `Files` and `Paths` classes from Java `java.nio.file` package to achieve the same result in Java. Here is how you can do it:

Please note that, java has no concept of 'root' directory as Unix/Linux systems have '/' as root. On windows machines, it will be something like C:\ as your filesystem starts from there and we cannot create files or directories at the root level in java.
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path path1 = Paths.get(".", "output.txt"); 
        Files.write(path1, "".getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.CREATE);
  
        // Assuming the file system root to be '/' for simplicity
        // In reality you cannot write files at root level in java as it is not possible on Unix/Linux systems
        Path path2 = Paths.get("/", "output.txt"); 
        Files.write(path2, "".getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.CREATE);
  
        Path dir1 = Paths.get(".", "docs");
        Files.createDirectories(dir1);

        Path dir2 = Paths<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>.get("/", "docs");
        Files.createDirectories(dir2);
    }
}
```
This code will create 'output.txt' file and 'docs' directory in the current working directory (.) then creates same named files at root level(/) of filesystem, but it won't work as you expect on a typical Windows system because the root is actually something like C:\ on windows.

If you really want to create directories or files at root level (in Unix/Linux systems), you will have to execute this java code from console with super user privileges because '/' starts filesystem hierarchy in unix-like systems and thus can be created as a directory by the current process.
