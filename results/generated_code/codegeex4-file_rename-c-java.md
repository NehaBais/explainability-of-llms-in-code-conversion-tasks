Below is the Java equivalent of your C code. Please note that in order to execute these operations, you need sufficient permissions and these methods could throw an IOException.

```java
import java.io.File;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        renameFilesInDirectory(new File("."));
        renameFilesInDirectory(new File("/"));
    }

    private static void renameFilesInDirectory(File directory) throws Exception {
        // Rename input.txt to output.txt
        File inputFile = new File(directory, "input.txt");
        File outputFile = new File(directory, "output.txt");

        if (inputFile.exists()) {
            boolean success = inputFile.renameTo(outputFile);
            if (!success)
                throw new Exception("Failed to rename file: " + inputFile.getPath());
        }

        // Rename docs directory to mydocs
        File docsDirectory = new File(directory, "docs");
        File myDocsDirectory = new File(directory, "mydocs");

        if (docsDirectory.exists()) {
            boolean success = docsDirectory.renameTo(myDocsDirectory);
            if (!success)
                throw new Exception("Failed to rename directory: " + docsDirectory.getPath());
        }
    }
}
```

This code basically does the following:
- It defines a `renameFilesInDirectory` method that attempts to rename files and directories in the given directory.
- In the main method, it calls this method twice once with "." (the current working directory) and again with "/" (the filesystem root). This assumes you have the necessary permissions to access these directories. If not, an exception will be thrown.
