 In Python, the bitwise operations are performed using the '&', '|', and '^' operators and the '~' operator for bitwise NOT. Bitwise shifts can be done with the '<<' and '>>' operators respectively. For rotation operations, we have inbuilt functions like '*' and '/' which can be used to perform rotations. 
Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    print("a AND b: ", a & b)
    print("a OR b: ", a | b)
    print("a XOR b: ", a ^ b)
    print("NOT a: ", ~a)
    print("a << b: ", a << b)  # left shift
    print("a >> b: ", a >> b)  # arithmetic right shift
    print("a & (a >> b): ", a & (a >> b))  # logical right shift
    print(f"a rotr {b}: ", ((a * (31 % b)) | (a >> b))) # rotate right, Python doesn't have a built in function for this so we use a combination of '*' and '/' operators to emulate it.
    print(f"a rotl {b}: ", ((a << (b & 0x1F)) | (a >> (32 - b)))) # rotate left, Python doesn't have a built in function for this so we use a combination of '<<' and '>>' operators to emulate it.
```
Note: The function "Integer.rotateLeft" or "Integer.rotateRight" are not available in Python because unlike Java, Python does not have a built-in function for bitwise rotation operations on integers. Also, the right shift operation in Python is arithmetic by default but we can make it logical by using '>>>' operator instead of '>>'.
