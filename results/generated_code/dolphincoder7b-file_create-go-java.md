```java
import java.io.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        new File("output.txt").createNewFile();
        new File("/output.txt").createNewFile();
        new File("docs/").mkdirs(); // If directory does not exist, create it
        new File("/docs/").mkdirs();   // Create a directory in the root
    }
}
```
The above Java code creates an empty file "output.txt" and an empty directory "docs", twice: once in the current working directory and once at the filesystem root. The `createNewFile()` method is used to create new files, while `mkdirs()` method can be used to create a directory if it doesn't exist. If the `mkdirs()` method fails because the parent directories don't exist, an exception will be thrown.
Note: In Java 7 and higher versions, there's no need for separate try/catch blocks; the exceptions are propagated up the call stack which is handled by the main function itself.
