The equivalent Java code to perform the same task as your provided C++ code would be:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Rename a file in current working directory.
        File currentDirectory = new File("."));
        File inputFile = new File(currentDirectory, "input.txt"));
        File outputFile = new File(currentDirectory, "output.txt"));
        inputFile.renameTo(outputFile);

        // Rename a directory in the filesystem root.
        File rootDirectory = new File("/");
        File docsDirectory = new File(rootDirectory, "docs"));
        File mydocsDirectory = new File(rootDirectory, "mydocs"));
        docsDirectory.renameTo(mymdocsDirectory);
      }
}
```
This Java code is a direct conversion of the C++ code you provided, which renames files in the current working directory and renames directories in the filesystem root.
Please make sure to run this code with appropriate permissions on your filesystem.
