Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given Java code:

```javascript
function compare(A, B) {
    if (A === B)
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are lexically equal.`);
    else
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not lexically equal.`);

    if (A.localeCompare(B) === 0)
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are case-insensitive lexically equal.`);
    else
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.`);

    if (A.localeCompare(B) < 0)
        console.log(`'${A}' is lexically before '${B}'.`);
    else if (A.localeCompare(B) > 0)
        console.log(`'${A}' is lexically after '${B}'.`);

    if (A.localeCompare(B) >= 0)
        console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically before '${B}'.`);
    if (A.localeCompare(B) <= 0)
        console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically after '${B}'.`); 

    console.log(`The lexical relationship is: ${A.localeCompare(B)} 
The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: ${A.localeCompare(B, 'en-US', { sensitivity: 'base' })}`);
}
```

As mentioned earlier, JavaScript does not have built-in method for performing a numeric string comparison. Hence the use of `localeCompare` function with specific locale (in this case 'en-US') and `sensitivity` parameter set to 'base'. If you want to compare two numeric strings as they would be treated as numbers rather than lexically, the code needs to be modified as follows:

function compare(A, B) {
    if (+A === +B)
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are lexically equal.`);
    else
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not lexically equal.`);

    if (A.localeCompare(B, 'en-US', { sensitivity: 'base' }) === 0)
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are case-insensitive lexically equal.`);
    else
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.`);

    if (+A < +B)
        console.log(`'${A}' is lexically before '${B}'.`);
    else if (+A > +B)
        console.log(`'${A}' is lexically after '${B}'.`);

    if (+A >= +B)
        console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically before '${B}'.`);
    if (+A <= +B)
        console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically after '${B}'.`); 

    console.log(`The lexical relationship is: ${+A - +B}
The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: ${+A - +B}`);
}

This modified code will compare two numeric strings as numbers rather than lexically.
