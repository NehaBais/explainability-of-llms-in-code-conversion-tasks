The provided Rust code is to rename a file called "input.txt" into an output file called "output.txt" and a directory called "docs" into another directory called "mydocs". This operation can be performed in both the current working directory and filesystem root.

Unfortunately, it's important to note that Rust doesn't have built-in functionality for performing filesystem operations directly on the root of the file system like "/input.txt" or "/output.txt" do. The operations are done via the std::fs crate which is a standard library crate providing access to the standard filesystem functions.

Here's how you can convert this Rust code into C++:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void rename_files(const char* old_name, const char* new_name) {
    if (rename(old_name, new_name) == 0) {
        printf("File renamed successfully\n");
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to rename file: %s\n", strerror(errno));
    }
}

int main() {
    rename_files("input.txt", "output.txt");
    struct stat st;
    if (stat("docs", &st) == 0 && S_ISDIR(st.st_mode)) {
        rename_files("docs", "mydocs");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code works in a similar way to the Rust version. It defines a function `rename_files` which takes two names as arguments and attempts to rename them. If the operation is successful, it prints a success message. If an error occurs, it prints out the error message. The `main` function tries to rename "input.txt" into "output.txt". If this fails (as indicated by its return value being non-zero), it then checks if the file at "docs" exists and is a directory. If so, it renames "docs" into "mydocs". This should replicate the operation performed in the Rust version on the filesystem root.
