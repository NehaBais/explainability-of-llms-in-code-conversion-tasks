The Python version of the code would look like this:

```python
my_strings = ["prepended to", "my string"]
prepended = ''.join(my_strings)
print(prepended)
```
In Python, you can directly join strings in a list using the `join()` method. This is much more straightforward than accumulating all elements of a vector or other iterable type (which do not exist in Python).
