Here is the equivalent code in Golang:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := "hello"

	fmt.Println(s)

	s1 := s + " world"

	fmt.Println(s1)
}
```
This Golang code does exactly the same as the provided Rust code. It declares a string variable `s` and initializes it with the string literal "hello". The content of `s` is then printed to the console. Next, another string variable `s1` is declared and initialized with the concatenation of `s` and the string literal " world". The content of `s1` is then printed to the console.
