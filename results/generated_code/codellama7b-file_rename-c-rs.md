This code will not work as is in Rust because Rust does not have a `rename` function in the standard library. In order to achieve this functionality, you can use the `std::fs::rename` function from the `std::fs` module.

Here is an example of how you could modify the code to work in Rust:
```
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs");
    fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
}
```
This code will perform the same actions as the original C code, but it is written in Rust syntax and uses the `std::fs` module to perform the file operations.

Keep in mind that this is just an example of how you could modify the code, and you may need to adjust it depending on your specific use case.
