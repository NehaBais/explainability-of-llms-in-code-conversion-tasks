Here's the equivalent code in Rust:
```
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
 println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
 println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
 println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
``` 
Note that in Rust, function names are lowercase by convention, so I changed the function name to `print_logic`. Also, the curly braces are used for block delimiters instead of `fmt.Println`, and I added some spaces for readability.
