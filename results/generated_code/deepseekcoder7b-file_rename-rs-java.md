The Java equivalent of the provided Rust code is as follows. It requires java.nio.file package to work with file system:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Path sourcePath = null; 
        Path targetPath = null;
        
        try{            
            // Rename file "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the current directory
            sourcePath = Paths.get("./input.txt");
            targetPath = Paths<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>.get("./output.txt");
            Files.move(sourcePath, targetPath, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING); 
            
            // Rename dir "docs" to "mydocs" in the current directory
            sourcePath = Paths.get("./docs");
            targetPath = Paths.get("./mydocs");
            Files.move(sourcePath, targetPath, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);   
            
            // Rename file "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the root directory
            sourcePath = Paths.get("/input.txt");
            targetPath = Paths.get("/output.txt");
            Files.move(sourcePath, targetPath, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING); 
            
            // Rename dir "docs" to "mydocs" in the root directory
            sourcePath = Paths.get("/docs");
            targetPath = Paths.get("/mydocs");
            Files.move(sourcePath, targetPath, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>_EXISTING); 
        }catch (IOException e) {
           System.out.println("File move error"); 
       }
    }
}
```

Please replace 's' in `StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING` with an actual string, I had to replace it as you can not use variables inside string directly like this in Java. The variable should be defined separately but since the error handling seems to indicate that we are replacing already existing files and directories every time, I assumed 's' is meant for StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING. 

Please note: `Files.move()` does not throw an exception if the source file/directory doesn’t exist or if you don’t have permission to move it. If this could cause problems in your code, you might want to check beforehand that the files/directories do exist and you have the right permissions.
