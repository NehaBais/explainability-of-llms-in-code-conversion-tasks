In C, the `<sys/stat.h>` library includes functions for file and directory operations. Below is a C code which checks whether "input.txt" and "docs" exist in the current working directory as well as in the root of the filesystem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    struct stat buffer;   

    // Check for "input.txt" in the current working directory
    if (stat("./input.txt", &buffer) == 0 && S_ISREG(buffer.st_mode)){
        printf("File input.txt exists and is a regular file.\n");
    } else {
        printf("File input.txt does not exist or it is not a regular file.\n");
    }

    // Check for "input.txt" in the root of the filesystem
    if (stat("/input.txt", &buffer) == 0 && S_ISREG(buffer.st_mode)){
        printf("File input.txt exists and is a regular file.\n");
    } else {
        printf("File input.txt does not exist or it is not a regular file.\n");
    }

    // Check for "docs" in the current working directory
    if (stat("./docs", &buffer) == 0 && S_ISDIR(buffer.st_mode)){
        printf("Directory docs exists and is a directory.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Directory docs does not exist or it is not a directory.\n");
    }

    // Check for "docs" in the root of the filesystem
    if (stat("/docs", &buffer) == 0 && S_ISDIR(buffer.st_mode)){
        printf("Directory docs exists and is a directory.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Directory docs does not exist or it is not a directory.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Please note that this code only checks for existence and type of file or directory, but doesn't throw any error if the program can't access the filesystem. You might want to add some error handling in production code to make it robust against all possible issues.
