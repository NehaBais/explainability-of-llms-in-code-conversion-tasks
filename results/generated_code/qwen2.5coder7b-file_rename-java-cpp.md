Sure! Here is the equivalent C++ code for renaming files and directories both in the current working directory and in the filesystem root. Note that in C++, you need to include the `<filesystem>` header (introduced in C++17) to perform file system operations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <filesystem>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

bool renameFile(const fs::path& oldname, const fs::path& newname) {
    // Rename file or directory
    bool success = fs::rename(oldname, newname);
    return success;
}

void test(const std::string& type, const fs::path& oldname, const fs::path& newname) {
    std::cout << "The following " << type << " called " 
              << oldname.filename().string() 
              << (renameFile(oldname, newname) ? " was renamed as " : " could not be renamed into ")
              << newname.filename().string()
              << "." << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Current working directory
    fs::path currentDir = fs::current_path();
    test("file", currentDir / "input.txt", currentDir / "output.txt");
    test("directory", currentDir / "docs", currentDir / "mydocs");

    // Filesystem root
    fs::path rootDir = fs::path("/");
    test("file", rootDir / "input.txt", rootDir / "output.txt");
    test("directory", rootDir / "docs" / "", rootDir / "mydocs" / "");

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Namespace and Header Inclusion**: The `std::filesystem` namespace is used for file system operations, and it's included at the beginning of the code.
2. **Function `renameFile`**: This function takes two `fs::path` objects (representing the old and new paths) and attempts to rename the file or directory using `fs::rename`.
3. **Function `test`**: This function prints a message indicating whether the file or directory was successfully renamed.
4. **Main Function**:
   - It gets the current working directory using `fs::current_path()`.
   - It constructs paths for renaming files and directories in both the current working directory and the filesystem root.
   - It calls the `test` function to perform the renaming operations and print the results.

### Notes:
- The `rootDir / "docs" / ""` and `rootDir / "mydocs" / ""` are used to ensure that the paths end with a slash, which is required for directories in some file systems.
- This code assumes that the user has the necessary permissions to rename files and directories.
