Sure, here's the equivalent Python code for your requirement.
```python
# Get two integers from the user
a = int(input('Enter first integer: '))
b = int(input('Enter second integer: '))

# test for less-than
if a < b : 
    print(f'{a} is less than {b}')

# test for equality
if a == b : 
    print(f'{a} is equal to {b}')

# test for greater-than
if a > b :
    print(f'{a} is greater than {b}')
```
