```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    var string = "abc"
    fmt.Println(string)
    string += "def"
    fmt.Println(string)
}
```
In Golang, the `+=` operator is used for concatenation. It performs a string concatenation operation on the left-hand side operand and then assigns it back to the variable on the right-hand side of the equation. This is different from Java where the `+` operator performs addition. However, both operators perform concatenation in Golang as well.
