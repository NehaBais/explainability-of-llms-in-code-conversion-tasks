 In Python, you can use the `os` module to perform similar actions. Here is how you would translate that Java code into Python:

```python
import os

def create_files_and_dirs():
    try:
        # Current working directory
        os.mknod("output.txt")
        os.makedirs("/docs") 
        
        # Root filesystem
        with open("/output.txt", "w"): pass
        os.makedirs("/docs") 
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

create_files_and_dirs()
```

In the above Python script, the `os.mknod` function is used to create a new file with the given name in the current working directory and the `os.makedirs` function is used to create a directory in the filesystem root.

Note: These methods will work only if you have the necessary permissions (usually, write permissions) for creating files/directories at the specified paths.
