Below is the equivalent C++ code for the Rust code you provided:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    namespace fs = std::filesystem;

    if (fs::exists("input.txt")) {
        try {
            // Move "docs" to "mydocs" in current working directory
            fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
            fs::rename("docs",  "mydocs");

            // Move "docs" to "mydocs" in filesystem root
            fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
            fs::rename("/docs",  "/mydocs");
        } catch (std::filesystem::filesystem_error &e) {
            std::cerr << e.what() << '\n';
            return EXIT_FAILURE;
        }
    } else {
        std::cout << "The file 'input.txt' does not exist.\n";
        return 1;
    }
}
```

I have used the `std::filesystem` library in C++ to implement similar functionalities as those available in Rust's `fs` module. The try-catch block is used for error handling, and `EXIT_FAILURE` is returned if an exception occurs during the file rename operation. If the input file does not exist, a message indicating this is printed to the console with `std::cout`.

In terms of renaming the files or directories, C++ follows the same naming convention as Rust: the "from" and "to" path names are provided as function arguments to the `rename` function.
