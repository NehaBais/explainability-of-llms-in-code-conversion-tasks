The Java code will look like this:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Here
        rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
        rename("docs", "mydocs");
        
        // In the filesystem root (Assuming current directory is not root, 
        // and file or directory exists in root, else exception will occur)
        rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
        rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
    }
    
    private static void rename(String from, String to){
        File oldFile = new File(from);
        File newFile = new File(to);
        
        // Move/Rename file
        if (oldFile.renameTo(newFile)) {
            System.out.println("Successfully moved " + from  + " to " + to);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to move " + from  + " to " + to );
        }    
    }
}
```
Please note that in Java we need to handle the file paths and also check if files or directories exist before trying to rename them, otherwise, `FileNotFoundException` will occur at runtime. 

Also keep in mind that attempting to move a directory into an existing file or vice versa can cause problems, so always ensure you're giving valid paths to the method. If you try to move a directory (or file) into another directory without specifying the new name first, it will result in this exception. 

Also please be aware that trying to rename files/directories outside of your current working directory or root level can lead to unexpected behavior as Java runtime does not allow moving directories out of the filesystem root by default. You may need some permissions for it but usually it's not recommended due security concerns. Please be mindful while using such functions.
