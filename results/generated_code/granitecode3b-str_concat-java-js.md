Here's the JavaScript code that accomplishes the same task:
```
const s = "hello";
console.log(s + " literal");
const s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```
The output of this code will be:

hello literal
hello literal

As you can see, the original string `s` is concatenated with the string literal `"literal"` to create a new string `s2`. The content of both variables is then printed to the console.
