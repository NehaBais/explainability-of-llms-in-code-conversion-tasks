In C++, the `std::rename()` function does not include the ability to rename directories directly. However, you can achieve directory renaming by first moving all files from the old directory to a new one and then deleting the old directory. Below is an example of how to perform these operations using C++:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;

int main() {
    // Rename "input.txt" into "output.txt" in current working directory
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");

    // Rename "docs" into "mydocs" in current working directory
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs");

    // Move all files from old directory to new one and delete the old directory in root
    for (const auto & entry : fs::directory_iterator("/root/docs")) {
        if (!entry.is_directory())
            fs::rename(entry, "/root/mydocs/" + entry.path().filename());
    }

    // Remove the empty "docs" directory in root
    fs::remove("/root/docs");

    return 0;
}
```
Please note that this code assumes you have write permissions to the directories. Also, it is important to specify full path for the old and new names of your files/directories as `std::rename()` only works with relative paths from the current directory.

Also, you should replace "/root" in the code with the actual root directory.
