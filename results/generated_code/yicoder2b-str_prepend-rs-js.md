Sure, here is how you can convert the above code into JavaScript:

```javascript
let s = 'World'; 
s = "Hello " + s;
console.log(s);
```

This JavaScript code does the same thing as the Rust code - creating a string variable `s` and prepending it with `"Hello "`. It also logs this modified string to the console.
