Sure, here's how you can convert that JavaScript code into C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char *s = ", World";
    char new_s[50]; // Make sure this is large enough to hold both strings
    
    // Prepend the string variable with another string literal.
    sprintf(new_s, "Hello%s", s);
    
    printf("%s\n", new_s);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In C, there's no built-in `prepend` function like in JavaScript. Instead, you can use the `sprintf` function to concatenate strings into a buffer. The `%s` format specifier is used for string arguments.

**Note:** Ensure that the buffer (`new_s`) is large enough to hold both the concatenated strings. If you're dealing with potentially long strings or want more control over memory management, consider using dynamic allocation with `malloc()` and remember to free the allocated memory when done.
