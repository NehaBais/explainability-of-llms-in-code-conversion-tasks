Sure! Below is the equivalent Python code that performs the same file and directory renaming tasks as described:

```python
import os

def rename_file(oldname, newname):
    # Rename file (or directory)
    success = os.rename(oldname, newname) is not None
    return success

def test(type_name, oldname, newname):
    print(f"The following {type_name} called {oldname} "
          f"{'was renamed as' if rename_file(oldname, newname) else 'could not be renamed into'} "
          f"{newname}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Current working directory
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt")
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs")

    # Filesystem root (Note: The filesystem root can vary between operating systems)
    if os.name == 'nt':  # Windows
        separator = "\\"
    else:  # Unix-like (Linux, macOS)
        separator = "/"

    root_path = f"{separator}"

    test("file", root_path + "input.txt", root_path + "output.txt")
    test("directory", root_path + "docs" + separator, root_path + "mydocs" + separator)
```

### Explanation:
1. **rename_file Function**: This function uses `os.rename()` to rename a file or directory.
2. **test Function**: This function prints out whether the renaming was successful.
3. **Main Execution**:
   - Renames files and directories in the current working directory.
   - Renames files and directories in the filesystem root, adapting the separator based on the operating system.

This script should work across different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) as long as Python is installed.
