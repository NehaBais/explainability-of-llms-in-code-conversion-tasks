## Solution:
The following code converts the given Golang program to Rust using a similar approach as described in my previous answer. The changes are as follows:

1. In the `main` function, we use string literals instead of variables for strings `"cat"` and `"dog"`. This allows us to directly compare them without needing separate variable declarations.
2. We import the `std::string::String` module from Rust's standard library to handle string comparisons.
3. We use the `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `lt`, `ge`, and `le` methods of the `String` struct for comparison operations, which are similar to their Go language counterparts in terms of functionality.
4. For case-insensitive comparison, we utilize the Rust's standard library function `eq_ignore_ascii_case()` from the string module to compare strings without considering ASCII letter casing. If necessary, this can be modified for a more thorough treatment that also accounts for Unicode code point normalization and locale-dependent comparisons.
5. In terms of numeric string comparison, Rust will automatically interpret numbers as their numerical value when comparing them with other numerical values or character types such as `char`, which is similar to how Go handles these comparisons. However, it's important to note that direct comparison between strings representing numbers and non-numeric characters may yield unexpected results due to type coercion.
6. Finally, we also demonstrate additional string equality checks like comparing two strings lexicographically using the Rust library function `cmp::Ordering::eq` from the crate std::cmp.

```rust
use std::string;

fn main() {
    let c = "cat";
    let d = "dog";
    
    // Compare bytewise equality and inequality
    if c == d {
        println!("{} is identical to {}", c, d);
    } else {
        println!("{} is not equal to {}", c, d);
    }
    
    // Compare strings lexically for ordering
    match string::String::cmp(c, d) {
        std::cmp::Ordering::Less => println!("{} is less than {}", c, d),
        std::cmp::Ordering::Equal => println!("{} is equal to {}", c, d),
        std::cmp::Ordering::Greater => println!("{} is greater than {}", c, d)
    }
    
    // Case-insensitive comparison using Rust's built-in string function for case folding
    if string::String::eq_ignore_ascii_case(c, d) {
        println!("Case insensitive: {} equals {}", c, d);
    } else {
        println!("Case insensitive: {} does not equal {}", c, d);
    }
    
    // Numeric string comparison (Rust will automatically interpret numbers as their numerical value when compared with other numeric values or characters)
    let a = "123";
    let b = 456;
    if a == b {
        println!("{} equals {}", a, b);
    } else {
        println!("{} does not equal {}", a, b);
    }
    
    // Additional string comparison using Rust's built-in library function for lexicographic ordering of strings
    let e = "apple";
    let f = "banana";
    if std::cmp::Ordering::eq(e.as_str(), f) {
        println!("{} and {} are lexically equal", e, f);
    } else {
        println!("{} and {} are not lexically equal", e, f);
    }
}
```
