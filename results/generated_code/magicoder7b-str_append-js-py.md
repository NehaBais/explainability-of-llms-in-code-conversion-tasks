 In Python, you can achieve this by using the `+` operator for string concatenation or by using the `join()` method of string objects:

Here's how to do it in both ways:

Option 1: Using the `+=` operator:

```python
s1 = "Hello"
s1 += ", World!"
print(s1)
```

Option 2: Using the `.join()` method:

s1 = "Hello"
s1 = s1 + ", World!"
print(s1)
