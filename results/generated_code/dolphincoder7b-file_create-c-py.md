Sure, here's the Python code that does what you need:
```python
import os

def create_output_and_docs():
    # Creating output.txt file of size 0 bytes in current directory
    with open('output.txt', 'w'):
        pass

    # Creating docs/ directory in filesystem root
    os.makedirs('/docs')


create_output_and_docs()
```
This code does not actually create files or directories, but it simulates the process of creating them. For creating a file, you can use `open` function with `'w'` mode to create an empty file. Similarly, for creating a directory, you can use `os.makedirs()` function. The `'w'` mode is used to open the file in write mode, but it doesn't truncate the existing content if any. In Python, directories are not created with permissions; they will have the default file permissions which are usually set to read and execute by a process running as root, rather than the current user permissions. Therefore, you need to provide the desired permissions using `os` module or by setting the `umask` value appropriately beforehand.
