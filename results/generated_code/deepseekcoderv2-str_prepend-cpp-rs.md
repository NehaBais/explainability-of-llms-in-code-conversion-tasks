 Certainly! Below is the equivalent Rust code for the provided C++ code. The task is to create a string variable equal to any text value, prepend it with another string literal, and then print the result.

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_strings = vec!["prepended to", "my string"];
    let mut concatenated: String = String::new();
    
    for s in my_strings {
        if !concatenated.is_empty() {
            concatenated.push_str(" ");
        }
        concatenated.push_str(s);
    }
    
    println!("{}", concatenated);
}
```

In this Rust code:
- We use a `Vec<&str>` to hold the strings we want to concatenate.
- We initialize an empty `String` called `concatenated`.
- We iterate over the vector, adding each string to the `concatenated` string with a space in between (if it's not the first element).
- Finally, we print the concatenated result using `println!`.
