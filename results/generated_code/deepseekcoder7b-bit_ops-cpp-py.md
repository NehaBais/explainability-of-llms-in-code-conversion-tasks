The Python version of the code is as follows. Note that the bitwise NOT operation (~) in python only works on integers and can't be used with other types. Also, there are no rotation operators in Python but we can use built-in functions like `<<` for left shift and `>>` for right shift to achieve similar results.
```python
def bitwise(a, b):
  print("a and b: ", a & b)
  print("a or b:  ", a | b)
  print("a xor b: ", a ^ b)
  
  # Python doesn't support bitwise NOT on floats/complex numbers; it supports only integers.
  try:
    print("not a:    ", ~a)
  except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    
  print("a shl b: ", a << b)
  print("a shr b: ", a >> b)
  
  # Python's right shift operator performs arithmetic shift for negative numbers which is the same as logical shift in C/C++.
  ua = a & 0xffffffff  # Mask to treat 'a' as unsigned integer (32 bit)
  print("a lsr b: ", ua >> b)
  
  # There are no built-in functions for left rotation and right rotation in Python. But they can be easily implemented using bitwise operations.
  def rotl(n, d):
    return (n << d)|(n >> (32 - d))
    
  def rotr(n ,d):
    return (n >> d)|(n << (32 - d)) & 0xffffffff
  
  print("a rol b: ", rotl(ua, b))
  print("a ror b: ", rotr(ua, b))
```
