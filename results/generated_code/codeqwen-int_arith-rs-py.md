The given Rust code is reading command line arguments and performing the operations as required. However, it doesn't include error handling for when the user inputs non-numeric values or provides less than two command line arguments. Here is a Python version of your Rust program with error handling:

```python
import sys

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print("Please provide two integer numbers as command line arguments.")
        return
    try:
        A = int(sys.argv[1])
        B = int(sys.argv[2])
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input! Please provide two numeric arguments.")
        return

    print("sum:              {}".format(A + B))
    print("difference:       {}".format(A - B))
    print("product:          {}".format(A * B))
    print("integer quotient: {:.0f}".format(A / B)) # truncates towards zero
    print("remainder:        {}".format(A % B)) # same sign as first operand

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python program reads command line arguments and performs the operations as required. It includes error handling for when the user provides less than two command line arguments or inputs non-numeric values. The result of integer division is rounded towards zero by using {:.0f} format specifier in print function.
