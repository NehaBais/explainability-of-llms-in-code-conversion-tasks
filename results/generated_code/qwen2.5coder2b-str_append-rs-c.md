To convert the Rust code to C, you would need to understand that the Rust `String` type is not available in C. Instead, you would use a character array and perform string concatenation using the `strcat` function from the standard library.

Here's the equivalent C code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char hello[] = "Hello world";
    strcat(hello, "!!!!");
    printf("%s\n", hello);
}
```

In this code:
- The `strcat` function is used to concatenate the string literal `"!!!!"` to the end of the character array `hello`.
- The `%s` format specifier is used in the `printf` function to print the contents of the concatenated string.
- The `strlen` function (not available in C) would be necessary if you needed to know the length of the original string before concatenating. However, the size of the character array (`hello`) in this example does not need to change based on the appended string.
- Note that C does not have a built-in equivalent for Rust's `Add` trait and the `add` method. If your code needs addition operations (which is not possible with strings), you would need to handle the addition manually by converting the strings to numbers, performing the operation, and then converting them back to strings.

If the task was to create a string of specific length and append it, you might use functions like `malloc` or `calloc`, but this would require dynamic memory allocation which is not available in C.
