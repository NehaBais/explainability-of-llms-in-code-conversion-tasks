The Python code is quite similar to the C++ one, it uses shutil and os libraries for file operations such as rename. Below is equivalent Python code:

```python
import os
import shutil

def main():
    # Rename current directory files
    os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt')
    os.rename('docs', 'mydocs')
    
    # For root filesystem, we have to provide full path 
    # because Python script and file operations are running in different directories
    shutil.move('/home/user/input.txt', '/home/user/output.txt')
    shutil.move('/home/user/docs', '/home/user/mydocs')    
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: In this Python code you will need to replace "/home/user" with the full path of your current directory because Python script and file operations are running in different directories.
