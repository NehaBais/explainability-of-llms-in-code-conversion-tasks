To convert the given C code to JavaScript, you can use Node.js's `fs` module to access the file system and `path` module to manipulate paths. Here's an example of how you could do this:
```
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Verify the size of a file called input.txt in the current working directory
const stat1 = fs.statSync(path.join(__dirname, 'input.txt'));
console.log(`The size of input.txt is ${stat1.size} bytes`);

// Verify the size of a file called /input.txt in the file system root
const stat2 = fs.statSync('/input.txt');
console.log(`The size of /input.txt is ${stat2.size} bytes`);
```
Note that this code assumes that you have already installed Node.js and set up a development environment on your machine. If you haven't done so, you can install Node.js from the official website.
