 Certainly! Below is the equivalent Python code for the provided Go code:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
text = "foo"

# Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way
text += "bar"

# Show the contents of the variable after the append operation
print(text)
```

In this Python code:
1. We initialize a string variable `text` with the value `"foo"`.
2. We use the `+=` operator to append the string literal `"bar"` to the existing string in the variable.
3. Finally, we print the contents of the variable after the append operation using the `print()` function.
