The equivalent Python code is as follows:

```python
# Change the string variable with another string literal
c_str = "Changed"
p_string = "my String"
resulting_string = c_str + p_string
print(resulting_string)
```
This python script will concatenate (prepend) the `c_str` to the `p_string` and print out the resulting string. In Python, you don't have to worry about memory management like in C when using 'strdup'. The '+' operator is used for string concatenation.
