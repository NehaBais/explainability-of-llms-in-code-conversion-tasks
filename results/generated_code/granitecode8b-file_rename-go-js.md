Here's the converted code from Golang to JavaScript that meets the given requirements:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
try {
  // Rename file in current working directory
  fs.renameSync('input.txt', 'output.txt');
  fs.renameSync('docs', 'mydocs');
  // Rename file in root directory
  fs.renameSync('/input.txt', '/output.txt');
  fs.renameSync('/docs', '/mydocs');
  console.log('Files and directories renamed successfully.');
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Error renaming files and directories:', err);
}
```
This code uses the `fs` module from Node.js to rename files and directories. The `renameSync()` method is used to perform synchronous file or directory renaming, which means it will block until the operation completes. If any errors occur during the renaming process, they are caught using a try-catch block and logged to the console.
