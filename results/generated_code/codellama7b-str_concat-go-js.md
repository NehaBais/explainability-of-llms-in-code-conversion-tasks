Sure, I can help you with that! Here's the code in JavaScript:
```
const s = 'hello';
console.log(s);
console.log(s + ' literal');
const s2 = s + ' literal';
console.log(s2);
```
Explanation:

* In Go, we use `:=` to declare a variable and initialize it with a value at the same time. In JavaScript, we use `var`, `let`, or `const` to declare a variable and assign a value to it later. In this case, we're using `const` because we don't want to reassign the value of `s`.
* Go has a built-in `fmt` package that we can use to print values to the console. In JavaScript, we have a global object called `console` that has a `log()` method that we can use to print values.
* The only difference between the two languages when it comes to string concatenation is that in Go, we use the `+` operator, while in JavaScript, we use the `+` operator or the `concat()` method (which is not as common).
* In Go, we don't need to declare a separate variable for the concatenated string because we can directly assign it to another variable. In JavaScript, we do need to declare a separate variable for the concatenated string and assign the result of the concatenation to it.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
