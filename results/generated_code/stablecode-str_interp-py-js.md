In JavaScript, we use template literals for string interpolation. The syntax uses backticks (` `)) instead of single or double quotes (' ' or " ")). Here's how you can convert the Python code to JavaScript:

```javascript
let extra = 'little';
let new_str = `Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`;
console.log(new_str);
```

In this JavaScript code, we first declare and initialize the variable `extra`. Then, using template literals (the backticks before and after the string)), we interpolate the value of `extra` into the original string. Finally, we log the resulting string to the console.
