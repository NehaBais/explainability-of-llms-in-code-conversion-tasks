Here is the Rust code that meets the requirements:
```
use std::fs;
fn main() {
 fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").unwrap();
 fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").unwrap();
 fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt").unwrap();
 fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs").unwrap();
}
```
This code uses the `std::fs` module to rename files and directories. The `unwrap()` method is used to handle any errors that may occur during the renaming process. The code renames "input.txt" to "output.txt" and "docs" to "mydocs", as well as "/input.txt" to "/output.txt" and "/docs" to "/mydocs".
