The C version of the code can be converted to C++ with minimal effort, as there are no significant differences in syntax between C and C++. The main difference is the use of `std::rename` instead of `rename`, which is a part of the `<iostream>` library in C++17.
Here's the equivalent C++ code:
```cpp
#include 
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    rename("docs", "mydocs");
    rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
    return 0;
}
```
The `rename` function is used to change the name of a file or directory. In C, it returns 0 on success and -1 if there's an error. In C++, the function is renamed to `std::rename` due to naming conflicts with the system functions. Also note that `using namespace std;` must be included in C++ code to use the `rename` function.

To run the program, you can save it in a file called `main.cpp`, and then compile and execute it as follows:

g++ -o rename main.cpp
./rename

This will create an executable named "rename" that you can use to perform the required renaming. Please remember to replace "input.txt", "output.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", and "/docs" with your actual filenames and directories.
