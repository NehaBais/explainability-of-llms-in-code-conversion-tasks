Below is the Java code converted to C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {

    std::string string = "abc";
    std::cout << string << std::endl;
    string += "def";
    std::cout << string << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code does exactly the same as your Java code. It creates a string variable and assigns it the value "abc". It then prints out the contents of this variable. Afterwards, it appends the string literal "def" to the end of the existing string. Finally, it prints out the final contents of the string variable.
