 Below is the equivalent Python code for the given Golang program.

```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    print('a:   {}'.format(bin(a)[2:]))
    print('b:   {}'.format(bin(b & 0xffff)[2:]))
    
    # Bitwise logical operations
    and_res = a & b
    print('and: {}'.format(bin(and_res & 0xffff)[2:]))
    
    or_res = a | b
    print('or:  {}'.format(bin(or_res & 0xffff)[2:]))

    xor_res = a ^ b
    print('xor: {}'.format(bin(xor_res & 0xffff)[2:]))
    
    not_a = ~a
    print('not: {}'.format(bin(not_a & 0xffff)[2:]))

    if b < 0:
        print("Right operand is negative, but all shifts require an unsigned right operand (shift distance).")
        return
    
    ua = a & 0xffff
    ub = b & 0xffff

    # Logical shifts (unsigned left operand)
    shl_res = ua << ub
    print('shl: {}'.format(bin(shl_res & 0xffff)[2:]))
    
    shr_res = ua >> ub
    print('shr: {}'.format(bin(shr_res & 0xffff)[2:]))

    # Arithmetic shifts (signed left operand)
    las_res = a << ub
    print('las: {}'.format(bin(las_res & 0xffff)[2:]))
    
    ras_res = a >> ub
    print('ras: {}'.format(bin(ras_res & 0xffff)[2:]))

    # Rotations
    rol_res = (a << b) | ((a >> (16 - b)) if (a >> (16 - b)) >= 0 else (a >> (16 - b)) + 65536)
    print('rol: {}'.format(bin(rol_res & 0xffff)[2:]))
    
    ror_res = ((a << (16 - b)) | a >> b if a < 0 else a >> b) % 65536
    print('ror: {}'.format(bin(ror_res & 0xffff)[2:]))

a, b = -460, 6
bitwise(a, b)
```

The Python code also performs all the same bitwise operations as the Golang version. Note that in Python, we use a binary string format to display the numbers and it has an implicit `0b` prefix for binary numbers (like Golang does), so there's no need to slice it manually with `[2:]`.
Also, unlike Go, you don't have to specify the bit length of an integer in Python. It is automatically determined by the type. The `& 0xffff` operation is equivalent to casting the int16 (or smaller) values to uint16, so we can perform operations on them as if they were unsigned.
For the shift operations, Python implicitly handles the signed right operand and ensures that it's within the valid range of a 16-bit integer.
