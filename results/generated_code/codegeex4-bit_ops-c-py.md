Here is your converted Python code:

```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    print(f"a and b: {a & b}")
    print(f"a or b: {a | b}")
    print(f"a xor b: {a ^ b}")
    print(f"not a: {~a}")
    print(f"a << n: {a << b}")  # left shift
    print(f"a >> n: {a >> b}")  # on most platforms: arithmetic right shift
    # convert the signed integer into unsigned, so it will perform logical shift
    c = a + (2**32 if a < 0 else 0)
    print(f"c >> b: {c >> b}")  # logical right shift
    # there are no rotation operators in Python, but we can use bit shifting to simulate it
    rotated_left = ((a << b) & 0xFFFFFFFF) | (a >> (32 - b))
    rotated_right = ((a >> b) & 0xFFFFFFFF) | (a << (32 - b))
    print(f"a rotated left: {rotated_left}")
    print(f"a rotated right: {rotated_right}")

bitwise(10, 2)
```

This Python function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, then performs bitwise AND, OR, XOR operations on them. It also performs bitwise NOT operation on `a`, and left shift, arithmetic right shift, and logical right shift operations using `b` as the shift amount. The rotation operations are simulated by bit shifting.

Please note that Python's right shift is an arithmetic shift, so we don't need to convert the signed integer into unsigned for right shift operation. We do it for left rotation but then discard all higher bits which could have been used in a real rotation operation. 

Also, Python doesn't support bitwise rotations directly as C does. To simulate a left rotation by `n` positions, we can use `(a << n) | (a >> (32 - n))`. Similarly, for right rotation by `n` positions, we can use `(a >> n) | (a << (32 - n))`. The number 32 is used because it's the size of an integer in bits on most systems.
