Here's your Java code converted into C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {

    int nbr1, nbr2;

    std::cout << "Enter first integer: ";
    std::cin >> nbr1;

    std::cout << "Enter second integer: ";
    std::cin >> nbr2;


    if(nbr1<nbr2))
        std::cout << nbr1 << " is less than " << nbr2 << std::endl;

    if(nbr1>nbr2))
        std::cout << nbr1 << " is greater than " << nbr2 << std::endl;


    if(nbr1==nbr2))
        std::cout << nbr1 << " is equal to " << nbr2 << std::endl;


    return 0;
}
```

The logic remains the same and since C++ is a relatively new language compared to Java, you'll notice that there are fewer resources available in C++, so it's important to be mindful of that when writing your code.
