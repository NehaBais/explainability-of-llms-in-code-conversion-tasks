Sure, here's how you can write this in Java:
```java
// Declare and assign the variable 's' as a String value
String s = "hello";

// Create another string variable with the concatenated result of 's' and another string literal 
String t = s + " there!";

// Print out the contents of 't' to confirm the operation
System.out.println(t);
```
This Java code does exactly the same as your JavaScript version. It creates a variable `s` that contains the text "hello", and then creates another string variable `t` that is the concatenation of `s` and another string literal (" there!"). The last line prints out `t` to confirm it's holding the correct value.
