Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task:
```
import os
with open('output.txt', 'w'):
 pass
os.makedirs('docs')
os.makedirs('/docs')
```
The `open()` function in Python is used to create an empty file, and the `makedirs()` function creates a directory. The `'w'` mode is used with the `open()` function to open the file for writing, which effectively creates the file if it doesn't already exist. The `makedirs()` function creates a new directory and all its parent directories as needed.
