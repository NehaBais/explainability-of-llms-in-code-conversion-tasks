The provided Golang code can be converted into Python as follows:
```python
def main():
    # text assigned to a string variable
    s = "hello"

    print(s)  # prints the value of s (which is "hello" in this case)

    print(s + " literal")  # prints the concatenation of s and " literal"

    # concatenate variable and literal, assign result to another string variable
    s2 = s + " literal"

    print(s2)  # prints the value of s2 (which is "hello literal" in this case)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
