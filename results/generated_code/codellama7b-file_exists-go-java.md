In Java, you can use the `File` class to verify if a file or directory exists. Here's an example of how to convert the code:
```java
import java.io.File;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File inputFile = new File("input.txt");
        File docsDirectory = new File("docs");

        if (inputFile.exists()) {
            System.out.println("input.txt exists");
        } else {
            System.out.println("input.txt does not exist");
        }

        if (docsDirectory.exists()) {
            System.out.println("docs directory exists");
        } else {
            System.out.println("docs directory does not exist");
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, we use the `File` class to create instances of `input.txt` and `docs`. We then check if each file or directory exists using the `exists()` method. If it doesn't exist, we print a message indicating that it does not exist. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that it does exist.

Note that in Java, you can also use the `isDirectory()` method to check if a file is a directory or not. This method returns a boolean value, so you can use an `if` statement to determine whether the file is a directory or not. For example:

if (inputFile.isDirectory()) {
    System.out.println("input.txt is a directory");
} else {
    System.out.println("input.txt is a file");
}

In this code, we use the `isDirectory()` method to check if `input.txt` is a directory or not. If it is a directory, we print a message indicating that it is a directory. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that it is a file.

You can also use the `isFile()` method to check if a file is a regular file or not. This method returns a boolean value, so you can use an `if` statement to determine whether the file is a regular file or not. For example:

if (inputFile.isFile()) {
    System.out.println("input.txt is a regular file");
} else {
    System.out.println("input.txt is something else");
}

In this code, we use the `isFile()` method to check if `input.txt` is a regular file or not. If it is a regular file, we print a message indicating that it is a regular file. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that it is something else (e.g., a directory).

You can use the same approach to check if a directory exists by using the `exists()` method on the `File` instance representing the directory. For example:

if (docsDirectory.exists()) {
    System.out.println("docs directory exists");
} else {
    System.out.println("docs directory does not exist");
}

In this code, we use the `exists()` method to check if the `docs` directory exists. If it does exist, we print a message indicating that it does exist. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that it does not exist.
