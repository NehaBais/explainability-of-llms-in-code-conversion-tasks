 Sure, here's the equivalent code in GoLang that demonstrates the requested comparisons:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func compare(A, B string) {
	if A == B {
		fmt.Printf("'%s' and '%s' are lexically equal.\n", A, B)
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("'%s' and '%s' are not lexically equal.\n", A, B)
	}

	if strings.EqualFold(A, B) {
		fmt.Printf("'%s' and '%s' are case-insensitive lexically equal.\n", A, B)
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("'%s' and '%s' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.\n", A, B)
	}

	if strings.Compare(A, B) < 0 {
		fmt.Printf("'%s' is lexically before '%s'.\n", A, B)
	} else if strings.Compare(A, B) > 0 {
		fmt.Printf("'%s' is lexically after '%s'.\n", A, B)
	}

	if strings.Compare(A, B) >= 0 {
		fmt.Printf("'%s' is not lexically before '%s'.\n", A, B)
	}
	if strings.Compare(A, B) <= 0 {
		fmt.Printf("'%s' is not lexically after '%s'.\n", A, B)
	}

	fmt.Printf("The lexical relationship is: %d\n", strings.Compare(A, B))
	fmt.Printf("The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: %d\n", strings.Compare(strings.ToLower(A), strings.ToLower(B)))
}

func main() {
	compare("Hello", "Hello")
	compare("5", "5.0")
	compare("java", "Java")
	compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ")
	compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĵãvá")
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Comparing two strings for exact equality**: 
   - In Go, string comparison is done using the `==` operator.
   
2. **Comparing two strings for inequality**: 
   - This is achieved by negating the result of the exact equality check (`!=`).

3. **Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other**: 
   - Use `strings.Compare(A, B)` which returns `< 0` if `A` is less than `B`, and so on.

4. **Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after than the other**: 
   - This can be determined by checking if the result of `strings.Compare(A, B)` is greater than zero.

5. **Case sensitive comparisons**: 
   - Case sensitivity is handled naturally in Go using string comparison operators and methods like `strings.Compare`.

6. **Case insensitive comparisons**: 
   - Use `strings.EqualFold` for case-insensitive equality checks. For lexical order, use `strings.Compare` with both strings converted to lowercase if needed: `strings.Compare(strings.ToLower(A), strings.ToLower(B))`.

7. **Comparison of numeric strings**: 
   - If numeric strings are not treated lexically, they will be compared based on their string value, which may not always be the intended behavior. For numerical comparison, consider converting them to appropriate numeric types for accurate comparisons.

This Go code mirrors the functionality of the provided Java code and demonstrates various aspects of string comparisons in Go.
