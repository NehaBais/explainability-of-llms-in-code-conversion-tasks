The Rust version of this code would look like this:
```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    assert!(fs::metadata("input.txt").is_ok()); // current working directory
    assert!(fs::metadata("/docs/input.txt").is_ok()); // file and directory in the filesystem root
}
```
Note: I have omitted the error handling for brevity, but you need to add it back if needed. The `fs` module in Rust has a function `metadata()` that can be used to check if files or directories exist, and also get information about them like their size, last modification time, etc.
