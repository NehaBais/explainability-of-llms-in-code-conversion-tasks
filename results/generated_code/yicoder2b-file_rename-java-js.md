The equivalent JavaScript code for the given Java program would be as follows:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
var renameFile = (oldname, newname) => {
    try{
        return fs.renameSync(oldname, newname); // return true if file/directory is renamed successfully
    } catch(err){ 
       console.log(`Error renaming ${oldname}: ${err}`);  // log error message
       return false;  // else return false
    }
};
var test = (type, oldname, newname) => {
    if (renameFile(oldname, newname)){ 
        console.log(`The ${type} called ${oldname} was renamed as ${newname}`);
    }else{
       console.log(`Error renaming the ${type}: ${oldname} into ${newname}`);
    };
};
const testHere = () => {test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt")};  // Rename file in current directory
fs.realpath('.', function(err, path){ 
   if (!err) console.log(`The current working directory is ${path}`); // Print current working directory
});
const testRoot = () => {test("directory", "docs", "mydocs")};  // Rename directory in root filesystem

testHere();
testRoot();
```
This program uses the `fs` module in Node.js to rename files or directories. If an error occurs during renaming process, it will be logged and the operation won't fail completely. The paths used for testing are relative to the current working directory or root filesystem.
