```cpp
#include <iostream>

void bitwise(int a, int b) {
    std::cout << "a and b: " << (a & b) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a or b: " << (a | b) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a xor b: " << (a ^ b) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "not a: " << (~a) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a << n: " << (a << b) << std::endl;
    unsigned int c = a;
    std::cout << "c >> b: " << (c >> b) << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int a, b;
    std::cout << "Enter two integers a and b: ";
    std::cin >> a >> b;

    bitwise(a, b);

    return 0;
}
```
The conversion of the C code into the C++ version involves basic syntax changes. The `printf` function is replaced with `std::cout`. The bitwise operators in C are directly translated into their counterparts in C++, and C++ does not support left rotate and right rotate operations natively as they do in C.
