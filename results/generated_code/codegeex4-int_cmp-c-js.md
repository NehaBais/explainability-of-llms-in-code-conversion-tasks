Here's how you can convert the given C code into JavaScript:

```javascript
let a = parseInt(prompt("Enter first integer:"));
let b = parseInt(prompt("Enter second integer:"));

if (a < b)
    console.log(`${a} is less than ${b}`);

if (a == b)
    console.log(`${a} is equal to ${b}`);

if (a > b)
    console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b}`);
```

This JavaScript code does the same thing as your C code. It prompts the user to input two integers, then compares them and logs a message accordingly.
