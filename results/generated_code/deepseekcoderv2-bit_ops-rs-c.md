Answer: 
The Rust code provided is used to perform various bitwise operations on two integers, `a` and `b`. These operations include AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`!`), left shift (`<<`), right shift (`>>`), and arithmetic (signed) right shift. The results of these operations are printed in binary format for visual representation.

The Rust code you provided is written in the RUST programming language, which has a syntax similar to C but with some differences. To convert it to C, we need to follow the C syntax rules and make sure that the code is valid. Here's the converted version of your code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned char a = 105; // Assuming u8 in Rust corresponds to unsigned char in C
    unsigned char b = 91; // Assuming u8 in Rust corresponds to unsigned char in C

    printf("a      = %02x\n", a);
    printf("b      = %02x\n", b);
    printf("a | b  = %02x\n", a | b);
    printf("a & b  = %02x\n", a & b);
    printf("a ^ b  = %02x\n", a ^ b);
    // printf("!a     = %02x\n", !a); // This is not valid in C, it's just for illustration purposes.
    printf("a << 3 = %02x\n", (unsigned char) (a << 3)); // left shift is a bitwise operation and cannot be directly converted to unsigned char in Rust, so we cast the result back to unsigned char
    printf("a >> 3 = %02x\n", (unsigned char) (a >> 3)); // right arithmetic shift is also not valid for chars, but same trick can be applied here
    
    return 0;
}
```
