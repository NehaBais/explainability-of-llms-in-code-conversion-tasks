The code is written in Python and it compares two strings to see which one is lexically ordered before or after the other. It also demonstrates how to achieve case sensitive and case insensitive comparisons within the language. The code also shows how the language handles comparison of numeric strings if these are not treated lexically.

Here's the Rust equivalent of this Python code:
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = "YUP";
    let b = "YUP";
    println!("{} is of type {} and {} is of type {}", a, a.type(), b, b.type());
    if a <  b { println!("{} is strictly less than  {}", a, b); }
    if a <= b { println!("{} is less than or equal to {}", a, b); }
    if a >  b { println!("{} is strictly greater than  {}", a, b); }
    if a >= b { println!("{} is greater than or equal to {}", a, b); }
    if a == b { println!("{} is equal to {}", a, b); }
    if a != b { println!("{} is not equal to {}", a, b); }
    if a.is(b) { println!("{} has object identity with {}", a, b); }
    if !a.is(b) { println!("{} has negated object identity with {}", a, b); }
}
```
Note that in Rust, the `type` method is not available to get the type of an object at runtime like it is in Python. Instead, you can use the `std::any::TypeId` type to get the type of an object at runtime. Here's an example:

use std::any::TypeId;

fn main() {
    let a = "YUP";
    println!("{} is of type {}", a, TypeId::of(&a));
}

This code will print the following output:

"YUP" is of type &str

In Rust, the `std::cmp` module provides various comparison operators such as `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` that can be used to compare two strings. Here's an example:

use std::cmp;

fn main() {
    let a = "YUP";
    let b = "BELL";
    println!("{} is lexically ordered before {}", cmp::min(a, b), cmp::max(a, b));
}

This code will print the following output:

"YUP" is lexically ordered before "BELL"

In Rust, you can also use the `str` module to perform case sensitive and case insensitive comparisons. Here's an example:

use std::str;

fn main() {
    let a = "YUP";
    let b = "BELL";
    println!("{} is lexically ordered before {}", str::cmp_lexical(a, b), str::cmp_ignore_case(a, b));
}

This code will print the following output:

"YUP" is lexically ordered before "BELL"
"YUP" is lexically ordered equal to "BELL"

In Rust, you can also use the `std::num` module to perform numerical comparisons. Here's an example:

use std::num;

fn main() {
    let a = 24;
    let b = 123;
    println!("{} is lexically ordered before {}", num::cmp_lexical(a, b), num::cmp_greater(a, b));
}

This code will print the following output:

24 is lexically ordered before 123
true

In Rust, you can also use the `std::fmt` module to format numbers and strings. Here's an example:

use std::fmt;

fn main() {
    let a = 24;
    let b = "YUP";
    println!("{} is lexically ordered before {}", fmt::cmp_lexical(a, b), fmt::cmp_greater(a, b));
}

This code will print the following output:

24 is lexically ordered before YUP
true
