Converting this Rust code to C involves several considerations, such as file I/O and memory management. Here is a rough conversion of the given code from Rust to C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <dirent.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

const char *file_name = "output.txt";
const char *dir_name = "docs";

void create_file(const char *path) {
    FILE *fptr;
    if ((fptr = fopen(path, "w")) == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        exit(1);
    }
    fclose(fptr);
}

void create_dir(const char *path) {
    if (mkdir(path, 0)) {
        perror("Error creating directory");
        exit(1);
    }
}

int main() {
    char cwd[1024];
    getcwd(cwd, sizeof(cwd)));

    create_dir(dir_name);
    create_file(file_name);

    return 0;
}
```

This C code replicates the functionality of the given Rust code. The `create_file` function creates a new empty file with the specified name in the current working directory. The `create_dir` function creates a new empty directory with the specified name in the current working directory. The `main` function calls these functions to create the required files and directories.

Please note that this code assumes that you have appropriate permissions to create files and directories in the current working directory. If you don't have the necessary permissions, you may need to run this code with appropriate privileges or modify it accordingly.
