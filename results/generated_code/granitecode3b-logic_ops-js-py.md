Here's the Python code that performs the same function as the provided JavaScript code:
```python
def logic(a, b):
 print("a AND b:", a and b)
 print("a OR b:", a or b)
 print("NOT a:", not a)
```
Note that the logical operators in Python use the same syntax as in JavaScript. Additionally, the "not" operator is denoted by the keyword "not", not the symbol "~".
