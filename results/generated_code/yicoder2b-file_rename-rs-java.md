The provided Rust code is to rename files and directories in the file system which are present at the current working directory (`here`) and filesystem root. To accomplish this task, we need to use `fs::rename()` function from `std::fs` module in Rust programming language. However, you have not provided any paths for these operations. 

Please provide the absolute paths of directories or files to be renamed as arguments to the `main()` function, and let me know where they are located:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let err = "File move error";
    // Let's assume these paths are in the current working directory
    if let (Ok(src_path), Ok(dest_path)) = (fs::PathBuf::new("input.txt"), fs::PathBuf::new("output.txt")) {
        fs::rename(&src_path, &dest_path).expect(err);
    } else if let (Ok(src_path), Ok(dest_path)) = (fs::PathBuf::new("/input.txt"), fs::PathBuf::new("/output.txt")) {
        fs::rename(&src_path, &dest_path).expect(err);
    } else {}  // Handle error if the paths do not exist
    
    // Let's assume these paths are in filesystem root
    if let (Ok(src_path), Ok(dest_path)) = (fs::PathBuf::new("docs"), fs::PathBuf::new("mydocs.txt")) {
        fs::rename(&src_path, &dest_path).expect(err);
    } else if let (Ok(src_path), Ok(dest_path)) = (fs::PathBuf::new("/docs"), fs::PathBuf::new("/mydocs/")) {
        fs::rename(&src_path, &dest_path).expect(err);
    } else {}  // Handle error if the paths do not exist
}
```

The above code will convert your Rust code to Java. It performs a rename operation from the current working directory (`here`) and filesystem root. If it fails to perform any of these operations, it prints an error message.
