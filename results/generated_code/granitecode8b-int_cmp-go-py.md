Here's the Python code that meets the requirements:
```python
n1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
n2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
if n1 < n2:
 print(f"{n1} is less than {n2}")
elif n1 == n2:
 print(f"{n1} is equal to {n2}")
else:
 print(f"{n1} is greater than {n2}")
```
To test the code, you can run it and enter different numbers as input. For example:
```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 10
5 is less than 10
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 10
10 is equal to 10
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10 is greater than 5
```
