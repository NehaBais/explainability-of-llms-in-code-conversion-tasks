Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
s = "hello"
print(s + " literal"))

# Concatenating strings with another string literal
s2 = s + " literal"
print(s2)
```
This Python script achieves the same functionality as your C++ code. It creates a string variable `s` equal to any text value, and then creates another string variable `s2`, whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal. The content of these variables are printed out at the end.
