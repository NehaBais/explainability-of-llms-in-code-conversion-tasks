Sure, here is the equivalent Java code for the given Rust function:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String a = "abc";
        String b = "Bac".intern(); // This forces a to be interned in memory, which is equivalent to "Bac"

        // String and String or String (&str) can be compared but not &str and String
        if (a == b) { System.out.println("The strings are equal"); }
        if (!(a != b)) { System.out.println("The strings are not equal"); }
        if (a.compareTo(b) > 0) { System.out.println("The first string is lexically after the second"); }
        if (a.compareTo(b) < 0) { System.out.println("The first string is lexically before the second"); }
        if (!(a.compareTo(b) <= 0)) { System.out.println("The first string is not lexically before the second"); }
        if (!(a.compareTo(b) >= 0)) { System.out.println("The first string is not lexically after the second"); }
    }
}
```
Please note that when we are comparing strings in Java, it internally converts both sides to `String` by calling `intern()` if they're `String (&str)`. This will also ensure that two identical non-interned Strings point to the same place in memory and can be compared directly without any conversions or allocations.
