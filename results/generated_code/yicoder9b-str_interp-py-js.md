Here is how you can convert this Python code to JavaScript:

```javascript
let extra = 'little';
let newStr = `Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`;
console.log(newStr);
```

In the given Javascript code, we define `extra` as let so it can be changed later in our program if needed and `newStr` uses template literals (`) which allows us to insert variable values into strings using `${variable}` syntax. The resulting string is then printed out with console.log() function.
