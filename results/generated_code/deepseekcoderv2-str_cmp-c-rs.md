### Solution
The following is the Rust code:

Rust file named `main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut args = std::env::args();
    if let Some(arg) = args.nth(1) {
        let a = &arg;
        let b = args.next().unwrap_or(""); // Assuming there's always an argument after the first one
        
        println!("{}: {}", a, compare(&a, &b));
    } else {
        println!("No arguments provided.");
    }
}

fn compare(a: &str, b: &str) -> String {
    if a == b {
        "Equal".to_string()
    } else if a < b {
        "<".to_string()
    } else {
        ">".to_string()
    }
}
```

This code reads in command-line arguments from the user and compares them. It uses the `compare` function to compare two strings for equality, inequality, lexicographic ordering, or case-insensitive comparison (if applicable).

To compile and run this Rust code on a Linux system with Cargo installed, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the Rust file.
2. Run `cargo build` to create an executable named `main`.
3. Run `./main <arg1> [<arg2>]` to compare strings passed as command-line arguments. If no additional arguments are provided, it will output a message indicating that no comparison can be performed without enough input.
