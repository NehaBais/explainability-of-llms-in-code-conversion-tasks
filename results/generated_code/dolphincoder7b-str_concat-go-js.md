This is how the JavaScript version of your code might look like:

```javascript
let s = "hello";
console.log(s);
console.log(s + " literal"); // This line is not required by the current task description, so it's omitted in JavaScript version
let s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```

In JavaScript, there is no need to assign string literals to variables because strings are immutable and therefore cannot be changed. Also, you do not have direct concatenation operator (+) in JavaScript like you do in Golang. Instead, you can use the + operator to concatenate two strings together.
