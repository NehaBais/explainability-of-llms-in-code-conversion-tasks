```
// Rust code
let mut s = ", World".to_string();
s = format!("{}{}", "Hello", s);
println!("{}", s);
```
The above code is equivalent to the JavaScript code in terms of output. However, there are some differences:
1. In Rust, we use `mut` to declare a variable that can be modified later. In this case, we modify the string `s`.
2. In Rust, we use `format!` instead of concatenating strings with the `+` operator. This is because Rust's `String` type implements the `Display` trait, which allows us to use the `{:?}` format specifier to insert a value into a string.
3. In Rust, we use `println!` to print the contents of a string. This is equivalent to using `print()` in JavaScript.
