The Python version of the code will use the `os` library to verify file size, as there is no standard library for filesystem operations like C++'s `<filesystem>`. Here is how it can be done in Python:

```python
import os

def print_file_size(filename): 
    try: 
        size = os.path<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>.getsize(filename)
        print("Size of file {} is {} bytes.".format(filename, size))
    except Exception as ex: 
        print(ex)

if __name__ == "__main__": 
    print_file_size("input.txt")
    # If the file exists at root directory it should be "/input.txt". Adjust path accordingly if needed
    print_file_size("/input.txt")
```
Please note that:
1) You may need to run this Python script with administrator rights (or sufficient permissions) as the second `print_file_size` call tries to access a file in the root directory ("/input.txt"). 
2) The "os" module's "os.path.getsize()" function raises an error if it can't find or open the specified path, which is caught and printed out by the except block.
3) If you are using Windows and there exists a file named 'input.txt' on your desktop for example, then to locate this file in Python you would need to provide its full absolute path (e.g., `"C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Desktop\\input.txt"`).
4) On Unix systems like Linux or MacOS the root directory is referred as '/', hence it will look for a file named 'input.txt' in the root directory of your file system. For Windows, if you have installed Python using MSYS2/MinGW then the root directory would be C:\\, but this path should not exist on Unix-based systems as there is no concept of Drive Letters on Unix-based filesystems.
5) Please replace "YourUsername" with your actual username in Windows file paths if needed.
