Here is the equivalent code in C++:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string string = "abc";
    std::cout << string << std::endl;
    string += "def";
    std::cout << string << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code does exactly the same thing as your Java code. It initializes a `std::string` object with the value "abc", then appends "def" to it using the `+=` operator, and finally prints out the contents of the string.
