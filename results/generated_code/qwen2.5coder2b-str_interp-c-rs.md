In Rust, we can use `format!` macro to replace the specified characters in the string. Here is your code converted to Rust:
```rust
fn main() {
    let extra = "little";
    println!("Mary had a {} lamb.", extra);
}
```

This code takes advantage of Rust's formatting capabilities to insert the value of `extra` into the string.
