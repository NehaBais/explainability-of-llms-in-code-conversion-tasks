 To convert the given Python code to Rust, you can use the `std::fs` module to get the size of a file. Below is the equivalent Rust code for verifying the size of a file called `input.txt`:

1. For the file in the current working directory.
2. And another one in the file system root.

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Get size of input.txt from the current working directory
    let size_current = fs::metadata("input.txt")?.len();
    println!("Size of input.txt in current directory: {} bytes", size_current);

    // Get size of input.txt from the root directory
    let size_root = fs::metadata("/input.txt")?;
    println!("Size of /input.txt (root directory): {} bytes", size_root.len());

    Ok(())
}
```

### Explanation:
- `fs::metadata` is used to get the metadata of a file, including its length (`len()` method).
- The first call uses `"input.txt"` which assumes the current working directory.
- The second call uses `/input.txt`, which tries to access the file from the root directory. This requires appropriate permissions and might not work in all environments without superuser privileges.

### Running the Code:
To run this Rust code, you need to have Rust installed on your system. Save the code to a file named `main.rs` and then compile and run it using the following commands:


rustc main.rs
./main


If you want to ensure that the second path is correct, make sure that `/input.txt` exists and you have permission to access it in the file system root.
