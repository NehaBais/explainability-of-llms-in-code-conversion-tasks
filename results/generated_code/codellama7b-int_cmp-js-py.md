 Here's the Python code for the above JavaScript code:
```python
def compare(a, b):
    if a == b:
        print(f"{a} equals {b}")
    elif a < b:
        print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
    elif a > b:
        print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
    else:
        print(f"{a} and {b} are not of the same type and cannot be compared.")
```
The code uses f-strings to format the output strings, which makes it more readable. Also, the `else` block is added to handle the case where a and b are not of the same type, as suggested in the comments.
