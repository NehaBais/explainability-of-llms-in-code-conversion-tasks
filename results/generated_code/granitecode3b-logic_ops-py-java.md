Here's the equivalent Java code for the given Python function:
```
public class Logic {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  boolean a = true;
  boolean b = false;
  
  System.out.println("a and b: " + (a && b));
  System.out.println("a or b: " + (a || b));
  System.out.println("not a: " + (!a));
 }
}
```
This Java code defines a class called `Logic` with a `main` method that sets two boolean variables `a` and `b` to the values true and false, respectively. It then prints out the results of performing logical AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`) operations on `a` and `b`, as well as printing the result of the NOT operation on `a`.
