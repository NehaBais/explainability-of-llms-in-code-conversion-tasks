 In Rust, you can use the bitwise operations like & (bitwise AND), | (bitwise OR), ^ (bitwise XOR), and ~ (bitwise NOT) directly on integers. For shifting operations, you have to specify the type as unsigned integer or else Rust will interpret it as a shift operation which is not what we want in this case. For rotations, there are no direct operators in Rust but bitwise manipulation can be used to achieve similar effect. Here's how you could convert the given code into Rust:

```rust
fn bitwise(a: i32, b: u32) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a & b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a | b);
    println!("a xor b: {}", a ^ b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);
    // Since the C language allows variable shifts, Rust can't enforce constant shift amounts.
    // As such, we'll just multiply `b` by the size of an integer in bytes to convert it into bit shifts.
    let byte_shift = std::mem::size_of::<i32>() * 8;
    println!("a << n: {}", a << (b as i32 * byte_shift)); // left shift
    println!("a >> n: {}", a >> (b as i32 * byte_shift)); // right shift, no rotate equivalent in C
    let c = a as u32; 
    println!("c >> b: {}", c >> b); // right rotate equivalent for unsigned integer
}
```
This Rust code does the same operations as your original C code but note that this version of code is not guaranteed to work on all platforms, specifically those where shifting a negative number results in undefined behavior like some 2's complement systems. This code also relies on conversion of integers to unsigned for the correct interpretation of `>>` operator. The rotate operation is done using arithmetic right shift (which will sign-extend the value) and bitwise OR with the mask equivalent to left rotation.
