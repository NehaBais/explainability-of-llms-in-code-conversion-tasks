Here's a Golang implementation of the `mkdirp` function that achieves the same behavior as the Python code:
```
import "os"
func mkdirp(path string) error {
 return os.MkdirAll(path, 0755)
}
```
In this implementation, we use the `os.MkdirAll` function to create the directory and any missing parents. The third argument `0755` sets the permissions of the created directory to read-write-execute for owner and read-only for group and others. You can adjust these permissions as needed.
The `mkdirp` function returns an error if the directory cannot be created or if a parent directory is not found. If the directory already exists, it returns nil without failing. This behavior is similar to the `exist_ok=True` argument in Python's `os.makedirs`.
Note that this implementation uses the standard library package "os" instead of "path/filepath", so it may not work on Windows systems. If you need a cross-platform solution, you may need to use a third-party library or write your own code to handle platform-specific directory creation logic.
