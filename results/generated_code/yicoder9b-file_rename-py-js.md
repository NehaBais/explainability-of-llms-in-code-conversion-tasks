In JavaScript for renaming files and directories you can use the built-in 'fs' module:

Here is how it could be done:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

try {
  // Rename file in current working directory
  fs.renameSync("input.txt", "output.txt"); 
  
  // Rename directory in current working directory
  fs.renameSync("docs", "mydocs");

  // For renaming files and directories at the filesystem root you need to use process.env.HOME or __dirname (the directory of the currently executing script)
  fs.renameSync(process.env.HOME + "/input.txt", process.env.HOME + "/output.txt"); 
  fs.renameSync(process.env.HOME + "/docs", process.env.HOME + "/mydocs");
  
  // For renaming directories in the root directory.
  fs.renameSync(__dirname + '/input.txt', __dirname + '/output.txt'); 
  fs.renameSync(__dirname + '/docs', __dirname + '/mydocs'); 
} catch (error) {
  console.log("An error occurred: ", error);
}
```
Please note that JavaScript doesn't have a direct equivalent to Python's os.sep which automatically finds the correct path separator for the current operating system. This code assumes that '/' is used as the root directory in your file system. If it differs you may need to adjust accordingly.
