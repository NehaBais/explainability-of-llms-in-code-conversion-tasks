 Certainly! Below is the Rust code that performs the same operations as your C++ code:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    println!("Enter two integers:");
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
    
    let values: Vec<i32> = input.trim()
        .split_whitespace()
        .map(|s| s.parse().unwrap())
        .collect();
    
    let a = values[0];
    let b = values[1];
    
    println!("a + b = {}", a + b);
    println!("a - b = {}", a - b);
    println!("a * b = {}", a * b);
    
    // For quotient and remainder, we need to handle the division differently in Rust.
    // The "/" operator performs integer division towards zero.
    let quotient = a / b;
    let remainder = a % b;
    println!("a / b = {}, remainder {}", quotient, remainder);
    
    // Check if exponentiation is supported by the standard library (it's not)
    // If you need to support it, consider using a crate like `num-traits` or `nalgebra`.
}
```

This Rust code reads two integers from the user, performs the specified operations, and prints the results. Note that Rust does not have an exponentiation operator built into the standard library, so if you need to support it (e.g., for floating-point exponents), you would need to import a crate or implement it manually.
