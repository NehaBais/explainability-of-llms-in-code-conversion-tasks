The equivalent C++ code for the given Rust program is as follows: 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string s = "hello";
    std::cout << s << std::endl;
    
    s += " world";
    std::cout << s << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
This C++ code does exactly the same as the given Rust program: it creates a string variable and prints its content, then concatenates another string literal to the original string variable and also prints it.
