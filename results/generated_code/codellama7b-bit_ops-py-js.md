This code performs various bitwise operations on two integers, a bitwise NOT on the first integer, and shifts and rotates. Here's an explanation of what each function does:

* `bitwise_built_ins`: This function takes three parameters: `width`, `a`, and `b`. It performs bitwise AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and XOR (`^`) operations on the two integers, using masking to ensure that the result is within the given width. It also performs a bitwise NOT operation on the first integer, using the same masking technique.
* `rotr`: This function takes three parameters: `width`, `a`, and `n`. It performs a right rotation of the integer `a` by `n` bits. The rotation is done modulo `width`.
* `rotl`: This function takes three parameters: `width`, `a`, and `n`. It performs a left rotation of the integer `a` by `n` bits. The rotation is done modulo `width`.
* `asr`: This function takes three parameters: `width`, `a`, and `n`. It performs an arithmetic shift right operation on the integer `a` by `n` bits. The shift is done modulo `width`. If the result of the shift would be a negative number, it is masked to 0.
* `helper_funcs`: This function takes two parameters: `width`, and `a`. It performs various bitwise operations on the integer `a`, using the same masking technique as in `bitwise_built_ins`. It also performs various rotations and shifts of the integer `a` by modulo `width`.
* `__main__`: This is the main function of the program. It calls the `bitwise_built_ins` and `helper_funcs` functions with different parameters, demonstrating their use.
