Here is the Python code that fulfills the given requirements:
```
s = "hello"
s2 = s + " literal"
print(s)
print(s2)
```
In this code, we first create a string variable `s` and assign it the value `"hello"`. Then, we create another string variable `s2` by concatenating `s` with the string literal `" literal"`. Finally, we print the contents of both variables using the `print()` function.
