Here is your Python code converted to Java:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "12345678";
        s = "0" + s;  // by concatenation
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```

This Java program does the same thing as your Python code - it declares a string variable `s`, assigns it the value of "12345678", prepends "0" to it using string concatenation, and then prints out the resulting string.
