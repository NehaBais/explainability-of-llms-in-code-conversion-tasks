To convert the Rust code to Python, you can use the `os` module in Python. Here's an example of how to do this:
```
import os

def main():
    for file in ["input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", "/docs"]:
        if os.path.exists(file):
            if os.path.isdir(file):
                print(f"{file} is a directory")
            else:
                print(f"{file} is a file")
        else:
            print(f"{file} does not exist")
```
Note that in Python, the `os.path` module provides functions for working with file paths and directories. The `exists` function checks if a file or directory exists, while the `isdir` function checks if the path is a directory. The `print` statement is used to print messages to the console.

Also note that in Python, you can use a string literal to represent a file path, and you don't need to explicitly create an iterator for the list of files.

Please let me know if this helps or if you have any further questions!
