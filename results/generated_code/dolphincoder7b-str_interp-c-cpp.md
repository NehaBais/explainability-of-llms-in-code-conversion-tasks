The equivalent code in C++ is as follows:
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    string extra = "little";
    cout << "Mary had a " << extra << " lamb." << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
The major difference between the two languages is that in C++ strings are built with concatenations using the `+` operator, whereas in C we use the `printf` function to print out the string. The other significant difference is that C++ has a more robust and powerful syntax for string manipulation than C.
