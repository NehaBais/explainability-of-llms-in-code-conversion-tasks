Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your Python code:

```javascript
let s = "12345678";
s = "0" + s; // by concatenation
console.log(s);
```
This JavaScript code does exactly what your Python code does. It declares a string variable `s` with the value of "12345678". Then it prepends the string literal "0" to the string variable `s`, and assigns the result back to the variable `s`. Finally, it logs the new value of the string variable `s` to the console.
