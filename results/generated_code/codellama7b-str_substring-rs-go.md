Sure, I can help you with that! Here's the conversion of the Rust code to Go:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	// String to be processed
	s := "abc文字化けdef"

	// Length of the string
	n := len(s)

	// Starting position for substring extraction
	m := 3

	// Print the first three characters starting from index 2 (c文字)
	fmt.Println(string([]rune(s)[2:5]))

	// Print the entire string starting from index 2 (c文字化けdef)
	fmt.Println(string([]rune(s)[2:]))

	// Print the string except the last character (abc文字化けde)
	fmt.Println(strings.TrimSuffix(s, string([]rune(s)[n-1])))

	// Print the first three characters starting from 'b' (bc文)
	cpos := strings.Index(s, "b")
	fmt.Println(string([]rune(s)[cpos+1 : cpos+4]))

	// Print the first three characters starting from "けd" (けde)
	spos := strings.Index(s, "けd")
	fmt.Println(string([]rune(s)[spos+1 : spos+4]))
}
```
The `strings` package provides some useful functions for working with strings in Go, such as `TrimSuffix`, which removes the last character from a string, and `Index`, which returns the index of a substring within a string.

In this code, we first define the input string `s` and its length `n`. Then, we extract different substrings using various methods in Go, including:

* The `string([]rune(s)[2:5])` expression, which returns the first three characters of the string starting from index 2 (the second character).
* The `string([]rune(s)[2:])` expression, which returns the entire string starting from index 2.
* The `strings.TrimSuffix(s, string([]rune(s)[n-1]))` expression, which removes the last character of the string and returns the remaining characters.
* The `string([]rune(s)[cpos+1 : cpos+4])` expression, which returns the first three characters of the string starting from the position of the 'b' character (which is located at index 3).
* The `string([]rune(s)[spos+1 : spos+4])` expression, which returns the first three characters of the string starting from the position of the "けd" substring (which is located at index 6).

Note that in Go, we use the `strings.Index` function to find the position of a substring within a string, and then slice the string using the `string([]rune(s)[start:end])` expression to extract the desired substrings.
