The equivalent Python code would be:

```python
def main():
    hello = "Hello world"
    print(f"{hello}!!!!")

main()
```

Python does not have a built-in method to add two strings, but you can achieve this using the '+' operator or the `format()` function. In Python 3.6 and later versions, f-strings are a convenient way of including expressions inside string literals for formatting.
