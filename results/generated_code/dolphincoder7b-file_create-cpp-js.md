Below is the JavaScript code that performs the same task as the provided C++ code:

```javascript
let fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function createFilesAndDirectories() {
    // Create an empty file called output.txt in the current directory and the filesystem root
    fs.writeFileSync('./output.txt', '');
    fs.writeFileSync('/output.txt', '');

    // Create an empty directory named 'docs' in the current directory and the filesystem root
    fs.mkdirSync('docs');
    fs.mkdirSync('/docs');
}
```

Note: The `fs` module in Node.js is used to perform file system operations such as writing files, creating directories, etc., while the `path` module is used for parsing paths. This code creates a file named "output.txt" in the current directory and in the filesystem root, and creates an empty directory called "docs" in both locations.
