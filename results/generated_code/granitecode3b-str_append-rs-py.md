Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task:
```python
hello = "Hello world" + "!!!!"
print(hello)
``` 
This code creates a string variable called `hello` and assigns it the value of "Hello world". It then uses the `+` operator to concatenate the string with the literal string "!!!!", resulting in the output "Hello world!!!!". The contents of the `hello` variable are shown using the `print()` function.
