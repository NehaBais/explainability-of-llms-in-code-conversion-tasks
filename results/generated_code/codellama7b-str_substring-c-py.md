 This is a C program that uses the `substring` function to extract various substrings from a given string. The `substring` function takes three arguments: the string to be processed, the starting index of the substring, and the length of the substring. It returns a pointer to a newly allocated memory block containing the substring.

Here is the Python equivalent of this C code:
```python
def substring(s, n, m):
    """
    Extract a substring from s, starting at index n and of length m.
    """
    if n < 0 or m < 0:
        return None
    start = n
    end = min(start + m, len(s))
    return s[start:end]

def str_wholeless1(s):
    """
    Extract the substring of s from the first character up to the penultimate.
    """
    return substring(s, 0, -1)

def str_fromch(s, ch, m):
    """
    Extract a substring starting with the first occurrence of ch and of length m.
    """
    start = s.find(ch)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = min(start + m, len(s))
    return s[start:end]

def str_fromstr(s, in, m):
    """
    Extract a substring starting with the first occurrence of in and of length m.
    """
    start = s.find(in)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = min(start + m, len(s))
    return s[start:end]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = "hello world shortest program"

    print(substring(s, 12, 5))	# get "short"
    print(substring(s, 6, -1))	# get "world shortest program"
    print(str_wholeless1(s))	# "... progra"
    print(str_fromch(s, 'w', 5))	# "world"
    print(str_fromstr(s, "ro", 3))	# "rog"
```
The Python code defines the `substring` function which takes a string and two integers as arguments. It returns a new substring starting at the specified index and of the specified length. The `str_wholeless1`, `str_fromch`, and `str_fromstr` functions are defined similarly, but they use the `substring` function to extract substrings from the input string.

The main part of the code demonstrates how to use these functions by calling them with different arguments and printing the results.
