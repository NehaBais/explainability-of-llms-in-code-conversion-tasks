The JavaScript version of the given C++ code can be written as follows:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function renameFile(oldPath, newPath) {
    try {
        if (fs.lstatSync(oldPath).isDirectory()) {
            // Rename directory
            fs.renameSync(oldPath, newPath);
        } else {
            // Rename file
            const dirName = path.dirname(newPath));
            if (!fs.existsSync(dirName))) {
                fs.mkdirSync(dirName, { recursive: true }));
            }
            fs.renameSync(oldPath, newPath);
        }
    } catch (err) {
        console.error("An error occurred while renaming the file:", err.message);
        return;
    }

    console.log("File successfully renamed from 'input.txt' to 'output.txt'.");
}

// Rename files/directories in the current working directory
renameFile('input.txt', 'output.txt');

// Rename files/directories in the filesystem root
const rootDir = '/';
renameFile(`${rootDir}input.txt`, `${rootDir}output.txt`);
renameFile(`${rootDir}docs`, `${rootDir}mydocs`);
```

This JavaScript code will rename the files and directories as specified in the C++ code. It uses Node.js built-in modules `fs` (for file system operations) and `path` (for working with file paths). The function `renameFile()` takes two arguments: the old path of the file or directory to be renamed, and the new path of the file or directory after being renamed.

The code first renames a file in the current working directory using the `fs.renameSync()` method. It then uses the same method to rename a directory.

To ensure that the directories are created recursively if they do not exist, the code uses the `fs.existsSync()` method to check if the directories already exist. If not, it creates them recursively using the `fs.mkdirSync()` method with the `{ recursive: true }` option.

Finally, the code outputs a success message indicating that the files and directories have been successfully renamed from their old names to their new names.
