 Here is the JavaScript version of your Java code:

```javascript
function logic(a, b) {
    console.log("a AND b: " + (a && b));
    console.log("a OR b: " + (a || b));
    console.log("NOT a: " + (!a));
}
```
This function does the exact same thing as your Java method - it takes in two boolean values, performs "and", "or" and "not" operations on them, and then logs the results to the console.
