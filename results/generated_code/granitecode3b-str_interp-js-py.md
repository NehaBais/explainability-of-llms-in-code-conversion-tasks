Here's the Python code that performs the same task as the JavaScript code you provided:
```python
original = "Mary had a X lamb"
little = "little"
replaced = original.replace("X", little) #changes the original string
print(replaced)
```
This code creates a new string called `replaced` by replacing all occurrences of "X" in the original string with the value of `little`. The original string is not changed because the `replace()` method returns a new string that does not affect the original string.
