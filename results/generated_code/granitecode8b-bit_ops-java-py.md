Here's the Python code that performs bitwise operations on two integers `a` and `b`:
```
def bitwise(a, b):
 print("a AND b:", a & b)
 print("a OR b:", a | b)
 print("a XOR b:", a ^ b)
 print("NOT a:", ~a)
 print("a << b:", a << b) # left shift
 print("a >> b:", a >> b) # arithmetic right shift
 print("a >>> b:", a >> b) # logical right shift
 print("a rol b:", (a << b) | (a >> (32 - b))) #rotate left, Python doesn't have built-in rotateLeft function
 print("a ror b:", (a >> b) | (a << (32 - b))) #rotate right, Python doesn't have built-in rotateRight function
``` 
Note that the Python code for rotation uses a bitwise OR to combine the shifted bits from both directions. This may not be the most efficient way to perform rotation in Python, but it should work correctly for small values of `b`.
