In Go language, the logical operators are `&&` for "and", `||` for "or" and `!` for not. So here's your C code converted to Golang:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func printLogic(a, b bool) {
	fmt.Println("a && b is", a && b)
   fmt.Println("a || b is", a || b)
   fmt<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>not a is", !a)
}
```

The `<s` notation in the last print statement is used to comment out that line, because Go does not support multiline comments with single-line syntax like C. If you need a more comprehensive explanation of what this function does, please ask!
