Here is the Python equivalent of your Java code:

```python
string = "abc"
print(string)
string += "def"
print(string)
```

This program creates a string variable `string` with value "abc". It then prints the current value of `string`. After that, it appends the string literal "def" to the end of `string`, and prints the new value of `string`.
