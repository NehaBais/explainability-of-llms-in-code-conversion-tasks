Here's how you can implement the `mkdirp` function in Rust using the `std::fs` module:
```
use std::fs;
use std::io;
fn mkdirp(path: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
 fs::create_dir_all(path)
}
```
This implementation uses the `std::fs::create_dir_all` function to create all directories in a given path, including any missing parent directories. The function returns a `io::Result`, which is an enum that can represent either a successful result or an error. If the directory already exists, the function will return successfully without doing anything.
