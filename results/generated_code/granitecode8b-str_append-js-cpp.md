Here's the converted code from JavaScript to C++ that meets the given requirements:
```
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 std::string s1 = "Hello";
 s1 += ", World!";
 std::cout << s1 << std::endl;
 return 0;
}
```
In this code, we first include the necessary headers for input/output and string manipulation. Then, we define a main function that returns an integer. Inside the main function, we create a string variable `s1` and initialize it with the value "Hello". We then append the string literal ", World!" to `s1` using the `+=` operator, which is the idiomatic way to append strings in C++. Finally, we print the contents of `s1` using `std::cout`, followed by a newline character to improve readability.
