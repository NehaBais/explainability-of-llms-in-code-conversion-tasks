Sure, here's the JavaScript code that converts the Java code you provided:
```javascript
function compareStrings(A, B) {
 if (A == B) {
 console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are lexically equal.`);
 } else {
 console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not lexically equal.`);
 }
 
 if (A.toLowerCase() == B.toLowerCase()) {
 console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are case-insensitive lexically equal.`);
 } else {
 console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.`);
 }

 const aNum = parseFloat(A);
 const bNum = parseFloat(B);
 
 if (isNaN(aNum) && isNaN(bNum)) {
 console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not numeric strings and can be compared as usual.`);
 } else if (!isNaN(aNum) && !isNaN(bNum)) {
 console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are numeric strings and must be parsed as numbers.`);
 } else if (aNum < bNum) {
 console.log(`'${A}' is lexically before '${B}'.`);
 } else if (aNum > bNum) {
 console.log(`'${A}' is lexically after '${B}'.`);
 } else {
 console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically before '${B}'.`);
 }
 
 if (aNum < bNum) {
 console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically after '${B}'.`);
 } else if (aNum > bNum) {
 console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically before '${B}'.`);
 } else {
 console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are numeric strings and can be compared normally.`);
 }
 
 console.log(`The lexical relationship is: ${A.localeCompare(B)}`);
 console.log(`The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: ${A.toLowerCase().localeCompare(B.toLowerCase())}`);
}
compareStrings("Hello", "Hello");
compareStrings("5", "5.0");
compareStrings("java", "Java");
compareStrings("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ");
compareStrings("ĴÃVÁ", "ĵãvá");
```
This code defines a function called `compareStrings` that takes two strings as arguments and performs the following comparisons:
- Lexical comparison: It checks if the strings are equal using the strict equality operator (`==`) and prints out the result.
- Case insensitive lexical comparison: It converts both strings to lowercase and then checks if they are equal using the `localeCompare` method, which handles case insensitivity.
- Numeric string comparison: It parses the strings as numbers using the `parseFloat` function and performs the comparison based on their numeric values.
- Lexical relationship: It uses the `localeCompare` method to determine the lexical relationship between the two strings and prints out the result.
- Case insensitive lexical relationship: It converts both strings to lowercase before performing the `localeCompare` operation, which handles case insensitivity.
Note that this code assumes that the input strings are valid and do not contain any errors or exceptions that could cause unexpected behavior.
