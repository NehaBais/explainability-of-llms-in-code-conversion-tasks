Here is the converted code from Python to C++ that verifies the size of a file called input.txt for a file in the current working directory and another one in the file system root:
```
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 std::string filename1 = "input.txt";
 std::string filename2 = "/input.txt";
 struct stat info1, info2;
 
 if (stat(filename1.c_str(), &info1) != 0) {
 std::cerr << "Error getting file size for " << filename1 << std::endl;
 return 1;
 }
 
 if (stat(filename2.c_str(), &info2) != 0) {
 std::cerr << "Error getting file size for " << filename2 << std::endl;
 return 1;
 }
 
 std::cout << "File size for " << filename1 << ": " << info1.st_size << std::endl;
 std::cout << "File size for " << filename2 << ": " << info2.st_size << std::endl;
 
 return 0;
}
```
The code uses the `stat` function from the `sys/stat.h` header to retrieve information about the files. The `struct stat` type is used to store information about a file, such as its size. The `st_size` member of the `struct stat` type represents the size of the file in bytes.
