Here's the Python code that meets the requirements:
```
hello = "Hello world"
hello += "!!!!"
print(hello)
```
In this code, we first create a string variable `hello` and assign it the value `"Hello world"`. Then we use the `+=` operator to append the string literal `"!!!!"` to the end of the `hello` variable. Finally, we print the contents of the `hello` variable to verify that the append operation was successful.
