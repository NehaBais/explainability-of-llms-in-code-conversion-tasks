 To convert the given JavaScript code to C, we can use a library in C that provides file system operations. One such library is `libcmt` which is part of the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC). Below is an example of how you might achieve this using MFC in C++.

```cpp
#include <afx.h> // MFC core and standard components
#include <afxdisp.h> // MFC definitions for OLE automation classes

void RenameFilesAndFolders() {
    // Create a new instance of the FileSystemObject
    CFileSystem fso;

    try {
        // Move file in current working directory
        fso.MoveFile(_T("input.txt"), _T("output.txt"));

        // Move file in filesystem root
        fso.MoveFile(_T("c:/input.txt"), _T("c:/output.txt"));

        // Move folder in current working directory
        fso.MoveFolder(_T("docs"), _T("mydocs"));

        // Move folder in filesystem root
        fso.MoveFolder(_T("c:/docs"), _T("c:/mydocs"));
    } catch (CFileException* e) {
        // Handle exceptions if necessary
        e->ReportError();
        e->Delete();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Include MFC Headers**: The code includes `afx.h` and `afxdisp.h`, which are required for using MFC classes and functions.
2. **Create CFileSystem Instance**: A new instance of the `CFileSytem` class is created, which represents the file system object in MFC.
3. **Move File and Folder**: The methods `MoveFile` and `MoveFolder` are used to rename files and folders as specified. These methods take two arguments: the old name and the new name of the file or folder.
4. **Exception Handling**: If any error occurs during the operation, it is caught using a `CFileException` and reported.

### Notes:
- Ensure that you have an appropriate library linked to your project if you are using this code in a standalone application or within a larger software suite.
- The function assumes that the working directory contains `input.txt` and `docs`, and that the root directory contains `c:/input.txt` and `c:/docs`. If these files do not exist, an exception will be thrown.
- This example uses MFC classes, so it is specifically tailored for Windows applications using MFC. If you are working in a console application or need to use POSIX-style file operations, the approach would differ significantly.
