The equivalent Python code for the given Java code is as follows:

```python
import os

try:
    open("output.txt", "w+").close()  # Create a new empty file called output.txt in current directory
    open("/output.txt", "w+").close()  # Create a new empty file called output.txt in root filesystem
    os.mkdir("docs")  # Create an empty directory called docs in current directory
    os.mkdir("/")  # Create an empty directory called docs in root filesystem
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

In this Python code, we use the `open()` function to create new files and write data into them. The `close()` method is used to close the file after it's done writing. The `os` module is used for creating directories. We handle any exceptions that may occur during the file creation process with an `except` block. 

Note: Since this is a Java code conversion task, we assume that your Python environment already has the necessary modules and packages installed. If you want to use the `java.io.File` class in your Python program, you should import it using its full package name (`import java.io.File`). However, since this is a simple operation and doesn't require any complex file handling or I/O operations, we don't need to write specific code for creating files and directories.
