```python
import os

def rename_file(oldname, newname):
    # Rename file (or directory)
    success = os.rename(oldname, newname)
    return success

def test(type_, oldname, newname):
    print("The following {} called {} {}".format(
        type_,
        oldname,
        "was renamed as" if rename_file(oldname, newname) else "could not be renamed into",
        newname
    ))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt")
    test("file", os.path.join(os.sep, "input.txt"), os.path.join(os.sep, "output.txt"))
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs")
    test("directory", os.path.join(os.sep, "docs"), os.path.join(os.sep, "mydocs"))
```

Note that in Python the `os` module provides functionality equivalent to Java's File class and operating system features. 

The `os.rename` method is used to rename file or directory.

The `os.path.join` function is used to get the path of a file/directory by joining one or more path components. In this case, it's being used to create paths that start with a `/`, which represents the root directory in Unix-like operating systems (including Linux and macOS). 

Please note that you have to run these commands as an admin to successfully rename files or directories in Python. The same is true for Java.
