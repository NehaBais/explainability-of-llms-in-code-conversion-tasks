Here's the Rust code that implements the same functionality as the given Java code:
```
fn compare(A: &str, B: &str) {
    if A == B {
        println!("{} and {} are lexically equal.", A, B);
    } else {
        println!("{} and {} are not lexically equal.", A, B);
    }

    if A.to_lowercase() == B.to_lowercase() {
        println!("{} and {} are case-insensitive lexically equal.", A, B);
    } else {
        println!("{} and {} are not case-insensitive lexically equal.", A, B);
    }

    match A.cmp(B) {
        std::cmp::Ordering::Less => println!("{} is lexically before {}", A, B),
        std::cmp::Ordering::Greater => println!("{} is lexically after {}", A, B),
        _ => (),
    }

    match A.cmp(B) {
        std::cmp::Ordering::Greater | std::cmp::Ordering::Equal => println!("{} is not lexically before {}", A, B),
        _ => (),
    }

    match A.cmp(B) {
        std::cmp::Ordering::Less | std::cmp::Ordering::Equal => println!("{} is not lexically after {}", A, B),
        _ => (),
    }

    println!("The lexical relationship is: {}", A.cmp(B));
    println!("The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: {}", A.to_lowercase().cmp(&B.to_lowercase()));
}
fn main() {
    compare("Hello", "Hello");
    compare("5", "5.0");
    compare("java", "Java");
    compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ");
    compare("Ĵãº", "ĵãº");
}
```
This code implements the same functionality as the given Java code by using the `==` operator to compare two strings for exact equality, the `.ne()` method to compare two strings for inequality, and the `cmp()` method to compare two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other. The `cmp()` method also provides a way to handle comparison of numeric strings that are not treated lexically.
