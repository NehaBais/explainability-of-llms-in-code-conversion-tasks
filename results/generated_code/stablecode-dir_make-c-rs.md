Rust doesn't have a direct equivalent to the C library function `mkdir`, which creates a directory. However, you can use the Rust standard library's functionality to accomplish this task.

Here is a possible implementation in Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn create_directory(path: &str) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
    let path = fs::Path::new(path);

    if let Some(parent) = path.parent() {
        fs::create_dir_all(parent)?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

This implementation uses the `std::fs` module in Rust's standard library to create directories and any missing parents. The function takes a single path string as input, creates all necessary parent directories using `std::fs::create_dir_all`, and returns an error if something goes wrong during the process.
