Sure! Here's the converted code in Java:
```
import java.io.*;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory called "docs".
        try {
            Files.createFile(Paths.get("output.txt"));
            Files.createDirectory(Paths.get("docs"));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
            System.exit(1);
        }
    }
}
```
Note that in Java, we can create a new file and directory using the `Files.createFile()` and `Files.createDirectory()` methods from the `java.nio.file` package. These methods take in a `Path` object as an argument, which represents the file system path of the file or directory to be created.

In this code, we create two directories: one called "docs" in the current working directory and another called "output.txt" in the root directory. We use `Paths.get()` to get a `Path` object for each directory, and then pass these objects to the `Files.createDirectory()` and `Files.createFile()` methods to create the directories and file.

If an exception is thrown during the creation of the directories or files, we print an error message to standard error using `System.err.println()`, and exit the program with a non-zero status code using `System.exit(1)`.
