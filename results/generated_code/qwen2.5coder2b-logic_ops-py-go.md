In Go, you can use the logical operators directly without importing the `boolean` package. Here is how you could write this code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func logic(a bool, b bool) {
    fmt.Printf("a and b: %v\n", a && b)
    fmt.Printf("a or b: %v\n", a || b)
    fmt.Printf("not a: %v\n", !a)
}

func main() {
    logic(true, true)
}
```

This code uses the logical AND (`&&`), OR (`||`) and NOT operators directly. The `fmt.Printf` function is used to print the results of these operations. In Go, if you don't specify a type for a variable, it will be inferred based on its value.

Note that in this case, the values `true` are passed as arguments to the `logic` function. When you run the `main` function, it calls the `logic` function with these arguments and prints out the results of the AND, OR, and NOT operations.
