Rust's standard library does not provide a direct way to rename files or directories like C++ std::rename function does. The Rust standard library only provides the `std::fs::rename()` method which is used for renaming files, and it can only handle file paths relative to the current working directory.

However, you can use external crates that provide file manipulation functionality in Rust such as `tokio::fs` or `std::fs`. Here is an example of how to do this with `std::fs`:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Rename files and directories in the current working directory
    let here_input = "input.txt";
    let here_output = "output.txt";
    let here_docs = "docs";
    let here_mydocs = "mydocs";

    fs::rename(here_input, here_output)?;
    fs::rename(here_docs, here_mydocs)?;

    // Rename files and directories in the root directory
    let root_input = "/input.txt";
    let root_output = "/output.txt";
    let root_docs = "/docs";
    let root_mydocs = "/mydocs";

    #[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
    {
        fs::rename(root_input, root_output)?;
        fs::rename(root_docs, root_mydocs)?;
    }
    #[cfg(not(target_os = "windows"))]
    {
        println!("Renaming files and directories in the root directory is not supported on non-Windows systems.");
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

The above code checks if the system is Windows or not. If it's not a Windows system, it doesn't attempt to rename files or directories in the root directory because they are protected by the operating system.

Note: This will fail with `Permission denied` error if you don't have write permissions for those directories/files.
