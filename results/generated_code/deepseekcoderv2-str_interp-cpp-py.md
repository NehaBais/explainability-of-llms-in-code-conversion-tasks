 Here's the equivalent Python code for the given C++ code:

```python
original = "Mary had a X lamb."
toBeReplaced = "X"
replacement = "little"

# Find and replace the substring
newString = original.replace(toBeReplaced, replacement)

print("String after replacement:", newString)
```

This Python code performs string interpolation by replacing the specified substring `"X"` with `"little"` in the original string `"Mary had a X lamb."`.
