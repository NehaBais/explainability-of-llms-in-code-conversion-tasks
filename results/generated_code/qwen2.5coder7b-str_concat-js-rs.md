Here's how you can convert the given JavaScript code into Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    println!("{} there!", s);
}
```

This Rust code does exactly what your JavaScript code does. It first creates a string variable `s` with the value "hello". Then it prints out the content of `s` followed by another string literal " there!".
