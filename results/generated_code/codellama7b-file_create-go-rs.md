This code creates a new file called "output.txt" and an empty directory called "docs" in the current working directory, as well as two identical copies of each in the root filesystem.

The following is the equivalent Rust code:
```
fn main() {
    create_file("input.txt");
    create_file("/input.txt");
    create_dir("docs");
    create_dir("/docs");
}

fn create_file(fn: &str) {
    match fs::File::create(fn) {
        Ok(f) => println!("file {} created!", fn),
        Err(e) => println!("error: {}", e),
    }
}

fn create_dir(dn: &str) {
    match fs::Dir::new(dn, 0666) {
        Ok(_) => println!("directory {} created!", dn),
        Err(e) => println!("error: {}", e),
    }
}
```
As you can see, the code in Rust is much more straightforward than the one in Golang. In order to create a new file or directory in the current working directory, we use the fs::File::create() and fs::Dir::new() functions, respectively. The first argument of these methods is the name of the file or directory that will be created.

The second argument of fs::Dir::new() is the permission mode, which specifies the read/write permissions for the new directory. In this case, we have specified 0666 as the value of the permission mode.

Once we create the file or directory, we use println!() to print a message indicating that it has been created successfully. If there is an error creating the file or directory, we print an error message instead.
