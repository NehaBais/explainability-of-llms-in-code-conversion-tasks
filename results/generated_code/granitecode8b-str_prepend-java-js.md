Here's the converted code in JavaScript:
```
let string = "def";
string = "abc" + string;
```
This code creates a string variable called `string` and assigns it the value `"def"`. Then, it prepends the string with another string literal, `"abc"`, by using the concatenation operator (`+`). The resulting string is `"abcdef"`.
