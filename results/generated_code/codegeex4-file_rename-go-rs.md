Rust's standard library does not provide a direct equivalent of Golang's `os.Rename` function. We need to use the filesystem module, specifically the `std::fs::rename` function. Below is the equivalent code in Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").expect("Unable to move file");
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").expect("Unable to move directory");

    // Since we need permissions to rename files and directories in the root,
    // we will have to run this program with sudo (or as root) on Unix-based systems.
    fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt").expect("Unable to move file");
    fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs").expect("Unable to move directory");
}
```

Please note that renaming files and directories in the root directory (`/`) requires appropriate permissions. Therefore, you will likely need to run this program with sudo (or as a root user) on Unix-based systems.

Also, it's important to handle errors when performing operations like renaming files or directories, which is why we use `expect` to cause a panic if an error occurs. In a production environment, you'd likely want to handle these errors more gracefully.
