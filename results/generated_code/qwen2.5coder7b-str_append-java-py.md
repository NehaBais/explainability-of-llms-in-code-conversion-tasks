Here is your Java code converted to Python:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
string = "abc"

# Show the contents of the variable before the append operation
print(string)

# Append another string literal to the existing string in Python
string += "def"

# Show the contents of the variable after the append operation
print(string)
```

The code above is written in a very similar way to your Java example, as Python also uses the `+=` operator for appending strings. The print statements show the contents of the variable before and after the string has been appended.
