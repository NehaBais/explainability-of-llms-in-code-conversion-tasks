Golang doesn't have a built-in function for renaming files or directories like Java does. The os package provides functions such as os.Rename which can be used to rename files or directories in Golang. 
Here is the Go equivalent of your code with same functionality:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func rename(oldName string, newName string) error {
	return os.Rename(oldName, newName)
}

func test(typeName string, oldName string, newName string) {
	err := rename(oldName, newName)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Could not rename the %s called %s to %s\n", typeName, oldName, newName)
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("%s %s successfully renamed to %s\n", typeName, oldName, newName)
	}
}

func main()  {
	test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt")
	test("directory", "docs", "mydocs")
}
```
Please replace `"input.txt"` and `"output.txt"` with the actual paths of your input and output files respectively in order to make this program work for you. Make sure that they exist before running it, otherwise os.Rename will throw an error. 

Note: The working directory is usually the directory where the Go file resides, if you want to rename files/directories from a different location like filesystem root then you would need to provide complete path starting from root(/). For example - "/input.txt" and "/docs". This code does not handle error for cases when provided paths do not exist or there is insufficient permissions to access them.
