Here's the equivalent code in JavaScript:
```
let s = "hello";
console.log(s);

let s1 = s + " world";
console.log(s1);
```
In this code, we declare a string variable `s` and assign it the value of the string literal `"hello"`. We then print its content to the console using `console.log()`.
Next, we create another string variable `s1` by concatenating the original `s` with the string literal `" world"`. We then print the content of both variables to the console.
