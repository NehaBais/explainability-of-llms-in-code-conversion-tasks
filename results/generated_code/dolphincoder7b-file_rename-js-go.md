The following is the equivalent Golang code:
```go
package main
import (
    "os"
)
func main() {
    os.Rename("./input.txt", "./output.txt")
    os.Rename("/path/to/input.txt", "/path/to/output.txt")
    os.Rename("docs", "mydocs")
    os.Rename("/path/to/docs", "/path/to/mydocs")
}
```
Explanation:
- `os` is a built-in package in Golang that provides functionality for file system manipulation and I/O operations.
- The `os.Rename()` function is used to rename files or directories. In the given code, it renames the files "input.txt" into "output.txt", moves it from the current directory to the root of the filesystem, and then renames the folder "docs" to "mydocs".
- Similarly, it also performs these operations for the given path "/path/to".
Note: The `os` package does not provide a direct function to rename directories. Instead, we can use the `os.Rename()` function along with the directory separator `"/"` to achieve this.
