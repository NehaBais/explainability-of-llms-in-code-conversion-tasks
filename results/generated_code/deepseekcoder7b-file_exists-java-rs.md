Rust doesn't have direct equivalent to Java's `File` class, but it has `std::fs::metadata` which can be used to check the existence of a file or directory.

Here is how you would translate your Java code into Rust:

To check for current working directory files and directories:
```rust
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
use std::fs;

fn exists_in_current_dir(filename: &str) -> bool {
    let path = Path::new(filename);
    path.exists() && path.is_file() // or .is_dir() for directory check
}

fn exists_in_root(filename: &str) -> bool {
    let path = PathBuf::from("/");  // Root of the FS
    path.push(filename);             // Append filename to it.
    
    match fs::metadata(path) {       // Get metadata for that file or directory.
        Ok(_) => true,               // If no error occurred, then we found a file/directory.
        Err(_) => false,             // Else (e.g., file not existent), it didn't find the file/directory.
    }
}

fn main() {
    assert!(exists_in_current_dir("input.txt")); 
    assert!(exists_in_current_dir("docs"));      
    assert!(exists_in_root("input.txt")); 
    assert!(exists_in_root("docs"));      
}
```
The `assert` statements are there to ensure the file/directory exists in the current working directory, you can delete them if they're not necessary for your program.

Again, remove those `assert` statements if they're not necessary for your program. This code will work assuming that you have the required permissions to read files and directories in the filesystem root directory.
