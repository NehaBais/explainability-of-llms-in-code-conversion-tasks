Golang doesn't have a built-in function for the `rename()` system call, but it provides an API to manipulate the filesystem in various ways. Here is how you can rename or move files and directories in Golang:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
    // Rename file/directory within current working directory 
	err := os.Rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("File successfully renamed.")
	}

	err = os.Rename("docs", "mydocs")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Directory successfully renamed.")
	}
    
    // Rename file/directory within the filesystem root 
    err = os.Rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("File successfully renamed in root directory.")
	}

	err = os.Rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Directory successfully renamed in root directory.")
	}
}
```

You need to have the correct permissions to perform these operations, otherwise you will get an error. Note that `/` before file names denotes they are at the filesystem root level. Also keep in mind that `os.Rename()` will only work if the new name does not already exist or is a directory.
