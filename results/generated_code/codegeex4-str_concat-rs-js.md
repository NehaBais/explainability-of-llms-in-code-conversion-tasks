Here is your requested code converted from Rust to JavaScript:

```javascript
// Create a string variable equal to any text value.
let s = "hello";

console.log(s);

// Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal.
let s1 = s + ' world';

console.log(s1);
```

This code does exactly what your Rust version does: it declares a string `s` equal to "hello", and then prints it. It then creates a new string `s1` that is the result of concatenating `s` with the string ' world', and finally, it prints this new string.
