Sure, here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given function:
```
function logic(a, b) {
  console.log(`a AND b: ${a && b}`);
  console.log(`a OR b: ${a || b}`);
  console.log(`NOT a: ${!a}`);
}
```
The equivalent JavaScript code is similar to the Java code in terms of syntax, but it uses a different operator for logical "and" and "or". It also uses the "!" operator to perform the "not" operation on the first argument.
