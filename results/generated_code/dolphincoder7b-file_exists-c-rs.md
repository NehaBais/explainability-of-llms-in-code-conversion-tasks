Rust does not have built-in support for checking file or directory existence or permissions. However, the `std::fs` module in Rust provides the necessary functionality to verify if a file or directory exists and check its type (regular file or directory). The following code shows how to use these methods to implement the given functionality:
```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

fn main() {
    let cwd = Path::new(".");

    // Check if input.txt exists and is a regular file
    let input_file_path = cwd.join("input.txt");
    match fs::metadata(&input_file_path) {
        Ok(meta) => println!("{:?} is a regular file? {}", &input_file_path, meta.is_file()),
        Err(_) => eprintln!("File does not exist or could not be opened"),
    };

    // Check if docs exists and is a directory
    let dir_path = cwd.join("docs");
    match fs::metadata(&dir_path) {
        Ok(meta) => println!("{:?} is a directory? {}", &dir_path, meta.is_dir()),
        Err(_) => eprintln!("Directory does not exist or could not be opened"),
    };

    // Check if /input.txt exists and is a regular file
    let absolute_input_file_path = PathBuf::from("/").join("input.txt");
    match fs::metadata(&absolute_input_file_path) {
        Ok(meta) => println!("{:?} is a regular file? {}", &absolute_input_file_path, meta.is_file()),
        Err(_) => eprintln!("File does not exist or could not be opened"),
    };

    // Check if /docs exists and is a directory
    let absolute_dir_path = PathBuf::from("/").join("docs");
    match fs::metadata(&absolute_dir_path) {
        Ok(meta) => println!("{:?} is a directory? {}", &absolute_dir_path, meta.is_dir()),
        Err(_) => eprintln!("Directory does not exist or could not be opened"),
    };
}
```
Note that the `fs::metadata` function returns an error if the file or directory does not exist. If you want to handle this case separately, you can use the `fs::metadata_opt` function instead of `fs::metadata`. However, in this code, all errors are handled using the `match` statement and `eprintln!`, which prints the error message to stderr.
This code also uses the `PathBuf` struct from the `std::path` module, which represents a path as a vector of components instead of a single string. The `join` method is used to concatenate the current working directory with the input file or directory names to obtain their absolute paths.
