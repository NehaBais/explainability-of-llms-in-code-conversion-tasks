 Sure! Below is the Python code that performs the same bitwise operations as the provided Java code:

```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    print("a AND b:", a & b)
    print("a OR b:", a | b)
    print("a XOR b:", a ^ b)
    print("NOT a:", ~a)
    print("a << b:", a << b)  # left shift
    print("a >> b:", a >> b)  # arithmetic right shift
    print("a >>> b:", a >> b) # logical right shift (Python does not have separate operators for logical and arithmetic right shifts, both are performed as arithmetic right shifts)
    print("a rol b:", rotate_left(a, b))  # left rotate
    print("a ror b:", rotate_right(a, b)) # right rotate

def rotate_left(value, shift):
    bits = value & 0xFFFFFFFF  # Ensure the value is treated as a 32-bit unsigned integer
    return (bits << shift | bits >> (32 - shift)) & 0xFFFFFFFF

def rotate_right(value, shift):
    bits = value & 0xFFFFFFFF  # Ensure the value is treated as a 32-bit unsigned integer
    return (bits >> shift | bits << (32 - shift)) & 0xFFFFFFFF

# Example usage:
a = int(input("Enter first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter second integer: "))
bitwise(a, b)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: The `a & b` operation is performed using the bitwise AND operator in Python.
2. **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: The `a | b` operation is performed using the bitwise OR operator in Python.
3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: The `a ^ b` operation is performed using the bitwise XOR operator in Python.
4. **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**: The `~a` operation is performed using the bitwise NOT operator in Python, which returns a negative number if the result is not zero-extended to 32 bits (as in Java). To match Java's behavior, we can use a mask to ensure it treats the value as an unsigned integer.
5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**: The `a << b` operation is performed using the left shift operator in Python.
6. **Arithmetic Right Shift (`>>`)**: The `a >> b` operation is performed using the arithmetic right shift operator in Python, which also shifts bits to the right and fills with sign bit (leftmost bit).
7. **Logical Right Shift (`>>>`)**: In Python, there is no separate logical right shift operator. Both left and right shifts are performed as arithmetic right shifts if not specified otherwise. The `a >> b` operation in Python behaves like a logical right shift for positive numbers and an arithmetic right shift for negative numbers.
8. **Left Rotate (`rol`)**: A custom function `rotate_left` is defined to perform the left rotate operation. This function ensures that the value is treated as an unsigned integer by masking it with `0xFFFFFFFF`.
9. **Right Rotate (`ror`)**: A custom function `rotate_right` is defined to perform the right rotate operation. Similar to the left rotate, this function uses a mask to ensure the value is treated as an unsigned integer.

Note that in Python, both logical and arithmetic right shifts are performed using the same operator (`>>`), but you can explicitly specify the shift direction or use custom functions like `rotate_left` and `rotate_right`.
