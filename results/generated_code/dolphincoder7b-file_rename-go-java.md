Java does not have built-in support for file renaming like in Golang. However, you can use the FileSystem API to achieve this using Java. Here is an example of how you can do it:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Rename a file "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the current working directory
        File input = new File("input.txt");
        if (input.exists()) {
            boolean renamed = input.renameTo(new File("output.txt"));
            System.out.println("File rename operation " + (renamed ? "succeeded." : "failed."));
        }

        // Rename a directory "docs" to "mydocs" in the current working directory
        File docsDir = new File("docs");
        if (docsDir.exists()) {
            boolean renamed = docsDir.renameTo(new File("mydocs"));
            System.out.println("Directory rename operation " + (renamed ? "succeeded." : "failed."));
        }

        // Rename a file "/input.txt" to "/output.txt" in the filesystem root
        File inputRoot = new File("/input.txt");
        if (inputRoot.exists()) {
            boolean renamed = inputRoot.renameTo(new File("/output.txt"));
            System.out.println("File rename operation " + (renamed ? "succeeded." : "failed."));
        }

        // Rename a directory "/docs" to "/mydocs" in the filesystem root
        File docsDirRoot = new File("/docs");
        if (docsDirRoot.exists()) {
            boolean renamed = docsDirRoot.renameTo(new File("/mydocs"));
            System.out.println("Directory rename operation " + (renamed ? "succeeded." : "failed."));
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create `File` objects to represent the input and output files/directories using their respective pathnames as arguments to the constructor. We then check if these files or directories exist before attempting to rename them. The `renameTo()` method of the `File` class is used to rename a file or directory. If the renaming operation was successful, we print "succeeded" in the console; otherwise, we print "failed".

Note that the filesystem root is represented by a single forward slash ("/") at the start of the pathname. It is also possible to use Windows-style pathnames using backslashes ("\\"), but Java's FileSystem API does not support this format. If you need to work with files and directories on a Windows operating system, you will have to handle this specific case separately.

You can customize this code to meet your requirements. For example, you may want to add error handling or handle exceptions if the rename operation fails for any reason. You can also modify the output messages to provide more detailed information about the renaming operations and their outcomes.
