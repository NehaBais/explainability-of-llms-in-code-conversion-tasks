In Python, you can use the `str` module to work with strings and manipulate them in various ways. Here are the equivalent code snippets for each of the requirements you mentioned:

1. Display a substring:
```python
s = "abc文字化けdef"
n = 2
m = 3

# Print 3 characters starting at index 2 (c文字)
print(s[n:n+m])

# Print all characters starting at index 2 (c文字化けdef)
print(s[n:])

# Print all characters except the last (abc文字化けde)
print(s[:-1])

# Print 3 characters starting with 'b' (bc文)
cpos = s.find('b')
print(s[cpos:cpos+m])

# Print 3 characters starting with "けd" (けde)
spos = s.find("けd")
print(s[spos:spos+m])
```
Note that in Python, strings are iterable and can be sliced using indexes, just like arrays. The `chars()` method returns an iterator over the characters in a string, and the `skip()` and `take()` methods allow you to skip over certain number of elements and take only a specific number of elements from the iterator.

2. Display a substring:

s = "abc文字化けdef"
n = 2
m = 3

# Print 3 characters starting at index 2 (c文字)
print(s[n:n+m])

# Print all characters starting at index 2 (c文字化けdef)
print(s[n:])

# Print all characters except the last (abc文字化けde)
print(s[:-1])

# Print 3 characters starting with 'b' (bc文)
cpos = s.find('b')
print(s[cpos:cpos+m])

# Print 3 characters starting with "けd" (けde)
spos = s.find("けd")
print(s[spos:spos+m])

print(s[:-1])

# Print 3 characters starting with 'b' (bc文)
cpos = s.find('b')
print(s[cpos:cpos+m])

# Print 3 characters starting with "けd" (けde)
spos = s.find("けd")
print(s[spos:spos+m])
