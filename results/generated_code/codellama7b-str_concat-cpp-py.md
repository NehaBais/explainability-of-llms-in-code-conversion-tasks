To convert this code from C++ to Python, you can use the following syntax:
```
s = 'hello'
print(s + 'literal')
s2 = s + 'literal'
print(s2)
```
The first line creates a string variable `s` with the value `'hello'`. The second line prints the value of the `s` variable followed by the string literal `'literal'`, resulting in the output `helloliteral`.

The third line concatenates the `s` variable with the string literal `'literal'` and assigns the result to a new string variable `s2`. The fourth line prints the value of the `s2` variable, resulting in the output `hello literal`.
