 Sure, here is the equivalent Python code to verify that a file called `input.txt` and a directory called `docs` exist. This will be done twice for the current working directory and for the filesystem root.

```python
import os

def file_exists(path):
    print(path)
    if os.path.exists(path):
        if os.path.isdir(path):
            print(" is a directory")
        else:
            print(f" exists with a file size of {os.path.getsize(path)} bytes.")
    else:
        print(" does not exist")

# For the current working directory
file_exists("input.txt")
file_exists("zero_length.txt")
file_exists("docs/input.txt")
file_exists("docs/zero_length.txt")

# For the filesystem root (assuming you have permission to access these paths)
root_paths = ["C:\\", "D:\\"]  # Replace with appropriate root directories if applicable
for root in root_paths:
    file_exists(os.path.join(root, "input.txt"))
    file_exists(os.path.join(root, "zero_length.txt"))
    file_exists(os.path.join(root, "docs/input.txt"))
    file_exists(os.path.join(root, "docs/zero_length.txt"))
```

Note: 
1. The `file_exists` function is defined to check if the given path exists and whether it's a directory or has a non-zero size.
2. For checking paths in the filesystem root, you might need to specify appropriate root directories like `C:\\` or `D:\\`. Adjust these paths according to your system configuration.
