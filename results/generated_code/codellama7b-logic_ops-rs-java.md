In Rust, the code above defines a function named `boolean_ops` that takes two boolean values as input and performs logical operations on them. The function also prints the results of these operations to the console using println! statements.

Here is the equivalent code in Java:
```java
public class BooleanOps {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean_ops(true, true);
        boolean_ops(true, false);
        boolean_ops(false, true);
        boolean_ops(false, false);
    }

    public static void boolean_ops(boolean a, boolean b) {
        System.out.println("" + a + " and " + b + " -> " + (a && b));
        System.out.println("" + a + " or " + b + " -> " + (a || b));
        System.out.println("" + a + " xor " + b + " -> " + (a ^ b));
        System.out.println("not " + a + " -> " + !a);
    }
}
```
In Java, the code above defines a `BooleanOps` class with a main method that calls the `boolean_ops` function four times with different input values. The `boolean_ops` function takes two boolean arguments and performs logical operations on them using the &&, ||, ^ operators, respectively. It also uses the ! operator to perform the "not" operation on the first argument. Finally, it prints the results of these operations to the console using System.out statements.

Note that in Java, unlike Rust, we don't need to use explicit return types for functions like `boolean_ops`. The compiler can infer the return type based on the expression used in the function body. Also, Java doesn't have a println! statement like Rust, so we have to use System.out statements instead.
