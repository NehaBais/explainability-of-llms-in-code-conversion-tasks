Here is your Go code converted to Python:

```python
import string

def main():
    # Create a string variable equal to any text value
    s = "foobar"

    # Append the string variable with another string literal 
    # in the most idiomatic way.
    s += "bazqux"

    # Show the contents of the variable after the append operation.
    print(s)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This Python script does exactly what your Go code does. It first creates a string `s` with the value "foobar". Then it appends another string to `s`, making its final value "foobarbazqux". Finally, the script prints this final value to the console.
