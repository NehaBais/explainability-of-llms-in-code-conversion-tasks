The following JavaScript code achieves the same functionality as the Rust code:
```javascript
function main() {
  const A = "abc";
  const b = "Bac";

  if (A === b) {
    console.log("The strings are equal");
  }
  if (A !== b) {
    console.log("The strings are not equal");
  }
  if (A > b) {
    console.log("The first string is lexically after the second");
  }
  if (A < b) {
    console.log("The first string is lexically before the second");
  }
  if (A >= b) {
    console.log("The first string is not lexically before the second");
  }
  if (A <= b) {
    console.log("The first string is not lexically after the second");
  }

  // case-insensitive comparison
  let A2 = A.toUpperCase();
  let b2 = b.toUpperCase();

  if (A2 === b2) {
    console.log("Both strings are equal when ignoring case");
  }

  // repeat checks
}
```
In JavaScript, the strict equality operator (`===`) is used to check for both value and type equality. Strings are compared lexically in JavaScript because it does not have a built-in string comparison function that respects the Unicode order of characters. The `toUpperCase()` method is used for case-insensitive comparisons, which also results in lexical ordering when used on strings that consist only of alphabetical characters. Note that JavaScript does not have an equivalent to Rust's `AsciiExt` trait for performing ASCII-specific operations.
