The following C++ code does the same as your Java code. It is assumed that you have appropriate permissions to create and delete directories on the system root:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <filesystem>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;

bool renameFile(const std::string& oldname, const std::string& newname) {
    // File (or directory) with old name
    fs::path file(oldname);
    // File (or directory) with new name
    fs::path file2(newname);

    // Rename file (or directory)
    return fs::rename(file, file2);
}

void test(const std::string& type, const std::string& oldname, const std::string& newname) {
    std::cout << "The following " + type + " called " + oldname + 
                   (renameFile(oldname, newname) ? " was renamed as " : " Could not be renamed into ") +
                   newname + "." 
                << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
    test("file", "/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs");
    test("directory", "/docs/", "/mydocs/");

    return 0;
}
```

In this C++ code, we use the standard library's `<filesystem>` to handle file operations. The `rename()` function is used to rename files and directories. Note that in C++, paths are represented using the `std::string`.
