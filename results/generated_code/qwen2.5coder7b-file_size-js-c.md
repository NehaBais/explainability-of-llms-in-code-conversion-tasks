The C programming language does not have built-in support for working with files using ActiveX objects like JavaScript. However, you can use the Windows API functions to achieve this.
Here is an example of how you can verify the size of a file called "input.txt" for a file in the current working directory and another one in the file system root:
```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int getFileSize(const char* filePath)
{
    HANDLE hFile = CreateFile(filePath, GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, NULL);
    if (hFile == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
        printf("Error opening file: %s\n", filePath);
        return -1;
    }
    
    DWORD fileSizeHigh = 0;
    DWORD fileSizeLow = GetFileSize(hFile, &fileSizeHigh);
    if (fileSizeLow == INVALID_FILE_SIZE && GetLastError() != NO_ERROR) {
        printf("Error getting file size for %s\n", filePath);
        CloseHandle(hFile);
        return -1;
    }
    
    CloseHandle(hFile);
    return (int)(fileSizeHigh * 0x100000000 + fileSizeLow);
}

int main()
{
    int size = getFileSize("input.txt");
    if (size != -1) {
        printf("Size of 'input.txt' in current directory: %d bytes\n", size);
    }
    
    size = getFileSize("c:/input.txt");
    if (size != -1) {
        printf("Size of 'input.txt' at root of C drive: %d bytes\n", size);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code uses the CreateFile function to open the file and then uses GetFileSize to get its size. If there is an error opening or getting the size, it prints out an error message and returns -1. Otherwise, it closes the handle to the file and returns the size of the file.
Note that this code assumes that you are using a Windows environment where these functions are available. If you need to compile this code on another platform, you may need to use different functions or libraries to achieve the same functionality.
