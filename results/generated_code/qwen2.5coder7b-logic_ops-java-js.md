Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your Java function:

```javascript
function logic(a, b){
  console.log("a AND b: " + (a && b));
  console.log("a OR b: " + (a || b));
  console.log("NOT a: " + (!a));
}
```

This JavaScript function works the same way as your Java function. It takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which should be boolean values. Then it logs to the console the result of the logical AND operation (`a && b`), the logical OR operation (`a || b`), and the logical NOT operation on `a` (`!a`).
