In JavaScript, string interpolation is done using template literals denoted by backticks (` `). Here is the equivalent code in Javascript for your C code:

```javascript
let extra = "little";
console.log(`Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`);
```

In this JavaScript version, we use `${}` inside of the backticks to specify where variables should be interpolated in the string. The variable `extra` is replaced with its value when the log statement is executed.
