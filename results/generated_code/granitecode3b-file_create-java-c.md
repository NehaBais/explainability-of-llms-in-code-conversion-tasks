Here is the C code that accomplishes the same task as the Java code:
```c
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 FILE *fp;
 if((fp = fopen("output.txt", "w")) == NULL) {
 perror("error creating output.txt");
 return 1;
 }
 fclose(fp);
 
 if(mkdir("docs", S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH) == -1) {
 perror("error creating docs directory");
 return 1;
 }
 
 return 0;
}
```
In this C code, we use the `fopen()` function to create a new file called "output.txt" and write it in binary mode (`"w"`). We then close the file using the `fclose()` function.
Next, we use the `mkdir()` function to create a directory called "docs" with read/write permissions for owner and group (`S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG`), read-only permissions for others (`S_IROTH`), and executable permissions for everyone (`S_IXOTH`). We then return 0 if the operation is successful or non-zero if there is an error.
