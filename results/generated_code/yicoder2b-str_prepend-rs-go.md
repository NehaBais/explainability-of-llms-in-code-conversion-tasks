The equivalent Golang code would be:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
    s := "World"
    s = "Hello " + s
    fmt.Println(s)
}
```
In Golang, we use the `+` operator to concatenate strings together, instead of the `insert_str()` method in Rust as there is no equivalent method for this operation in Golang.
