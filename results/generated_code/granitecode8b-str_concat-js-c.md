Here's the equivalent code in C:
```c
#include 
int main() {
 char* s = "hello";
 printf("%s there!", s);
 return 0;
}
```
This code creates a string variable `s` with the value "hello", and then uses `printf()` to print the value of `s` concatenated with the string literal " there!". The output will be "hello there!".
