In Python, you can use f-strings (formatted string literals)) for string interpolation similar to Java. Here's how you can convert the given Java code to Python:

```python
adjective = "little"
lyric = f"Mary had a {adjective} lamb"
```

In this Python code, we first define a variable `adjective` and assign it the value "little". Then, using an f-string, we interpolate the value of `adjective` into the string "Mary had a {adjective} lamb". The result is stored in the `lyric` variable.
