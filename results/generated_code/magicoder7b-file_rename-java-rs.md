 Rust doesn't have a built-in method for renaming directories or files like Java does. However, we can use the standard library `std::fs::rename` function to rename a file in Rust. The code would look something like this:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn rename_file(oldname: &str, newname: &str) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
    fs::rename(oldname, newname)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn test(typ: &str, oldname: &str, newname: &str) {
    match rename_file(oldname, newname) {
        Ok(_) => println!("The file called {} was renamed as {}", oldname, newname),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("The file called {} could not be renamed into {}: {:?}", oldname, newname, e),
    }
}

fn main() {
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
    test("file", "/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs");
    test("directory", "/docs/", "/mydocs/");
}
```
Please note that the full paths ("/input.txt" instead of "input.txt") are used to reference files and directories in the root directory, as Rust considers the current working directory to be at the root level by default.
