Sure, here's the JavaScript code that verifies the existence of a file called input.txt and a directory called docs in both the current working directory and the filesystem root:
```javascript
// Verifying file and directory existance in the current working directory
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const cwd = process.cwd(); // Get the current working directory
const inputFilePath = path.join(cwd, 'input.txt');
const docsPath = path.join(cwd, 'docs');
if (fs.existsSync(inputFilePath) && fs.existsSync(docsPath)) {
 console.log('Input file and directory exist in the current working directory');
} else {
 console.log('Input file or directory does not exist in the current working directory');
}
// Verifying file and directory existance in the filesystem root
const inputFilePathRoot = '/input.txt';
const docsPathRoot = '/docs';
if (fs.existsSync(inputFilePathRoot) && fs.existsSync(docsPathRoot)) {
 console.log('Input file and directory exist in the filesystem root');
} else {
 console.log('Input file or directory does not exist in the filesystem root');
}
``` 
Note that in JavaScript, you need to use `require` to import the `fs` module, which provides access to the filesystem. Also, in this code, we're using the `path` module to construct paths to files and directories. Finally, we're using the `process.cwd()` method to get the current working directory.
