The equivalent JavaScript code is as follows:

```javascript
let s = "12345678";
s = "0" + s; // by concatenation
console.log(s);
```

Please note that you cannot concatenate strings in Python directly with the `+` operator, but you can achieve the same result by using the concatenation function or by converting one of the strings to a number type (integer or float) and then performing arithmetic operations on them.
