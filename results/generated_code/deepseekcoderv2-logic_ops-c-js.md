 Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given C function:

```javascript
function printLogic(boolA, boolB) {
  console.log(`a and b is ${boolA && boolB}`);
  console.log(`a or b is ${boolA || boolB}`);
  console.log(`not a is ${!boolA}`);
}
```

This JavaScript function takes two boolean arguments, `boolA` and `boolB`, and outputs the results of "and" (`&&`), "or" (`||`), and "not" (`!`) operations on these arguments in the console.
