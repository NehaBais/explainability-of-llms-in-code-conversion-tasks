In Python, the code would look like this:

This Python program does not include error handling. It's assumed that two valid integers are inputted by users.

```python
a = int(input('Enter first number: '))
b = int(input('Enter second number: '))

print("a+b = ", a + b)
print("a-b = ", a - b)
print("a*b = ", a * b)
print("a/b = ", a // b) # rounds towards negative infinity
print("a%b = ", a % b)  # sign is the same as the dividend 
```
