Sure! Here's the Python code that converts the given Rust code snippet:
```python
a = "abc"
b = "Bac"

# Strings are coerced to str when borrowed and needed
if a == b:
    print("The strings are equal")
if a != b:
    print("The strings are not equal")
if a  > b:
    print("The first string is lexically after the second")
if a  < b:
    print("The first string is lexically before the second")
if a >= b:
    print("The first string is not lexically before the second")
if a <= b:
    print("The first string is not lexically after the second")

# case-insensitives:

# equality
# this avoids new allocations
if a.lower() == b.lower():
    print("Both strings are equal when ignoring case")

# everything else, create owned Strings, then compare as above
a2 = a.upper()
b2 = b.upper()
```
This Python code should produce the same output as the given Rust code. Note that the `to_ascii_uppercase()` and `to_ascii_lowercase()` methods are used to convert strings to their uppercase or lowercase equivalents, respectively.
