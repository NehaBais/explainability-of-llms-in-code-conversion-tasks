This problem can be solved by using the `std::fs` and `std::io` modules in Rust for filesystem operations. The error handling has been adjusted to Rust's standard error handling mechanism, where we return an ! (nil) if any error is encountered.

Firstly, let's create a function that creates a file or directory at the given path if it does not exist already. If this fails due to a conflicting state, it will return Err(e). This includes both cases of trying to make a directory where a file with the same name exists and vice versa.

```rust
use std::io::{self, Write};
use std::fs::{DirBuilder, File};
use std::path::Path;
use std::process;

const FILE_NAME: &'static str = "output.txt";
const DIR_NAME : &'static str = "docs";

fn create(root: Path) -> io::Result<()> {
    let f_path = root.join(&FILE_NAME);
    let d_path = root.join(&DIR_NAME);
    Ok(_ = DirBuilder::new().create_or_fs_opener(|p| Ok(File::open(p))).or_else(|e| {
        Err(([f_path, d_path].iter().find_last_unnamed()?, e))
    })
}
```

Next is the main function that calls `create` twice: once for the current directory and once for the root filesystem. We do not need to return an error here since if one fails, it will be reported in the calling function.

```rust
fn main() {
    if let Err(_) = create(Path::new(".")) || create(Path::new("/")) {}
}
```
This program creates a file called "output.txt" at each given path, and creates a directory with the name "docs" at each path if it does not already exist. If any of these operations fail due to conflicting states (i.e. one already exists), the error will be reported but the corresponding process will continue.
