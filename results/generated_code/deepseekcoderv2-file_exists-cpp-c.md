 To convert the given C++ code to C, we need to use the appropriate functions from the standard library that perform file system operations. The `std::filesystem` functionality is not available in standard C, so we will use POSIX-like functions for checking file existence and directory existence. Here's how you can achieve this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

void file_exists(const char *path) {
    struct stat path_stat;
    if (stat(path, &path_stat) == 0) {
        printf("%s", path);
        if (S_ISDIR(path_stat.st_mode)) {
            printf(" is a directory\n");
        } else {
            printf(" exists with a file size of %ld bytes.\n", path_stat.st_size);
        }
    } else {
        printf("%s does not exist\n", path);
    }
}

int main() {
    char path[256];

    // For the current working directory
    strcpy(path, "input.txt");
    file_exists(path);
    strcpy(path, "zero_length.txt");
    file_exists(path);
    strcpy(path, "docs/input.txt");
    file_exists(path);
    strcpy(path, "docs/zero_length.txt");
    file_exists(path);

    // For the filesystem root
    strcpy(path, "/input.txt");
    file_exists(path);
    strcpy(path, "/zero_length.txt");
    file_exists(path);
    strcpy(path, "/docs/input.txt");
    file_exists(path);
    strcpy(path, "/docs/zero_length.txt");
    file_exists(path);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **File Existence Check**: The `stat` function from the `<sys/stat.h>` library is used to check if a file or directory exists. It fills in the information contained in the structure pointed to by `path_stat`. If the call to `stat` fails (i.e., returns -1), it means the path does not exist.
2. **Directory Check**: The macro `S_ISDIR` is used to check if the file type is a directory. This is done using `if (S_ISDIR(path_stat.st_mode))`.
3. **Path Strings**: Since C does not have string manipulation as powerful as C++, we use fixed-size arrays (`char path[256]`) to hold path strings. In practice, you might want to handle paths more robustly depending on your needs and environment (e.g., using `malloc` for dynamic memory allocation).
4. **Path Construction**: For checking the root directory, absolute paths are used by prefixing them with `/`. This approach assumes that the program has appropriate permissions to access these locations.

This code will verify if files or directories exist in specified paths, similar to the original C++ version but implemented using pure C without relying on the `std::filesystem` library.
