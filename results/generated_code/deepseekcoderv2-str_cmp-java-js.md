 Sure, here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the provided Java code:

```javascript
function compare(A, B) {
    if (A === B) {
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are lexically equal.`);
    } else {
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not lexically equal.`);
    }

    if (A.toLowerCase() === B.toLowerCase()) {
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are case-insensitive lexically equal.`);
    } else {
        console.log(`'${A}' and '${B}' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.`);
    }

    if (A < B) {
        console.log(`'${A}' is lexically before '${B}'.`);
    } else if (A > B) {
        console.log(`'${A}' is lexically after '${B}'.`);
    }

    if (A <= B) {
        console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically after '${B}'.`);
    }
    if (A >= B) {
        console.log(`'${A}' is not lexically before '${B}'.`);
    }

    console.log(`The lexical relationship is: ${A < B ? -1 : A > B ? 1 : 0}`);
    console.log(`The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: ${A.toLowerCase() < B.toLowerCase() ? -1 : A.toLowerCase() > B.toLowerCase() ? 1 : 0}`);
}

// Test cases
compare("Hello", "Hello");
compare("5", "5.0");
compare("java", "Java");
compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ");
compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĵãvá");
```

### Explanation:
1. **Comparing two strings for exact equality**: This is done using the strict equality operator (`===`).
2. **Comparing two strings for inequality**: This is achieved by negating the result of the exact equality check.
3. **Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other**: This is checked using the lexicographical comparison `<` or `>` operators.
4. **Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after than the other**: This is achieved by negating the result of the lexicographical comparison.
5. **Case sensitive comparisons**: The original string comparisons are case-sensitive, but you can convert them to lowercase using `.toLowerCase()` for a case-insensitive comparison.
6. **Comparing numeric strings**: In JavaScript, numbers and their string representations can be compared directly, and the result will depend on the lexicographical order unless explicitly converted to numbers using `Number()`.

This JavaScript code demonstrates similar functionality to the provided Java code, including handling different types of comparisons such as case sensitivity and lexical ordering.
