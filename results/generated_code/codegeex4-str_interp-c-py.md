In Python, you can use the `format()` method or f-strings for string interpolation. Here is how it would look like using f-strings:

```python
extra = "little"
print(f"Mary had a {extra} lamb.")
```

And here's how to do it using the `format` method:

extra = "little"
print("Mary had a {} lamb.".format(extra))

Both of these snippets would produce the output: `Mary had a little lamb.`
