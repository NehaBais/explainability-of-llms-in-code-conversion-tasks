The equivalent code in Python is as follows:

```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    print("a & b:", a & b)
    print("a | b:", a | b)
    print("a ^ b:", a ^ b)

    # The bitwise NOT operator is available directly in Python
    print("~a:", ~a)

    # Note: Python's bitwise shift operators behave differently from C/C++.
    # For a right shift, the result of shifting by a negative number is undefined.
    # For right arithmetic shift (also known as "arithmetic right shift"), the bits are filled with zeros
    # if the leftmost bit is 1. For left shift and right rotate operations in Python,
    # these functions exist in the `operator` module.

    print("a << b:", a << b)
    print("a >> b:", a >> b)

    # Python has no built-in functions for rotating an integer, so you would have to
    # write your own or use a library that supports this functionality.
```

In this code, we use the `operator` module for right arithmetic shift, but there is no direct Python function for left and right rotate operations. 

Please note that in Python, the bit operators are used as they are in C++ (e.g., `&`, `|`, `^`). The Python equivalent of bitwise NOT (`~a`) would be `~a`. However, rotating an integer in Python requires a custom implementation since there is no built-in function for this.
