In Python, you can use the `os` module to verify if files and directories exist. Here is how your Java code would look translated into Python:

```python
import os

# For the current working directory
print(os.path.exists("docs/input.txt"))
print(os.path.exists("/docs/input.txt"))

# This will raise an error because you can't directly access filesystem root from within a python script.
# Instead, use an absolute path or define your own function to handle this.
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it checks if a file called "input.txt" and a directory called "docs" exist in both the current working directory and the filesystem root. However, note that you might need to provide the full absolute path for checking files and directories at the root level due to security restrictions.
