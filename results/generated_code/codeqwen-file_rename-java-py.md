The following Python code accomplishes the same task as your Java program:

```python
import os

def rename_file(old_name, new_name):
    try:
        os.rename(old_name, new_name)
        return True
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File not found.")
        return False

def test(type, old_name, new_name):
    print("The following " + type + " called " + old_name +
            (rename_file(old_name, new_name) and " was renamed as" or " could not be renamed into")
            + new_name + "."
        )

test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt")
test("file", "/input.txt", "/output.txt")
test("directory", "docs", "mydocs")
test("directory", "/docs/", "/mydocs/")
```

This script uses the `os.rename()` function to rename a file or directory. If the file doesn't exist, it prints an error message and returns False. The renaming is done twice for each file ("here" and at the root of the filesystem), once with relative paths (e.g., "input.txt") and once with absolute paths starting with the root directory ("/").
