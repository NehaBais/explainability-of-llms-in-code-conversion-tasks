Sure, here's how you can convert the JavaScript code into Python:

```python
# Define the initial string with a comma and space in front
s = ", World"

# Prepend the original string with another string literal
s = "Hello" + s

# Print the result
print(s)
```
When you run this Python code, it will output: `Hello, World`.
