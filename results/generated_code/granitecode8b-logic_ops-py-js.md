Here's the JavaScript code that accomplishes the same task as the Python code you provided:
```
function logic(a, b) {
 console.log('a and b:', a && b);
 console.log('a or b:', a || b);
 console.log('not a:', !a);
}
```
In JavaScript, logical AND is represented by the `&&` operator, logical OR is represented by the `||` operator, and logical NOT is represented by the `!` operator. The `console.log()` function is used to print output to the console.
