Here is the converted code in C:
```
#include 
int main() {
 // Verify file exists in current working directory
 struct _stat buf;
 if (_stat("input.txt", &buf) == 0) {
 printf("File 'input.txt' exists in current working directoryn");
 } else {
 printf("File 'input.txt' does not exist in current working directoryn");
 }
 // Verify file exists in root directory
 if (_stat("/input.txt", &buf) == 0) {
 printf("File 'input.txt' exists in root directoryn");
 } else {
 printf("File 'input.txt' does not exist in root directoryn");
 }
 // Verify folder exists in current working directory
 if (_stat("docs", &buf) == 0) {
 printf("Folder 'docs' exists in current working directoryn");
 } else {
 printf("Folder 'docs' does not exist in current working directoryn");
 }
 // Verify folder exists in root directory
 if (_stat("/docs", &buf) == 0) {
 printf("Folder 'docs' exists in root directoryn");
 } else {
 printf("Folder 'docs' does not exist in root directoryn");
 }
 return 0;
}
```
Note that the `struct _stat buf` line is used to declare a variable of type `_stat`, which is a structure that contains information about a file or directory. The `_stat()` function is used to retrieve information about a file or directory, and it takes two arguments: the name of the file or directory, and a pointer to a `_stat` structure that will be filled with information about the file or directory.
The `if (_stat("input.txt", &buf) == 0)` line checks if the file "input.txt" exists in the current working directory by calling the `_stat()` function. If the function returns 0, it means that the file exists and the message "File 'input.txt' exists in current working directory" is printed. Otherwise, the message "File 'input.txt' does not exist in current working directory" is printed.
The same process is repeated for verifying the existence of the file "input.txt" in the root directory (which is represented by "/"), and for verifying the existence of the folder "docs" in both the current working directory and the root directory.
