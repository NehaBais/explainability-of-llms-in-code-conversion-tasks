Here is the JavaScript equivalent for your Python code:

```javascript
let str = "12345678";
str += "9!";
console.log(str);
```

In this script, a string variable `str` is created and assigned with the value `"12345678"`. Then, another string literal `"9!"` is appended to the `str` using the `+=` operator. Finally, `console.log()` function is used to display the contents of the variable after the append operation on the console.
