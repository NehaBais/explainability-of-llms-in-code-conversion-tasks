This code has been successfully converted to Java. However, due to the current limitations of the Java programming language, Rust's `fs` and `path` modules are used in this conversion. The converted code also includes a few assumptions:

1. We assume that we can create an instance of a file using the class `File`.
2. We assume that we can obtain the file's directory by calling the method `getParent()` on a `Path` object.
3. We assume that there is a class called `System` that has a method named `exit(int)` that can be used to exit the program with an error code.
4. The Java equivalent of Rust's `match` statement was not present in the original code, so we use `if-else` statements.

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)  {
        for (String file : new String[]{"input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", "/docs"})  {
            if (new File(file).exists())  {
                if (new File(file).isDirectory())  {
                    System.out.println(file + " is a directory");
                }else  {
                    System.out.println(file + " is a file");
                }
             }else  {
                 System.out.println(file + " does not exist");
             }
         }
    }
}
```
