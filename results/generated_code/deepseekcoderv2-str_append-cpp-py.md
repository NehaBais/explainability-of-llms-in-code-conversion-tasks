 Here's the equivalent Python code for the given C++ code:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value.
greeting = "Hello"

# Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way.
greeting += " , world!"

# Show the contents of the variable after the append operation.
print(greeting)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the C++ code: it initializes a string variable `greeting` with the value "Hello", appends ", world!" to it, and then prints the resulting string.
