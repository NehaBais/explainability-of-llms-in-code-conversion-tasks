 Here's how you can convert the given Java code into Python:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
string = "def"

# Prepend the string variable with another string literal
string = "abc" + string

print(string)  # Output will be "abcdef"
```

This Python code does exactly what the Java code does: it initializes a string variable `string` with the value "def", then prepends "abc" to it, and finally prints the result.
