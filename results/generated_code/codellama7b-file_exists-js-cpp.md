To convert this code from JavaScript to C++, you can use the following template:
```
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    filesystem::path input_txt("input.txt");
    if (filesystem::exists(input_txt)) {
        cout << "File exists!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "File does not exist." << endl;
    }

    filesystem::path c_docs("c:/docs");
    if (filesystem::exists(c_docs)) {
        cout << "Folder exists!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Folder does not exist." << endl;
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* The `#include <filesystem>` directive includes the `<filesystem>` header file, which provides functions for working with the file system.
* The `using namespace std;` statement brings the standard library into scope, so you can use its functions without qualifying them with the `std::` prefix.
* The `filesystem::path` type is used to represent a path in the file system. You can create an instance of this type by calling its constructor with a string argument that represents the path.
* The `filesystem::exists()` function returns `true` if the specified path exists, and `false` otherwise. In this example, we use it to check whether the input.txt file and the docs folder exist in the current working directory and in the filesystem root.
* The `cout << "File exists!" << endl;` statement prints a message to the console if the input.txt file exists.
* Similarly, the `cout << "Folder exists!" << endl;` statement prints a message to the console if the docs folder exists.
* The `main()` function is the entry point of the program, and it runs when the executable is launched. It creates two instances of `filesystem::path`, one for the input.txt file and another for the docs folder, and then uses the `exists()` function to check whether they exist in the current working directory and in the filesystem root. If either of them does not exist, it prints a message to the console indicating that they do not exist.
