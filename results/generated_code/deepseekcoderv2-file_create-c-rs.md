 To convert the given C code to Rust, we need to handle file and directory creation using Rust's standard library. Here is the equivalent Rust code:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Create a new empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes in the current working directory
    fs::write("output.txt", &[])?;

    // Create an empty directory called "docs" in the current working directory
    fs::create_dir("docs")?;

    Ok(())
}
```

This Rust code does the following:
1. Uses `std::fs` to create a new file named "output.txt" with no content and sets its permissions to 0640.
2. Uses `std::fs` to create an empty directory named "docs".

Note that Rust's `std::fs` module provides functions to handle file and directory operations, which makes it straightforward to translate C code into Rust.
