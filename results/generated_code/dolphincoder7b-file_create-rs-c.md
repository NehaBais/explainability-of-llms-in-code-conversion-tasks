This is a simple Rust program that creates an empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes in the current working directory (".") and also an empty directory called "docs" in the filesystem root ("/"). It does this twice to ensure it's correct for both cases:

1. Create function
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    const char *file_name = "output.txt";
    const char *dir_name  = "docs";

    // Create file in current working directory
    FILE *f = fopen(file_name, "w");
    if (!f) {
        perror("Error creating output.txt");
        exit(1);
    }
    fclose(f);

    // Create directory at root
    const char *root = "/";
    const size_t dir_path_len = strlen(root) + 1 + strlen(dir_name);
    char full_dir_path[dir_path_len];
    snprintf(full_dir_path, sizeof(full_dir_path), "%s%s", root, dir_name);

    if (mkdir(full_dir_path, 0755) != 0) {
        perror("Error creating docs");
        exit(1);
    }
}
```

2. Error handling function

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void error_handler(const char *error, int code) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", error);
    exit(code);
}

The above C program works in a similar way to the Rust program. It creates an empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory called "docs". The file is created in the current working directory (".") and the directory is created at the root ("/"). Please note that creating the same directory multiple times can have different effects, so this program will fail if the directory already exists on the target system. Also, the `mkdir` function may not work correctly when executed with root privileges.
