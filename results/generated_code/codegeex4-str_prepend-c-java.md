```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "my String";
        String cstr = "Changed ";
        String newStr = cstr + str;
        System.out.println(newStr);
    }
}
```

This Java code accomplishes the same task as your C code. It creates a string variable `str` equal to any text value, prepends it with another string literal `cstr`, and then prints out the result. 

Please note that in Java there is no need for memory allocation/deallocation like in C as Java has its own garbage collection system.
