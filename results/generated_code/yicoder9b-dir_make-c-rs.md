In Rust you can use the `std::fs` module for file and directory operations. Here is a possible Rust implementation:

Please note that in Rust, to create a directory we have to use the `create_dir_all()` function of the `std::fs` module. 

```rust
use std::{error::Error, fs};

pub fn make_directory(path: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    fs::create_dir_all(path)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

In this function, `path` is the directory path that you want to create. If it doesn't exist, the function will try to create all the necessary parent directories along with your specified path. If any error occurs during the process (like permission errors), it will return an error which can be handled using the usual Rust Result pattern (`?` operator in this case).
If the directory already exists, the function will not do anything and return `Ok(())` successfully.
