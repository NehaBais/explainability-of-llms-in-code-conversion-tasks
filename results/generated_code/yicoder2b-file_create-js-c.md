This JavaScript code is written in Node.js to create two files and two directories: "output.txt" with no content and "docs" directory with no content, at the current working directory (here) and filesystem root. 

Here's how it could be converted into C code:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char filename[100] = "output.txt";
    FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "w");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file %s\n", filename);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    fclose(fp);

    char directory[100] = "/docs";
    DIR *d = opendir(directory);
    if (d == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening dir %s\n", directory);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    closedir(d);

    snprintf(filename, 100, "%s/output.txt", directory);
    fp = fopen(filename, "w");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file %s\n", filename);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    fclose(fp);

    snprintf(directory, 100, "%s/docs", "/");
    d = opendir(directory);
    if (d == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening dir %s\n", directory);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    closedir(d);

    return 0;
}
```

Please be aware that in C, you have to include system/functions required specifically for creating files and directories. In Node.js, the 'fs' module provides this functionality. Here we are just using printf functions to print error messages. The `snprintf` function is used to construct filenames with directory paths manually since it is not possible in C or other languages to append path elements directly to a file pointer.
