The Python code is almost identical to the C++ one, we just change some syntax and library calls:
```python
import os 

def main(): 
    with open('output.txt', 'w') as f: 
        pass   # Do nothing but write empty file.
        
    with open('/output.txt', 'w') as f: 
        pass   # Write an empty file at filesystem root level.
    
    os.makedirs('docs', exist_ok=True)
    try: 
        os.makedirs('/docs', exist_ok=True)
    except FileNotFoundError: 
        print("/docs could not be created as the parent directory does not exist.")

if __name__ == "__main__": 
    main()  
```
The above Python code will create an empty file named output.txt in the current working directory and at filesystem root level. It also creates an 'empty' directory called 'docs'. If you try to make a directory at the root level that doesnâ€™t exist, it would raise a FileNotFoundError since there is no such thing as a root in Python.
