Below is the equivalent C code to rename a file and directory as per the provided Golang code. Please note, in Unix-like systems including Linux or macOS, you have to be careful about permissions to rename files or directories.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void rename_files_and_dirs_in_current_dir() {
    if (rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0) {
        perror("Error renaming input.txt");
    }
    
    if (rename("docs", "mydocs") != 0) {
        perror("Error renaming docs directory");
    }
}

void rename_files_and_dirs_in_root_dir() {
    if (rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt") != 0) {
        perror("Error renaming /input.txt");
    }

    if (rename("/docs", "/mydocs") != 0) {
        perror("Error renaming /docs directory");
    }
}

int main() {
    rename_files_and_dirs_in_current_dir();
    rename_files_and_dirs_in_root_dir();

    return 0;
}
```

In this C code, the `perror()` function is used to print an error message that describes the last error that occurred during a call to a system function. This function should be included using `#include <stdio.h>` and `#include <stdlib.h>`. 

Also note that you need root permissions to rename files or directories located in `/` (root directory). The user should run this program with `sudo` in Unix-like systems.
