Here's the converted code from C to Python that meets your requirements:
```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
str = "Good Morning"
# Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way
str += " to all !!!"
# Show the contents of the variable after the append operation
print(str)
```
In Python, we can use the `+=` operator to concatenate two strings together. This is the most idiomatic way to append a string to another in Python. The `strcat()` function in C is equivalent to the `+=` operator in Python. The `sprintf()` function in C is equivalent to the `.join()` method in Python, which concatenates a list of strings together using a specified separator.
