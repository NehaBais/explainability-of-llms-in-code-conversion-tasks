The provided code is written in C++ and uses the filesystem library to achieve its tasks. The two lines of codes are creating an empty output file and directory, respectively. However, they are not creating them in the current working directory or the root of the filesystem. Therefore, we need to give a full path for both.

Here is how you can convert this C++ code to JavaScript:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Create an empty file
fs.openSync("output.txt", 'w') || {};

// Create an empty directory in the root of the filesystem
fs.mkdirSync('/docs', { recursive: true });

```
This JavaScript code uses the built-in Node.js fs library to accomplish its tasks. It is creating an output file and a docs directory in the root of the filesystem. The `mkdir` method does not support creating directories recursively (as you have requested), so we set it to true with `fs.mkdtempSync('/', { recursive: true })`. If the directory already exists, this will do nothing. This is because when Node runs in a browser context, there is no root filesystem and none of the methods like `fs.mkdirSync` or `fs.mkdtempSync` exist.
