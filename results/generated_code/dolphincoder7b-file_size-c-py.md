```python
import os

def main():
    try:
        stats = os.stat('input.txt')
        print(f'{stats.st_size}')
        stats = os.stat('/input.txt')
        print(f'{stats.st_size}')
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
The above Python code is equivalent to the given C code. The `os` module in Python provides functions for file system operations. Here, we use the `stat()` function to get information about a file or directory. We also handle potential exceptions that may occur during the process.
