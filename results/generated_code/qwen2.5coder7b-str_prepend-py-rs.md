Here is your code converted to Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("12345678");
    s.insert(0, '0');
    println!("{}", s);
}
```

This code does the same thing as your original Python script. It starts with a string `s` equal to "12345678", then prepends "0" to it, and finally prints out the result.
