Sure, I can help you convert the given Python code to JavaScript. JavaScript does not have a built-in `os` module like Python. However, we can use the Node.js `fs` module to create directories and handle the parent directories if they don't exist.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function mkdirp(path) {
  try {
    fs.promises.mkdir(path, { recursive: true }).catch((err) => {
      if (err.code !== 'EEXIST') {
        console.error(`Error creating directory ${path}:`, err);
      }
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

// Example usage:
mkdirp('./path/to/dir');
```

In this JavaScript code, we first import the `fs` and `path` modules. Then, we define a function called `mkdirp` that takes a single parameter `path`. Inside the function, we use `fs.promises.mkdir(path, { recursive: true })` to create the directory. The `{ recursive: true }` option ensures that all parent directories are created if they do not exist.

The `catch` block is used to handle any errors that may occur during the directory creation process. If the error code is not 'EEXIST', it means that there was an issue creating the directory, and we log an error message.

Finally, we provide an example usage of the `mkdirp` function by calling it with the path './path/to/dir'. This will create the directory and its parent directories if they do not exist.
