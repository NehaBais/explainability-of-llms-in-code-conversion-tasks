Sure, here is the equivalent code in Golang. 

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)
func main() {
	str := "12345678" // Create a string variable equal to any text value
	str += "9!"       // Append the string literal in the most idiomatic way
	fmt.Println(str)  // Show the contents of the variable after the append operation
}
```
Just as a note, Golang does not require specifying the type of variable when it is declared. It's an automatic feature.
