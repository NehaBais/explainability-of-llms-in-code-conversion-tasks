To convert this code from JavaScript to Java, you can use a similar approach as in the previous example. Here is the equivalent Java code for the above JavaScript code:
```
String s = ", World";
s = "Hello" + s;
System.out.println(s);
```
The main difference between the two codes is that in Java, you need to use `+` instead of `+=`, and also you don't need to use the `print()` function as it is not a built-in method in Java.
