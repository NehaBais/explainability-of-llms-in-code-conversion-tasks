Your code already has the correct syntax for renaming files and directories in both relative ("here") and absolute ("/root") paths. This is done with the `rename()` function from standard library in C/C++. However, you might want to use exception handling for error checks rather than just returning an integer status code.

Here's your updated version: 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

int main() {
    try {
        if(rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0)
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to rename input.txt into output.txt");
        
        if(rename("docs", "mydocs") != 0)
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to rename docs into mydocs");
            
       // Renaming in the filesystem root requires the "/" as absolute path
        char* pwd = get_current_dir_name(); 
        if(chdir("/") != 0) 
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to change directory to '/'");
        
        if(rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0)
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to rename /input.txt into /output.txt");
      
        if(chdir(pwd) != 0)  // change back to original directory
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to change directory back to the original path");
        
        if(rename("docs", "mydocs") != 0)
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to rename /docs into /mydocs");
    } catch (std::exception &e) {
      std::cerr << e.what() << '\n';
      return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;  
}
```
This code handles exceptions and provides clear error messages when things go wrong, while also handling the case where you might need to switch between the current directory and root ("/") during its execution. It stores the original working directory before changing into the filesystem root, so it can return back after renaming "/input.txt" and "/docs".
