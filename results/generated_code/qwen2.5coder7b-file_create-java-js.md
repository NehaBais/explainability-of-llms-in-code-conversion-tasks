The JavaScript version of the code you provided can be written as follows:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function createFilesAndDirectory() {
    try {
        // Create an empty file in the current directory
        fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'output.txt'), '');

        // Create an empty file in the root of the filesystem (works on Unix-like systems)
        fs.writeFileSync(path.join('/', 'output.txt'), '');

        // Create a directory named "docs" in the current directory
        if (!fs.existsSync(path.join(__dirname, 'docs'))) {
            fs.mkdirSync(path.join(__dirname, 'docs'));
        }

        // Create a directory named "docs" at the root of the filesystem (works on Unix-like systems)
        if (!fs.existsSync(path.join('/', 'docs'))) {
            fs.mkdirSync(path.join('/', 'docs'));
        }
    } catch(e) {
        console.error('Error creating file or directory:', e.message);
    }
}

createFilesAndDirectory();
```

The `path` module is used to handle and transform file paths in a way that is platform-independent. It provides utilities for working with files and directories. The `fs` module gives you access to the file system, which is necessary to create new files and directories.

Please note that creating a file or directory at the root of the filesystem may require elevated permissions, so this operation may not work in all environments. Additionally, depending on your operating system, you might encounter permission issues when trying to write to certain directories like `/`.

This code will run from within a Node.js environment. If you want to run it in an HTML file with JavaScript, you'll need a way to interact with the file system through server-side JavaScript (Node.js) or by using browser APIs like `fetch` and `Blob`, but these won't allow direct manipulation of files on your machine due to security restrictions.
