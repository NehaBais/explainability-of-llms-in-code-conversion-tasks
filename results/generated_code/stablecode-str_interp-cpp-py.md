The equivalent Python code for the given C++ code is as follows:

```python
original = "Mary had a X lamb."
toBeReplaced = "X"
replacement = "big"
newString = original.replace(original.find(toBeReplaced)), len(toBeReplaced), replacement)
print("String after replacement:", newString)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the C++ code provided: it replaces a specific character sequence in a string with another value or variable value. The result is then printed to the console.
