Sure, here's the C++ code that accomplishes this task:
```
#include 
int main()
{
 std::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
 std::rename("docs", "mydocs");
 #ifdef _WIN32
 std::rename(L"C:/input.txt", L"C:/output.txt");
 std::rename(L"C:/docs", L"C:/mydocs");
 #endif
 return 0;
}
```
The code uses the `std::rename` function from the `` library to rename files and directories in C++. The first two calls to `std::rename` are made in the current working directory, while the last two calls use the full path of each file and directory.
On Windows, the code includes a conditional statement that checks for the `_WIN32` macro. If it's defined, then the function is called twice with Unicode strings (using the `L` prefix) to rename files in the filesystem root as well.
