In Python, you can use the `+` operator to append strings and create a new string. Here is your code converted:

```python
# Define the initial string variable
greeting = "Hello"

# Append another string literal
greeting += ", world!"

# Print the updated greeting
print(greeting)
```

This will output:

Hello, world!
