Here is the equivalent Python code for the given Rust program: 

```python
def main():
  # only same types can be compared
  # string and string or str and str
  a = "abc"
  b = "Bac"

  # exact equality
  if a == b: print("The strings are equal.") 

  # inequality
  if a != b: print("The strings are not equal.") 

  # lexical order (before and after)
  if a > b : print("The first string is lexically after the second.") 
  if a < b : print("The first string is lexically before the second.") 

  # case-sensitive comparison
  a_lower = a.lower()
  b_lower = b.lower()
  if a_lower == b_lower: print("Both strings are equal when ignoring case.") 

  # numeric string comparison
  a1 = "34"
  b1 = "267"
  print(f'numeric comparison of {a1} and {b1}: {a1 > b1}') # it will be false as it is comparing the ASCII value of numbers.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code covers all the requested string comparisons: exact equality, inequality, lexical order before and after, case-sensitive comparison, and numeric string comparison.
