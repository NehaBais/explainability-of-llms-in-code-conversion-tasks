Answer: Here is the C code that converts the Rust code into C with some minor modifications to make it more C-like and less rust-y. The main modification is replacing the `println` function calls with their equivalent `printf` functions, and adding a trailing semicolon to each statement since they are required in C but not in Rust.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Mary had a %s lamb\n", "little");
    // You can specify order
    printf("%s had a %s lamb\n", "little", "Mary");
    // Or named arguments if you prefer
    printf("%s had a %s lamb\n", "Mary", "little");
    return 0;
}
```
