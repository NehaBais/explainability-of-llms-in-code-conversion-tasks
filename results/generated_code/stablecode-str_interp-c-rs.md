Here is the equivalent Rust code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let extra = "little";
    println!("Mary had a {} lamb.", extra);
}
```

This Rust program does exactly the same thing as your given C program. 

- We define a variable `extra` and assign it the value `"little"`. 
- In the print statement, we use string formatting to substitute in the value of `extra`. The format specifier `{}` is used to denote where the value should be inserted.
- When this program runs, it will output: 

Mary had a little lamb.
