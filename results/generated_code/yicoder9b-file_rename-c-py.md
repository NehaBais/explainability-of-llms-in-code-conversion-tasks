In Python the `os` module provides functions for handling file and directory names. Here is how you can convert that C code to Python:

```python
import os

# Rename in current working directory
try: 
    os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print('File not found in the current directory')

try:
    os.rename("docs", "mydocs")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print('Directory not found in the current directory')

# Rename at filesystem root
try: 
    os.rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print('File not found at the filesystem root')

try:
    os.rename("/docs", "/mydocs")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print('Directory not found at the filesystem root')
```
Please keep in mind that Python's `os.rename()` function will raise a FileNotFoundError if either the source or destination file does not exist. 
It is also important to note that Python's `os` module does not provide a way to rename directories and files at the filesystem root unless you are running as an administrator. The error handling in this script assumes those cases, but it may be necessary to handle these situations differently depending on your specific use case or environment.
