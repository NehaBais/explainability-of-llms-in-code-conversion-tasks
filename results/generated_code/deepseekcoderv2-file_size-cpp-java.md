### Answer 1
The following code is the conversion of the given C++ program to Java:
```
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        File file = new File("input.txt");
        if (file.exists()) {
            System.out.println("Size of input.txt is " + Files.size(file.toPath()));
        } else {
            System.err.println("File not found: input.txt");
        }

        File root = new File("/");
        if (root.exists()) {
            System.out.println("Size of / is " + Files.size(root.toPath()));
        } else {
            System.err.println("Directory not found: /");
        }
    }
}
```
### Answer 2
The program uses the `File` and `Files` classes from Java's standard library to perform file operations, ensuring that the code is compatible with Java syntax. The main function first checks if a local file named "input.txt" exists in the current directory using the `exists()` method of the `File` class. If it does exist, it then prints its size by converting the path from the File object to a Path object and passing it to the `size()` method of the Files class.

If the file doesn't exist locally, an error message is printed to standard error stream (System.err).

Similarly, the program checks if the root directory "/" exists in the file system using the same process as before. If it does exist, its size is printed in a similar way. Otherwise, an error message is printed for this case too.
