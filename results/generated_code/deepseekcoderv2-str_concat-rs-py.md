 Here's the equivalent Python code for the given Rust code:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value.
s = "hello"
print(s)

# Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal.
s1 = s + " world"
print(s1)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Rust code: it creates a string variable `s` and prints its content, then concatenates " world" to it and stores the result in `s1`, which is then printed.
