The equivalent code in JavaScript would be:

```javascript
let str = "my String";
let cstr = "Changed ";
let newStr = `${cstr}${str}`;
console.log(newStr);
```

In this JavaScript version, the string is first assigned to a variable named 'str'. Then another string is assigned to the variable named 'cstr'. After that, a template literal is used to concatenate these two strings and assign it to a new variable named 'newStr'. The result is then logged to the console.
