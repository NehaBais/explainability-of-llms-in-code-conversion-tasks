 Here's the equivalent Go code to verify that a file called `input.txt` and a directory called `docs` exist, with checks for both the current working directory and the filesystem root:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func fileExists(path string) {
	fmt.Printf("%s: ", path)
	if _, err := os.Stat(path); os.IsNotExist(err) {
		fmt.Println("does not exist")
	} else if info, _ := os.Stat(path); info.IsDir() {
		fmt.Println("is a directory")
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("exists with a file size of %d bytes.\n", info.Size())
	}
}

func main() {
	fileExists("input.txt")
	fileExists("zero_length.txt")
	fileExists("docs/input.txt")
	fileExists("docs/zero_length.txt")
}
```

This Go code performs the same checks as your C++ code:
1. It uses `os.Stat` to check if a file or directory exists.
2. If it doesn't exist, it prints "does not exist".
3. If it does exist and is a directory, it prints "is a directory".
4. If it does exist and is a file, it prints the file size in bytes.
5. The checks are performed for both `input.txt` and `zero_length.txt`, as well as within a subdirectory (`docs`) of the current working directory.
