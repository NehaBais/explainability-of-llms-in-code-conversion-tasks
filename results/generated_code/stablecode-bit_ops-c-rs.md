Here is the equivalent Rust code for performing bitwise AND, OR, XOR operations on two integers and also for performing a bitwise NOT operation on the first integer along with other specified operations:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 10; // First integer
    let b = 5;  // Second integer

    println!("a and b: {}", a & b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a | b);
    println!("a xor b: {}", a ^ b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);

    let shift_amount = 2; // Shift amount
    println!("a << n: {}", a << shift_amount);  // Left shift 

    println!(
        "a >> n: {}",   /* Rust performs on most platforms: arithmetic right shift */
        a as usize >> shift_amount
    );

    let rotate_amount = 3; // Rotate amount 
    println!("(a << shift_amount) >> rotate_amount: {}", (a << shift_amount) >> rotate_amount);  // Right rotate 

     /* Rust does not have a direct equivalent for left rotate and right rotate operations in C.
        However, you can achieve the same effect by using bitwise operations to manually implement the rotation operation */

    return;
}
```
This Rust code performs all the specified requirements for performing bitwise AND, OR, XOR operations on two integers and also performing a bitwise NOT operation on the first integer along with other specified operations.
