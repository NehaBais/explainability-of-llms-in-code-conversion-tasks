 Certainly! Below is the equivalent Python code for the provided C++ code. This Python script creates a string variable with the value "prepended to my string" and then prepends another string literal to it.

```python
def main():
    # Create a list of strings that will be concatenated
    my_strings = ["prepended to", "my string"]
    
    # Concatenate the elements of the list into a single string
    prepended = ''.join(my_strings)
    
    # Print the result
    print(prepended)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this Python code:
- We use the `join` method to concatenate the elements of the list `my_strings`.
- The `''.join(my_strings)` effectively prepends the string "prepended to" to "my string".
