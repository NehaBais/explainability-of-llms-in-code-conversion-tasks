 Sure, here's how you can convert the given Rust code to JavaScript:

```javascript
// Create a string variable equal to any text value
let s = "World";

// Prepend the string variable with another string literal
s = "Hello " + s;

// Print the result
console.log(s);
```

This JavaScript code does the same thing as the Rust code: it initializes a string variable `s` with the value "World", prepends "Hello " to it, and then prints the resulting string.
