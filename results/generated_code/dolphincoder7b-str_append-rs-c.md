To convert the Rust code to C, we first need to create a working version of the Rust code that can compile and run. Unfortunately, there isn't an equivalent direct translation for Rust to C in this case. The Rust language is designed with safety in mind, whereas C lacks any type checking or runtime error handling mechanisms. Therefore, it's not possible to directly translate the Rust code into a functionally equivalent C program without sacrificing parts of the original functionality.

Here's a basic version of the Rust code that would compile and run:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void){
    char hello[] = "Hello world";
    strcat(hello, "!!!!");
    printf("%s\n", hello);
    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic program to concatenate two strings in C and print the result. You'll need to include string handling functions like `strcat` and `printf`. 

However, note that this code might not have the exact same functionality as the Rust code. The difference is due to differences between the memory management strategy of the languages. In Rust, memory allocation and deallocation are handled automatically by a garbage collector. In C, you need to manually allocate and deallocate memory using `malloc` and `free`. Additionally, in Rust, strings are immutable. In C, strings are mutable. You might need to copy or concatenate the strings if you want to modify them.

Please note that this is just a basic example of how to convert your Rust code to C. It's recommended to read up on pointers and memory management in both languages to ensure your program behaves as expected.

import subprocess
import sys

def execute_code(code):
    process = subprocess.Popen(['gcc', '-o', 'output', '-x', 'c', '-'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    output = process.communicate(input=code)[0]

    if output:
        print("Compilation Error:")
        for line in output.decode().split('\n'):
            print(line)

        return None
    else:
        return "output"

rust_code = '''
use std::ops::Add;

fn main(){
    let hello  = String::from("Hello world");
    println!("{}", hello.add("!!!!"));
}
'''

# Run and get output
result = execute_code(rust_code)
if result:
    print('Output:')
    # Call the compiled program
    subprocess.run(['./output'], stdout=sys.stdout, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
