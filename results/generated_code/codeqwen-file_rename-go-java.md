In Java, you can use the `java.nio.file.Files` class to rename files and directories. Here is your code translated into Java:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Files.move(Paths.get("input.txt"), Paths.get("output.txt"));
            Files.move(Paths.get("docs"), Paths.get("mydocs"));
            Files.move(Paths.get("/input.txt"), Paths.get("/output.txt"));
            Files.move(Paths.get("/docs"), Paths.get("/mydocs"));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

The `Files.move()` function in Java replaces the move() method from Golang, as well as renaming files and directories. The first parameter is the source path of the file or directory you wish to rename, and the second one is the destination path where you want to place it. If a file with the same name already exists at the destination location, an `IOException` will be thrown unless you specify that you want to replace existing files by using the `StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING` option as shown in the code snippet.

Remember to handle any potential exceptions that may occur during execution of this code (like permission issues or IO errors).
