Here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given C code snippet that performs string interpolation using the `printf` function in C:
```javascript
const extra = "big";
console.log(`Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`);
```
In this JavaScript code, we declare a constant variable `extra` and assign it the value `"big"`. Then, we use template literals to perform string interpolation using the `${}` syntax. The interpolated string is then printed to the console using the `console.log` function. This will output the following:

Mary had a big lamb.
