The equivalent code in C++ is as follows:
```cpp
std::string string = "def";
string = "abc" + string;
```
In this translation, we are using `std::string` instead of `String` because C++ uses `std::string`, not `String`. Also, the concatenation operator in C++ is `+`, which concatenates strings. The assignment operator `=` is used to set the value of a variable or object.
