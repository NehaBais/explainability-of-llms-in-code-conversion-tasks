Here's the JavaScript code that performs the same operations as the given Java code:
```
let string = 'abc';
console.log(string);
string += 'def';
console.log(string);
```
In this JavaScript code, we declare a variable `string` and assign it a value of `'abc'`. We then use the `console.log()` function to print the contents of the `string` variable, which will output `'abc'` to the console.
Next, we append the string literal `'def'` to the end of the `string` variable using the `+=` operator. This is equivalent to concatenating the two strings together using the `+` operator and assigning the result back to the `string` variable.
Finally, we use another `console.log()` function call to print the contents of the `string` variable, which will output `'abcdef'` to the console.
