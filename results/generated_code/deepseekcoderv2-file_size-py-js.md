 Certainly! Here is the equivalent JavaScript code to verify the size of a file called `input.txt` for both the current working directory and the root file system:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// For the current working directory
let sizeCurrent = fs.statSync(path.join(__dirname, 'input.txt')).size;
console.log(`Size of input.txt in current directory: ${sizeCurrent} bytes`);

// For the root file system
let sizeRoot = fs.statSync(path.join('/', 'input.txt')).size;
console.log(`Size of input.txt in root directory: ${sizeRoot} bytes`);
```

This code uses Node.js to read the size of the `input.txt` file from both the current working directory and the root file system. The `fs.statSync` function is used to get the file statistics, and then its size is accessed through the `.size` property.
