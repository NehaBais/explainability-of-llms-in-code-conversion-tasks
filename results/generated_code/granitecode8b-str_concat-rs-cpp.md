Here's the converted code from Rust to C++:
```
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
 string s = "hello";
 cout << s << endl;
 
 string s1 = s + " world";
 cout << s1 << endl;
 return 0;
}
```
In this code, we first create a string variable `s` and assign it the value of the string literal `"hello"`. We then print the contents of `s` to the console.
Next, we create another string variable `s1` and concatenate it with the original `s` variable and the string literal `" world"`. We then print the contents of `s1` to the console.
Note that in C++, we need to include the `` header file to use the `string` class, and we also need to include the `` header file to use the `cout` and `endl` objects for printing to the console.
