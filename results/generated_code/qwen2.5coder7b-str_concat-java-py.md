Here is your code converted from Java to Python:

```python
s = "hello"
print(s + " literal")
s2 = s + " literal"
print(s2)
```

This script creates two string variables, `s` and `s2`. `s` is set as "hello", and the second print statement concatenates `s` with the string literal " literal". This new value is then assigned to `s2`, and it is printed out.
