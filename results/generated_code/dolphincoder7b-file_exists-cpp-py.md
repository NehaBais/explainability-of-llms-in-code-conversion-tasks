Below is the equivalent Python code for the given C++ code. Note, it's not possible to check if a file exists or not on a system that doesn't have the file system module installed, as required by the original code.
```python
import os.path

def file_exists(path):
    print(path)
    if os.path.isfile(path):
        size = os.path.getsize(path)
        print(" exists with a file size of ", size, " bytes.")
    elif os.path.isdir(path):
        print(" is a directory")
    else:
        print(" does not exist")

file_exists('input.txt')
# file_exists('zero_length.txt') # This line will fail as we don't have the zero_length.txt file.
file_exists('docs/input.txt')
# file_exists('docs/zero_length.txt') # Similarly, this line will also fail since we don't have that file.
```
