Here is how you can convert the given JavaScript code to Rust:

Rust Code:
```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    // Get current working directory
    let current_dir = std::env::current_dir().unwrap();

    // Rename files and folders
    rename_file(&current_dir, "input.txt", "output.txt"));
    rename_folder(
        &current_dir,
        "docs",
        "mydocs",
    ));
    rename_file(&std::env::home_dir().unwrap(), "input.txt", "c:/output.txt"));
    rename_folder(
        &std::env::home_dir().unwrap(),
        "docs",
        "mydocs",
    ));
}

fn rename_file(args: &[String]) {
    let source = args[0].clone();
    let dest = args[1].clone();

    if let Ok(_) = fs::rename(&source, &dest)) {
        println!("Renamed file from {} to {}", &source, &dest);
    } else {
        eprintln!("Failed to rename file");
    }
}

fn rename_folder(args: &[String]) {
    let source = args[0].clone();
    let dest = format!("{}/{}", &args[1], &args[2]));

    if let Ok(_) = fs::rename(&source, &dest)) {
        println!("Renamed folder from {} to {}", &source, &dest);
    } else {
        eprintln!("Failed to rename folder");
    }
}
```
This Rust code uses the standard library's `fs` module to handle file operations and the standard library's `env` module to get the current working directory.
The `rename_file` function takes a list of strings as arguments, where the first string is the source file path, and the second string is the destination file path. This function uses the `fs::rename` method to rename the file from the source path to the destination path. If the renaming operation is successful, it prints a success message with the source and destination paths. If the renaming operation fails, it prints an error message indicating that the renaming operation failed.
The `rename_folder` function takes a list of strings as arguments, where the first string is the source folder path, and the second and third strings are the sub-directory names to be renamed. This function uses the `fs::rename` method to rename the sub-directory from the source path to the destination path. If the renaming operation is successful, it prints a success message with the source and destination paths. If the renaming operation fails, it prints an error message indicating that the renaming operation failed.
These functions handle the renaming of files and directories in both the current working directory and the root directory of the filesystem.
