Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your C++ code:

```javascript
let greeting = "Hello";
greeting += ", world!";
console.log(greeting);
```

This JavaScript code does exactly what your C++ code does:

1. It creates a string variable called `greeting` and assigns it the value "Hello".

2. It appends (adds) the string literal ", world!"" to the `greeting` variable.

3. It prints the contents of the `greeting` variable after the append operation. The equivalent of `std::cout << greeting << std::endl;` in JavaScript is `console.log(greeting);`.
