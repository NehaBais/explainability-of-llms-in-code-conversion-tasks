Here's the equivalent C++ code:
```
#include 
int main() {
 std::string s = "Hello, ";
 s += "World";
 std::cout << s;
 return 0;
}
```
In this C++ code, we first declare a string variable `s` and assign it the value of "Hello," using string literals. Then, we use the `+=` operator to prepend the string variable with another string literal, which is "World". Finally, we print out the resulting string using `std::cout`.
