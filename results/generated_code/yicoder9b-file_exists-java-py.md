In Python, you can use the `os` module to interact with directories and files. Here's how this Java code would look like in Python:

```python
import os

# Check for file and directory in current working directory
print(os.path.isfile('docs/input.txt'))
print(os.path.isdir('docs'))

# Check for file and directory at the root of the filesystem (works differently on Windows and Unix-like systems)
if os.name == 'posix':  # Unix or Linux
    print(os.path.isfile('/docs/input.txt'))
    print(os.path.isdir('/docs'))
elif os.name == 'nt':   # Windows
    print(os.path.isfile('C:\\docs\\input.txt'))
    print(os.path.isdir('C:\\docs'))
``` 

In Python's `os` module, the function `os.path.isfile()` checks whether a file exists and is not a directory. The function `os.path.isdir()` confirms if something is a directory or not. This code will print 'True' if it exists, otherwise 'False'.
  
Note that Python treats '/' (forward slash) as the path separator universally regardless of the operating system, which is why you see '/docs/input.txt' in the Python version despite this being a Windows-specific path syntax. However, if you want to explicitly handle Windows paths differently, you can use `os.name` attribute - it will be 'nt' for Windows and 'posix' for Unix or Linux systems.
