To convert this code from JavaScript to Python, you can use the `os` module in Python to create a directory and its parents if necessary. Here's an example of how you could implement the `mkdirp` function in Python:
```python
import os

def mkdirp(path):
    try:
        os.makedirs(path)
    except FileExistsError:
        pass
    except OSError as e:
        if e.errno != errno.ENOENT:
            raise
```
This code uses the `os.makedirs` function to create a directory and its parents, but it also catches any errors that may occur during this process. If an error occurs, it checks whether the error is related to the fact that the directory already exists (in which case the function will return successfully) or if it's related to a different issue. If it's not related to the directory existing, the error is raised again so that the calling code can handle it appropriately.

You can also use the `os` module to check whether a directory exists before creating it:

import os

def mkdirp(path):
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        os.makedirs(path)

This code uses the `os.path.exists` function to check whether the directory already exists, and if it doesn't exist, it creates the directory using `os.makedirs`. This can be useful if you want to avoid creating duplicate directories or if you want to handle errors in a specific way.

You can also use the `shutil` module in Python to create a directory and its parents:

import shutil

def mkdirp(path):
    try:
        shutil.make_dirs(path)
    except FileExistsError:
        pass
    except OSError as e:
        if e.errno != errno.ENOENT:
            raise

This code uses the `shutil.make_dirs` function to create a directory and its parents, but it also catches any errors that may occur during this process. If an error occurs, it checks whether the error is related to the fact that the directory already exists (in which case the function will return successfully) or if it's related to a different issue. If it's not related to the directory existing, the error is raised again so that the calling code can handle it appropriately.

You can also use the `os` module to check whether a directory exists before creating it:

import os

def mkdirp(path):
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        shutil.make_dirs(path)

This code uses the `shutil.make_dirs` function to create a directory and its parents, but it also checks whether the directory already exists before creating it using the `os.path.exists` function. This can be useful if you want to avoid creating duplicate directories or if you want to handle errors in a specific way.
