 In Java, you can use the `&&` and `||` logical operators for "and" and "or", respectively. The bitwise operator `~` can be used to perform "not". Here is how you would write this function in Java:

```java
public void logic(boolean a, boolean b) {
  System.out.println("a AND b: " + (a && b));
  System.out.println("a OR b: " + (a || b));
  System.out.println("NOT a: " + !a);
}
```
