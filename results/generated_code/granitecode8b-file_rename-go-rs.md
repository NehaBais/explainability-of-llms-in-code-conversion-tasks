Here's the Rust code that achieves the same requirement as the Golang code:
```
use std::fs;
use std::io;
fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
 fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt")?;
 fs::rename("docs", "mydocs")?;
 fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt")?;
 fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs")?;
 Ok(())
}
```
This code uses the `fs` module from the Rust standard library to perform file and directory renaming operations. The `rename` function takes two arguments: the current name of the file or directory and the new name that you want to give it. In this case, we are renaming "input.txt" to "output.txt", "docs" to "mydocs", "/input.txt" to "/output.txt", and "/docs" to "/mydocs". 
The `?` operator is used to handle any errors that may occur during the file or directory rename operation. If an error occurs, it will be returned as an `io::Result` type. The `Ok(())` at the end of the function indicates that the function has successfully executed without any errors.
