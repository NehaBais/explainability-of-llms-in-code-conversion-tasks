To convert this code from Go to C++, you can use the `std::filesystem` library in C++17 or later versions. The `std::filesystem` library provides a set of functions for working with file systems, including creating directories and checking their existence.

Here is an example of how you can convert the code from Go to C++ using `std::filesystem`:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <filesystem>

int main() {
    std::string path = "/tmp/some/path/to/dir";
    // Create a directory and any missing parents.
    std::filesystem::create_directories(path);

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `std::filesystem::create_directories()` function is used to create a directory and any missing parents at the specified path. The second argument specifies the permissions for the created directories. In this case, we use 0770 to set the permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner and group, but not for others.

Note that the `std::filesystem` library is only available in C++17 or later versions. If you are using an earlier version of C++, you may need to use a different approach to create directories and check their existence.
