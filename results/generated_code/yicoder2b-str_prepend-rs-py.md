Sure, here is how you can convert the above code into Python:

```python
s = "World"
s = "Hello " + s
print(s)
```
In this Python code, we are using the `+` operator for string concatenation. Note that we have to wrap our text with quotes (either single or double) when creating a string in python, as it is different from Rust.
