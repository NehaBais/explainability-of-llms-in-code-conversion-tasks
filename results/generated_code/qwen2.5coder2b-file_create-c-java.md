In Java, the equivalent code would be:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try { // create a new empty file "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory "docs"
            File f1 = new File("output.txt");
            if (!f1.createNewFile()) { // return false if the file already exists
                System.out.println("Cannot create output.txt");
            }

            File f2 = new File("docs");
            f2.mkdir(); // create a new empty directory "docs"

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This code first creates a new empty file named "output.txt" in the current working directory. It then checks if the file already exists using the `createNewFile()` method and prints an error message if it does.

Next, the code creates a new directory called "docs". It uses the `mkdir()` method which is part of Java's File class to create a new directory. The permission 0750 for rwxr-x--- is equivalent to setting the owner as root (i.e., all permissions set to 7), and the group as users (i.e., all permissions set to 5).
