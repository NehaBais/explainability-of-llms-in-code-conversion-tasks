```python
import os

# Get file size of the current input.txt file
size = os.path.getsize('./input.txt')

# Get file size of a file located in the root directory
root_size = os.path.getsize('/root/input.txt')
```
In Python, there is no need to use `new ActiveXObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")` as JavaScript because the built-in module `os` handles this for us. We can directly retrieve the file size by using `os.path.getsize()`. For the second part of your requirement, you should replace `'c:/input.txt'` with `'/root/input.txt'`. This will work on both Windows and Unix systems as long as the current directory is the root directory.
