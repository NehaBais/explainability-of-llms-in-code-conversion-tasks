In Java, you can use the `java.nio.file` package to create a directory and any missing parents. Here is an example of how you could implement this function:
```
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class Mkdir {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        if (args.length != 2) {
            System.out.println("usage: mkdir <path>");
            return;
        }

        Path pathToCreate = Paths.get(args[1]);

        if (Files.exists(pathToCreate)) {
            return;
        } else {
            Files.createDirectories(pathToCreate);
            System.out.println("Created directory: " + pathToCreate.toString());
            return;
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Paths` class to create a `Path` object from the command line argument, and then checks if the directory already exists using the `exists()` method of the `Files` class. If it does not exist, it creates the directory using the `createDirectories()` method, and prints a message indicating that the directory was created.

Note that this code assumes that the path passed as an argument is valid and exists on the file system. You may want to add error handling to handle cases where the path is invalid or does not exist.
