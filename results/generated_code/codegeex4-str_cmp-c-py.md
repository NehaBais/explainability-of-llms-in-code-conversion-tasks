The equivalent Python code for the given C program would be:

```python
import difflib

def compare(str1, str2):
    print("{0:7} {1:2d} {2:2d} {3:2d} {4:2d} {5:2d} {6:2d} {7}".format(
        str1, (str1 == str2), (str1 != str2), (str1 > str2),
        (str1 < str2), (str1 >= str2), (str1 <= str2), str2))

def comparecase(str1, str2):
    print("{0:7} {1:2d} {2:2d} {3:2d} {4:2d} {5:2d} {6:2d} {7} ignoring case".format(
        str1, (str1.lower() == str2.lower()), 
        (str1.lower() != str2.lower()),
        (str1.lower() > str2.lower()), (str1.lower() < str2.lower()),
        (str1.lower() >= str2.lower()), (str1.lower() <= str2.lower()), str2))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("eq , ne , gt , lt , ge , le")
    strings = ["ball", "bell", "ball", "ball", "YUP", "YEP",
               "ball", "BELL", "ball", "BALL", 
               "YUP", "yep", 
               "ball", "BELL", "ball", "BALL", 
               "YUP", "yep"]
    for i in range(0, len(strings), 2):
        compare(strings[i], strings[i+1])
        comparecase(strings[i], strings[i+1])
```

This Python code does the same as the original C program. It compares two strings and prints if they are equal or not, greater than, less than etc. It also supports both case sensitive and case insensitive comparisons. However, note that in python, numeric strings are compared as numbers (if possible), unlike C where they are treated as strings.

This code does not use difflib library because it's mainly used for comparing sequences of lines rather than individual strings. Comparing two individual strings requires a different approach.
