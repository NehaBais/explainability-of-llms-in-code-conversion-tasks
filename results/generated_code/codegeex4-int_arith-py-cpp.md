The quotient and remainder operators in C++ (the `/` operator and the `%` operator respectively) both follow the Euclidean division algorithm. They round towards zero.

The `pow()` function is used for exponentiation in C++. It takes two arguments: the base, then the power. The result is of type `double`.

Remember to link with math library by adding `-lm` when compiling (`g++ file.cpp -o output -lm`) if using gcc or g++ compiler.

The sign of the remainder `%` operator is determined by the dividend (the first operand), unless both operands are positive or zero, in which case itâ€™s the same as that of the divisor.
