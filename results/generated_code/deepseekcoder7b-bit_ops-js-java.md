The Java version of the JavaScript code you provided can be translated into this (assuming that `b` is within a valid range for all bitwise operations):

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 15; // Example integer 1
        int b = 2;  // Example integer 2
        
        System.out.println("a AND b: " + (a & b));
        System.out<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>.println("a OR b: "+ (a | b));
        System.out.println("a XOR b: "+ (a ^ b));
        System.out.println("NOT a: " + ~a);
        
        // Perform shifts and rotates on first integer with amount of second integer.
        if(b >= 0 && b < 32) {   // To avoid IllegalArgumentException in java for bit manipulations 
            System.out.println("Left Shift a by b: " + (a << b));   
            System.out.println("Right Shift a by b: "+ (a >> b));     
        } else {
            System.out.println("Shift amount should be between 0 and 31");
        }
        
    }
}
```
Bitwise operations in Java are different from JavaScript, hence the differences in syntax and behavior. Specifically:
- The `~` operator performs a bitwise NOT operation on an integer which flips all of its bits. In JavaScript, this is generally used to convert integers into their 32bit binary representation but it does not provide same results when used directly as Java's ~ operator also negates the number and then perform one's complement operation.
- The bitwise shift operations `<<` (left) and `>>` (right) in JavaScript will sign extend, i.e., they retain the sign of the number, while Java simply trims to 0. You may want a similar effect by masking with an appropriate value but it's often not needed or desired for integer types.
- The bitwise shift operation `>>>` (right) in JavaScript performs zero fill left shift which is same as logical right shift in java.  

Remember:
Java and JavaScript handle negative numbers differently, so if you need to perform a bitwise operation on integers that can be negative consider using Java's built-in functions or additional libraries.
