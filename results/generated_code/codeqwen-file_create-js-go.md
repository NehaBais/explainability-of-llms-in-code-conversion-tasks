The equivalent Go code for the JavaScript code you provided is as follows:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Create an empty file "output.txt" in the current working directory
	file, err := os.Create("./output.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// Create an empty directory "docs" in the current working directory
	err = os.Mkdir("./docs", 0755)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	// Create an empty file "output.txt" in the root directory
	file, err = os.Create("/output.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// Create an empty directory "docs" in the root directory
	err = os.Mkdir("/docs", 0755)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
}
```
This Go code creates an empty file called "output.txt" in both the current working directory and the root directory, as well as an empty directory called "docs" in both directories. The `os.Create()` function is used to create a new file and return a pointer to it, while the `os.Mkdir()` function is used to create a new directory. The second argument to these functions is a mode value that determines the permissions of the new file or directory. In this case, we use `0755` which represents read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others.
