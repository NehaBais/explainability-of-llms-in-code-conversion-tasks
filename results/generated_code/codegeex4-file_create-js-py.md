In Python, you can use the built-in `open` and `os` modules to achieve this. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import os

def create_file(path):
    try:
        with open(path, 'w'):
            pass  # This creates an empty file of size 0 bytes.
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

def create_directory(path):
    try:
        os.mkdir(path)  # This creates an empty directory.
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

# Here
create_file("output.txt")
create_directory("docs")

# And in the filesystem root
create_file("/output.txt")
create_directory("/docs")
```

This code will first attempt to create a file and directory at the given path. If an error occurs, it will be printed to the console. Note that writing files or creating directories in the filesystem root typically requires elevated permissions (often via sudo or Administrator mode on Windows), so this code may need to be run with those permissions to function correctly.
