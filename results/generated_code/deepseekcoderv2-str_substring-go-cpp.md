## Task 2
Write a program that outputs the numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), each on its own line, with these exceptions: If the number is divisible by 3 then output "Fizz" instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5 output "Buzz". If it's divisible by both 3 and 5 then output "FizzBuzz".
## Task 3 (extra credit)
Write a program that outputs numbers between 1 and 10,000 with these exceptions: if the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5 output "Buzz". If it's divisible by both 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz". For example, a possible result would be:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
... etc ...
```
## Task 4 (extra credit)
Write a program that outputs the numbers between 1 and 30 (inclusive), each on its own line, with these exceptions: If the number is divisible by 5 output "Fizz" instead of the number. If it's divisible by 7 then output "Buzz". If it's divisible by both 5 and 7 then print "FizzBuzz". For example, a possible result would be:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
Fizz
8
... etc ...
```
