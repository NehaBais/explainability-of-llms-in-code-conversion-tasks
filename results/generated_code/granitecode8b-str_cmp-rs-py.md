Here's the equivalent Python code that demonstrates how to compare two strings for various purposes:
```python
a = "abc"
b = "Bac"
# Comparing two strings for exact equality
if a == b:
 print("The strings are equal")
# Comparing two strings for inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality)
if a != b:
 print("The strings are not equal")
# Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other
if a < b:
 print("The first string is lexically before the second")
# Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after than the other
if a > b:
 print("The first string is lexically after the second")
# How to achieve both case sensitive comparisons and case insensitive comparisons within the language
# Case-sensitive comparison
if a < b:
 print("The first string is lexically before the second")
elif a == b:
 print("The strings are equal")
else:
 print("The first string is lexically after the second")
# Case-insensitive comparison using ascii_lowercase method
if a.lower() < b.lower():
 print("The first string is lexically before the second when ignoring case")
elif a.lower() == b.lower():
 print("Both strings are equal when ignoring case")
else:
 print("The first string is lexically after the second when ignoring case")
```
Note that Python handles comparison of numeric strings differently than Rust, as it treats them lexically rather than converting them to numbers. Here's an example of how to compare two numeric strings in Python:

a = "123"
b = "456"
if a < b:
 print("The first string is lexically before the second")
elif a == b:
 print("The strings are equal")
else:
 print("The first string is lexically after the second")

In this example, the output will be "The first string is lexically before the second", even though "123" is less than "456". This is because Python treats numeric strings as strings and compares them lexically.
As for other kinds of string comparisons provided by the language, Python has several built-in functions that can be used to compare two strings based on different criteria. For example, the `str.startswith()` method can be used to check if a string starts with a specific substring, while the `str.endswith()` method can be used to check if a string ends with a specific substring. Additionally, Python's regular expression library `re` provides various functions for searching and matching strings based on patterns.
