Python doesn't have an equivalent to the JavaScript ActiveXObject (which is used for accessing the file system), so you would have to use built-in libraries such as os or pathlib to read files in Python. Here is how you could do it:

```python
import os

# Getting size of a file in current working directory
file_path = './input.txt'
if os.path.isfile(file_path):
    file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
    print("Size of file in current working directory: ", file_size, "bytes")

# Getting size of a file in root directory
root_dir_path = '/input.txt'
if os.path.isfile(root_dir_path):
    file_size = os.path.getsize(root_dir_path)
    print("Size of file in root directory: ", file_size, "bytes")
```

This will print the size of the 'input.txt' file in both current working directory and root directory if it exists.
