In Python, strings are immutable which means you cannot change an existing (literal) string. However, there is a simple way to achieve this using concatenation along with slicing. Here's the equivalent code in Python:

```python
# Start by creating a string variable 
s = ", World"

# Prepend it with another string literal
s = "Hello" + s[1:]

print(s)
```
In this code, `s[1:]` is used to slice the string from index 1 onwards (excluding the first character), which effectively removes the comma. Then we concatenate "Hello" with the sliced string to create a new string that starts with "Hello". The print statement then outputs the resulting prepended string.
