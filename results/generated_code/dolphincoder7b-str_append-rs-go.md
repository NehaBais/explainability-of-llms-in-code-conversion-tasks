This is how you can convert the Rust code to Golang using the string append operation:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    var hello = "Hello world"
    fmt.Println(hello + "!!!!")
}
```
In the Golang version, you don't need to import any external libraries or use a `std` package as Rust does. The equivalent of `String::from` is creating a string literal directly in Go. `push_str` and `add` are not provided by the standard library in Go but can be simulated with `fmt.Sprintf`.

package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    var hello = "Hello world"
    fmt.Println(fmt.Sprintf("%s!!!!", hello))
}

The difference between Rust's and Golang's approach to string manipulation is that while Rust uses `&` for appending, Go uses `+`. You may find other differences depending on what you're trying to accomplish with your code.
