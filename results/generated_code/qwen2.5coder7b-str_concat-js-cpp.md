Here's how you can convert your JavaScript code into C++:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string s = "hello";
    std::cout << s + " there!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This program does exactly the same thing as your JavaScript code. It creates a string variable `s` and assigns it the value `"hello"`. Then it uses `std::cout` to print out `s` concatenated with another string literal `" there!"`.
