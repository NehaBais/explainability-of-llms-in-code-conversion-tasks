The Python code equivalent to your Java code would be as follows. We can use os module's os.path.isfile() and os.path.isdir() functions for checking if a file or directory exists in the filesystem. 

Here is the Python code that does the job twice, first one checks for current working directory and second one checks for files and directories in root:

```python
import os

# check if docs/input.txt exists in current working directory
print(os.path.isfile('docs/input.txt'))  # returns True or False

# check if docs/input.txt exists in filesystem root
print(os.path.isfile('/docs/input.txt'))  # returns True or False

# check if 'docs' directory exists in current working directory
print(os.path.isdir('docs'))  # returns True or False

# check if 'docs' directory exists in filesystem root
print(os.path.isdir('/docs'))  # returns True or False
```
Make sure to run these codes in the right context, e.g., running these scripts should be located in the same place where your input.txt and docs are located. If you want to check them at a different location, specify that path instead of using 'docs' and 'input.txt'. 

Note: These Python checks will work on Unix-like operating systems (like Linux or MacOS), but might not function as expected on Windows since it uses backslash `\` for directory separators whereas Unix-based OSs use forward slash `/`. However, both can be used interchangeably in these contexts.
