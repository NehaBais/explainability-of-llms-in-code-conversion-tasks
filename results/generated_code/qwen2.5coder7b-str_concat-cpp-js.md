Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your C++ code:

```JavaScript
var s = "hello";
console.log(s + " literal");
var s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```

In this script, we're using the `var` keyword to declare our string variables `s` and `s2`. We then use the `+` operator to concatenate strings (add them together), which is similar to the `std::string` concatenation in C++. The result of each operation is logged to the console with the help of `console.log()`, equivalent to `std::cout` in C++.
