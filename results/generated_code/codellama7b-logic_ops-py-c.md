Here is the C code that meets the requirements you specified.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int logic(bool a, bool b){
    printf("a and b: %d\n", a && b);
    printf("a or b: %d\n", a || b);
    printf("not a: %d\n", !a);
}
```
This function has the same functionality as the Python code you provided. It takes two boolean values, 'a' and 'b', performs logical operations on them, and then prints the results to the console using C's `printf` function.
