The given code is in C++ and it uses bitwise operators to perform operations on two integers. The equivalent of this code in Rust would look like the following. Note that Rust does not have bitwise NOT operator unlike C++, so it's negated using the unary operator "!". Here's how you can implement it:

```rust
fn main() {
    bitwise(10, 5);
}

fn bitwise(a: i32, b: i32) {
  println!("A and B: {}", A & B);
  println!("A or B:  {}", A | B);
  println!("A xor B: {}", A ^ B);
  println!("Not A:  {}", !A);

  // Note: The Rust shift operators are not guaranteed to work if the shift count (that is, b)
  // Is negative or is greater or equal to the number of bits in the integer being shifted.
  println!("A shl B: {}", A << b);
  println!("A shr B: {}", A >> b);
  let ua = A as u32;
  println!("A lsr B: {}", ua >> b);

  // there are no rotation operators in Rust, but we can use the bitwise xor trick to rotate.
  println!("A rol B: {}", (A << b) | (A >> 32 - b));
  println!("A ror B: {}", (A >> b) | (A << 32 - b));
}

```
In the above Rust code, we are using `as` keyword to cast i32 to u32 because Rust does not provide a built-in left rotation operator for integers. The bitwise xor trick is used to rotate the integer by `b` bits.
