Here's the equivalent Java code:
```java
public class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 String extra = "little";
 System.out.printf("Mary had a %s lamb.%n", extra);
 }
}
``` 
The output of this program will be:

Mary had a little lamb.

As you can see, the Java code does exactly the same thing as the C code, except that it uses string interpolation to replace the value of `extra` in the string with its actual value.
