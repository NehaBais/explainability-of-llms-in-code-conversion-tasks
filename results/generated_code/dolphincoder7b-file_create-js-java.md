To convert the JavaScript code to Java, we will need to understand how this JavaScript code works and how it can be implemented in Java. There are multiple ways to achieve what you're trying to do:

1. Using a single `try-catch` block for both `writeFile()` and `mkdir()`:

   try {
       // Create an empty file named "output.txt"
       Files.write(Paths.get("output.txt"), new byte[0]);

       // Create an empty directory named "docs" in the current working directory
       Files.createDirectory(Paths.get("./docs"));

       // Create an empty directory named "docs" at the root of the filesystem
       Files.createDirectory(Paths.get("/docs"));
   } catch (IOException e) {
       System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e);
   }


2. Using separate `try-catch` blocks for each operation:

   try {
       // Create an empty file named "output.txt" in the current working directory
       Files.write(Paths.get("./output.txt"), new byte[0]);

       // Create an empty directory named "docs" at the root of the filesystem
       Files.createDirectory(Paths.get("/docs"));
   } catch (IOException e) {
       System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e);
   }

   try {
       // Create an empty file named "output.txt" at the root of the filesystem
       Files.write(Paths.get("/output.txt"), new byte[0]);

       // Create an empty directory named "docs" in the current working directory
       Files.createDirectory(Paths.get("./docs"));
   } catch (IOException e) {
       System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e);
   }


3. Combining both methods:
```java
   try {
       // Create an empty file named "output.txt" in the current working directory
       Files.write(Paths.get("./output.txt"), new byte[0]);

       // Create an empty directory named "docs" at the root of the filesystem
       Files.createDirectory(Paths.get("/docs"));

       // Create an empty file named "output.txt" at the root of the filesystem
       Files.write(Paths.get("/output.txt"), new byte[0]);

       // Create an empty directory named "docs" in the current working directory
       Files.createDirectory(Paths.get("./docs"));
   } catch (IOException e) {
       System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e);
   }
```

These three options demonstrate different approaches to solving the problem and should suit your needs based on how you want to handle errors, what files and directories you're working with, etc.
