Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
def bitwise_and_or_xor_not_shift_rotate(a, b):
    print(f"a AND b: {a & b}")
    print(f"a OR b: {a | b}")
    print(f"a XOR b: {a ^ b}")
    
    # For NOT operator, we need to convert the number to unsigned integer because in Python 
    # it is not possible to apply bitwise NOT on negative integers
    a = a & 0xffffffff 
    print(f"NOT a: {~a & 0xffffffff}")

    print(f"a << b: {a << b}")  # left shift
    print(f"a >> b: {a >> b}")  # arithmetic right shift

    # Python does not have built-in operator for unsigned right shift and rotate, so we need to define these functions
    def unsigned_right_shift(a, b):
        return (a & 0xffffffff) >> b if a >= 0 else (a + 0x100000000) >> b
    
    def rotate_right(a, b):
        a = a % 0x100000000 # ensure it is within the int32 range
        left_shifts = unsigned_right_shift(a, b)
        return ((left_shifts << (32 - b)) | (a >> b))

    print(f"a >>> b: {unsigned_right_shift(a, b)}") 
    print(f"a ror b: {rotate_right(a, b)}") 
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It applies bitwise AND, OR, XOR on two integers, a bitwise NOT operation on the first integer, and left shift, right shift, unsigned right shift, rotate left and rotate right operations on the first integer with a shift/rotate amount of the second integer. Note that Python does not have built-in support for unsigned shift and rotate operations, so we need to define these functions ourselves.
