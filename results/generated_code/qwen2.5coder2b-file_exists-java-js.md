You can achieve this by using Node.js's `fs` module. First, you need to install the `fs` module if it hasn't already been installed:

npm install fs

Then, you can use the following code to check for the existence of the files and directories:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Check for input.txt in current working directory
fs.accessSync('./docs/input.txt', fs.constants.F_OK);
console.log('input.txt exists in current working directory');

// Check for /docs/input.txt in filesystem root
fs.accessSync('/docs/input.txt', fs.constants.F_OK);
console.log('input.txt exists in filesystem root');

// Check for another directory in current working directory
fs.accessSync('./anotherDirectory', fs.constants.F_OK);
console.log('anotherDirectory exists in current working directory');

// Check for another directory in filesystem root
fs.accessSync('/anotherDirectory', fs.constants.F_OK);
console.log('anotherDirectory exists in filesystem root');
```

The `fs.accessSync()` method checks if the file or directory exists synchronously. If it does exist, the function will not throw an error and will print a message indicating that the file/directory exists.

If you want to check for other directories or files, you can adjust the path accordingly:

Remember to replace `'./docs/input.txt'` and `'/anotherDirectory'` with the paths of the files/directories you want to check.
