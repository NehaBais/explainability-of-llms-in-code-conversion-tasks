This is how the Rust code would be converted to C. It's worth noting that in C, you won't be able to create empty directories as it depends on your system's filesystem implementation, which can vary between different operating systems. For this reason, the "docs" directory is created in the root of the filesystem.
```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <errno.h>

int create(const char *path) {
    struct stat st;
    if (stat(path, &st)) {
        if (mkdir(path, 0755)) { // create the directory and set permissions to allow read/write access
            fprintf(stderr, "Error creating directory: %s\n", path);
            return -1;
        } else {
            stat(path, &st); // get new stats after directory creation
        }
    }

    // create a file named output.txt of zero bytes 
    int fd = open(path "/output.txt", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0644); // truncate to empty (or create if not exists) the file with permissions 644
    if (fd == -1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error opening file: %s\n", path "/output.txt");
        return -1;
    } else {
        close(fd); // don't need the fd now, it's just a placeholder for simplicity
    }
    return 0;  // success case
}

int main() {
    if (create(".") == -1 || create("/") == -1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create either 'output.txt' or 'docs' in the current working directory\n");
        return 1;  // error case
    }
    return 0; // success case, if both files are successfully created
}
```
Do note that the "." and "/" paths will only work if they exist at the time of running this program.
