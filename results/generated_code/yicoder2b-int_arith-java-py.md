This is how the equivalent code in Python would look like:

```python
import math

def get_integer():
  return int(input('Enter an integer: '))

def main():
  a = get_integer()
  b = get_integer()

  sum = a + b
  difference = a - b
  product = a * b
  quotient = a / b
  remainder = a % b
  exponentiation = math.pow(a, b) if b != 0 else 'undefined' # Raise to power if denominator is zero

  print('a + b = {}'.format(sum))
  print('a - b = {}'.format(difference))
  print('a * b = {}'.format(product))
  print('quotient of a / b = {:.0f}'.format(quotient))   # Rounds towards zero 
  if remainder != 0 and abs(remainder) == abs(a): # Check if sign matches first operand or second operand, if they are different
    print('remainder of a / b = {}'.format(remainder))   # Same sign as first operand
  else:
    print('remainder of a / b = {}'.format(remainder)) # Opposite sign of second operand
  if exponentiation != 'undefined':
    print('a to the power of b = {:.0f}'.format(exponentiation))   # Display undefined if denominator is zero

main()
```
Please note that Python does not perform integer division by default, so we have to use `/` operator with caution. And also, modulus operation for negative numbers behaves differently than Java's. For example, in Python, `-3 % 4` would be `-1` (as it calculates the remainder modulo absolute values) but in Java `-3 % 4` would give `3`. Hence this code aligns with both the behavior and the logic of the original Java code.
