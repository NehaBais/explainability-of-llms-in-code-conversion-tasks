Sure, here's the equivalent JavaScript code for the given C++ code:
```
function printLogic(a, b) {
  console.log(`a and b is ${a && b}`);
  console.log(`a or b is ${a || b}`);
  console.log(`not a is ${!a}`);
}
```
This JavaScript function takes two boolean values `a` and `b`, and outputs the results of "and", "or", and "not" on these arguments using the logical operators `&&`, `||`, and `!` respectively. The `console.log()` function is used to print the output to the console.
