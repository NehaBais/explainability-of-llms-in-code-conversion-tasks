 To convert the given Python code to Rust, you can use the `std::fs` module to create files and directories. Here is an example of how you might do this:
```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let here = fs::File::create("output.txt").unwrap();
    let root = fs::File::create("/output.txt").unwrap();
    let docs = fs::DirBuilder::new().build("docs").unwrap();
}
```
Note that the `fs` module provides a number of functions for working with files and directories, including `create`, `mkdir`, and `rmdir`. In this example, we use these functions to create a file called "output.txt" in both the current directory and the root directory, and a directory called "docs". The `unwrap` method is used to handle any errors that may occur when creating or reading files.

Alternatively, you can also use the `fs::File::create()` function to create a file in the current working directory with the specified name, like this:

use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let output = fs::File::create("output.txt").unwrap();
}

This will create a file called "output.txt" in the current working directory and return a `fs::File` object that can be used to write data to the file.

To create a directory, you can use the `fs::DirBuilder::new().build()` function, like this:

use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let docs = fs::DirBuilder::new().build("docs").unwrap();
}

This will create a directory called "docs" in the current working directory and return a `fs::Dir` object that can be used to interact with the directory.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
