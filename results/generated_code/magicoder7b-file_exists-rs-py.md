 In Python, you can use the `os` and `os.path` modules to achieve similar functionality. 

Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
import os

for file in ["input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", "/docs"]:
    try:
        if os.path.isdir(file):
            print(f"{file} is a directory")
        elif os.path.isfile(file):
            print(f"{file} is a file")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"{file} does not exist")
```

This code checks if the directories or files in the list exist and prints out whether they are directories, files, or do not exist. The function `os.path.isdir` is used to check if a path refers to an existing directory, and the function `os.path.isfile` checks for files. If any of these functions raise a `FileNotFoundError`, it means that the file or directory does not exist and the corresponding message is printed out.
