Here's the Python code that meets your requirements:
```python
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))
if a < b:
 print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
elif a == b:
 print(f"{a} equals {b}")
else:
 print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```
To test this code, you can run it in a Python environment or editor that allows you to input integers and see the output. For example:
```
Enter the first integer: 5
Enter the second integer: 3
5 is less than 3
Enter the first integer: 3
Enter the second integer: 3
3 equals 3
Enter the first integer: 7
Enter the second integer: 4
7 is greater than 4
```
