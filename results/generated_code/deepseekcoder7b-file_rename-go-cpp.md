In C++, you don't need to specify the root directory if it is your current working directory. `std::rename` function from the Standard Library does this for you. Here's how you can do that in C++:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

int main() {
    // rename file "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the current directory
    if (std::rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0) {
        std::cerr << "Error renaming 'input.txt' to 'output.txt'\n";
    }
    
    // rename directory "docs" to "mydocs" in the current directory
    if (std::rename("docs", "mydocs") != <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>0) {
        std::cerr << "Error renaming 'docs' to 'mydocs'\n";
    }
    
    // rename file "input.txt" to "output.txt" in the root directory
    if (std::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt") != 0) {
        std::cerr << "Error renaming '/input.txt' to '/output.txt'\n";
    }
    
    // rename directory "docs" to "mydocs" in the root directory
    if (std::rename("/docs", "/mydocs") != 0) {
        std::cerr << "Error renaming '/docs' to '/mydocs'\n";
    }
  
  return 0;
}
```
Note: For this code, you need to run it as an administrator or with root permissions because you are trying to rename files and directories in the filesystem root. If you don't have these rights, `std::rename` will fail.
