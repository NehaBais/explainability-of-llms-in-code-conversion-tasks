Here is the Python equivalent of your Golang code:

```python
# text assigned to a string variable
s = "hello"

# output string variable
print(s)

# This output requested by original task description, although not really required by current wording of task description.
print(s + " literal")

# concatenate variable and literal, assign result to another string variable
s2 = s + " literal"

# output second string variable
print(s2)
```
