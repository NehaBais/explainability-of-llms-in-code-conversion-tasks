Here's the equivalent Python code that meets the requirements you've specified:
```
greeting = "Hello"
greeting += ", world!"
print(greeting)
```
In this code, we first create a string variable `greeting` and assign it the value `"Hello"`. Then, we use the `+=` operator to append the string literal `", world!"` to the end of `greeting`. Finally, we print the contents of `greeting` using the `print()` function.
