Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for the given C program:

```python
# Define the variable
extra = "little"

# Print the interpolated string
print(f"Mary had a {extra} lamb.")
```

In this Python code:
- We first define the variable `extra` with the value `'little'`.
- Then, we use f-string formatting to interpolate the variable `extra` into the string `"Mary had a {} lamb."`. The curly braces `{}` are used to indicate where the variable should be inserted into the string.
- Finally, we print the resulting string using the `print()` function.
