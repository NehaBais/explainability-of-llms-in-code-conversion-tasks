Sure, here's the equivalent Rust code:
```
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
 println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
 println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
 println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
``` 
Note that in Rust, the logical operators are represented using `&&` for "and" and `||` for "or", just like in Java. Also note that the "not" operator is represented using `!` as in Java.
