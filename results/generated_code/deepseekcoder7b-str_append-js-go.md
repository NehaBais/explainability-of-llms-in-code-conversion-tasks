In Golang, you can use `+` operator for string concatenation in a similar way as JavaScript using `+=`. Here's how to rewrite the given code snippet:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var s1 = "Hello"
	s1 += ", World!"
	fmt.Println(s1)
}
``` 
This will print `Hello, World!` to the console.
