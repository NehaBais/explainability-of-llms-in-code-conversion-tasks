To convert the Rust code to Python, we can use the shutil module of the os library in Python. This is because it provides a lot of utility functions for file handling operations. Here's how we can implement this:

```python
import shutil

# Rename "input.txt" to "output.txt" and "docs" to "mydocs" in current directory
try:
    shutil.move("input.txt",  "output.txt")
    shutil.move("docs",     "mydocs")

    # Same as above but for root directory
    shutil.move("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
    shutil.move("/docs",    "/mydocs")
except Exception:
    print("File move error")
```

In the above script, we are using the `shutil.move` function to achieve the file rename operations. The first two lines of the code perform renaming of "input.txt" to "output.txt" and "docs" to "mydocs", respectively in the current directory. The third line does the same but for the root directory (assuming the user has the necessary permissions).
The `shutil.move` function throws a `FileNotFoundError` if the source or destination file doesn't exist, so we don't need to check for such exceptions explicitly.
