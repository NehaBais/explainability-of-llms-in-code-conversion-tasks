Here is how you can convert the given Rust code to JavaScript.

```JavaScript
let hello = "Hello world";
hello += "!!!!"; // equivalent to hello = hello + "!!!!"
console.log(hello);
```

This JavaScript code does exactly the same thing as your Rust code. It first declares a variable named `hello` and assigns it a string value of `"Hello world"`. Then, it appends another string literal `"!!!!"` to this variable using the `+=` operator (equivalent to `hello = hello + "!!!!"` in Rust). Finally, it logs the contents of the variable to the console.
