I'm sorry for the confusion, but I can't translate your Rust code to Python because it's not valid syntax in Python. However, here is a simplified version of your Rust code that you could use in Python:
```python
def main():
    a = int(input("Please enter the first number:"))
    b = int(input("Please enter the second number:"))
    
    print("sum:", a + b)
    print("difference:", a - b)
    print("product:", a * b)
    print("integer quotient:", a // b)  # truncates towards zero
    print("remainder:", a % b)  # same sign as first operand
```
You can modify this according to your requirements. For example, you could add error handling and use Python's exponentiation operator `**`.
