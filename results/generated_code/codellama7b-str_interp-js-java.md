The code is in JavaScript and it needs to be converted into Java. In Java, you can use String.replace() method to replace "X" with "little". Here's the conversion:
```
String original = "Mary had a X lamb";
String little = "little";
String replaced = original.replace("X", little); //does not change the original string
```
The String.replace() method replaces all occurrences of a specified substring in this string with another specified string, creating a new string. In this case, it replaces "X" with "little". The result is a new string that is equal to "Mary had a little lamb".
