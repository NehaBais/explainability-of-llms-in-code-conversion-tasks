 Sure, here is the equivalent Java code to verify that a file called `input.txt` and a directory called `docs` exist twice: once for the current working directory, and once for a file and a directory in the filesystem root.

```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileChecker {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Check for the current working directory
        checkFileAndDirectory("input.txt", true);
        checkFileAndDirectory("docs", false, ".");

        // Check for the filesystem root
        checkFileAndDirectory("input.txt", true);
        checkFileAndDirectory("docs", false, "/");
    }

    private static void checkFileAndDirectory(String name, boolean isFile, String path) {
        File file = new File(path + "/" + name);
        if (isFile) {
            System.out.println("Checking if " + name + " exists as a file: " + file.exists());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Checking if " + name + " exists as a directory: " + file.isDirectory());
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code defines a `FileChecker` class with a main method that checks for the existence of the specified file and directory paths. The `checkFileAndDirectory` method takes two parameters, `name` (the name of the file or directory) and `isFile` (a boolean indicating whether to check if it's a file or a directory). It constructs a `File` object using the provided path and checks its existence or whether it is a directory.
