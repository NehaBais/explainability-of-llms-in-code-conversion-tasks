The equivalent code in Python would be:

```python
import sys

print("Enter two integers:")
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

if a < b:
    print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
elif a == b:
    print(f"{a} equals {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```
In the above Python code, we first take two integers from user input. Then, we compare these numbers using `if`, `elif` and `else` statements which are similar to Rust's `if-else` control flow structure.
