 Rust doesn't have a built-in way to perform file/folder operations like JavaScript does with ActiveXObject, but we can use the std::fs library for this purpose. Here is how you could implement it:

```rust
use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::{rename, rename_dir};
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // Rename in the current working directory
    rename("input.txt", "output.txt")?;
    rename("docs", "mydocs")?;

    // Rename in root filesystem ("c:\\" on Windows)
    let mut root_path = PathBuf::from("c:");
    root_path.push(std::ffi::OsStr::new("\\"));

    rename(root_path.join("input.txt"), root_path.join("output.txt"))?;
    rename_dir(root_path.join("docs"), root_path.join("mydocs"))?;

    Ok(())
}
```
Please note that you need to use the `std::fs::rename` and `std::fs::rename_dir` functions, as they allow renaming files and directories in a cross-platform way.

Make sure that your Rust program has permission to rename these files/directories. If not, it will fail with an error message.
