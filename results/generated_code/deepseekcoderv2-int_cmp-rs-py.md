 Sure, here's the equivalent Python code for the given Rust code:

```python
def main():
    # Get two integers from the user
    nums = []
    for _ in range(2):
        try:
            num = int(input().strip())
            nums.append(num)
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter valid integers.")
            return
    
    a, b = nums[0], nums[1]
    
    # Compare the two integers and display the appropriate message
    if a < b:
        print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
    elif a == b:
        print(f"{a} equals {b}")
    else:
        assert a > b, "This should never happen"  # Ensure a > b for the case where a is not less than or equal to b
        print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the following:
1. Prompts the user to input two integers.
2. Compares the two integers using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, displaying a message based on their relationship.
