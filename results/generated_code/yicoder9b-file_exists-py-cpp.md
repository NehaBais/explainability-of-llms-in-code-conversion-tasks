Sure, here is the equivalent C++ code using the <sys/stat.h> library:

This will be done twice also for current working directory and file in filesystem root:
- once for the current working directory,   and
- once for a file and a directory in the filesystem root. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include<sys/stat.h>

int main() {
    struct stat buffer;
  
    // Checking "input.txt" at current working directory
    if(stat ("input.txt", &buffer) == 0){
        std::cout << "File 'input.txt' exists in the current working directory.\n";
    } else {
       std::cout << "File 'input.txt' does not exist in the current working directory.\n";   
    } 
  
    // Checking "/input.txt" at root filesystem level 
    if(stat ("/input.txt", &buffer) == 0){
        std::cout << "File '/input.txt' exists in the filesystem root directory.\n";
    } else {
       std::cout << "File '/input.txt' does not exist in the filesystem root directory.\n";   
    }
  
    // Checking 'docs' folder at current working directory level 
    if(stat ("docs", &buffer) == 0 && S_ISDIR(buffer.st_mode)){
        std::cout << "Directory 'docs' exists in the current working directory.\n";  
    } else {
       std::cout << "Directory 'docs' does not exist in the current working directory.\n"; 
    } 
  
   // Checking '/docs' folder at root filesystem level 
    if(stat ("/docs", &buffer) == 0 && S_ISDIR(buffer.st_mode)){
        std::cout << "Directory '/docs' exists in the filesystem root directory.\n";  
    } else {
       std::cout << "Directory '/docs' does not exist in the filesystem root directory.\n"; 
    }   
    return 0;
}
```
This C++ program will check for a file named 'input.txt' and a directory called 'docs' both at the current working directory and also at the root level of your filesystem using `stat()` function from <sys/stat.h> library which is similar to os.path.isfile() and os.path.isdir() in Python. If file or directory exists, it will print a success message otherwise failure message.
