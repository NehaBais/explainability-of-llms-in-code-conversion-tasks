In Python, you can use the `os` module's `rename()` function to rename files or directories. Here's how you would convert that C code into Python:

```python
import os

# Rename files in current directory
os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt')
os.rename('docs', 'mydocs')

# Rename files in root directory
root = '/'
os.rename(f"{root}input.txt", f"{root}output.txt")
os.rename(f"{root}docs", f"{root}mydocs")
```

This script will work if the user has write permissions for both the current directory and root directory ("/"). 

Note: It's generally considered bad practice to rename a file or directory while it is still open, as you risk corrupting the file. It is better to close the file before renaming. The `os` module provides functions like `open()` that allow you to open and close files properly. However, for simplicity in this example, we assume that such operations are not needed when renaming files in Python.
