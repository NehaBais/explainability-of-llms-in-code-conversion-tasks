 Here's the equivalent code in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func renameFile(oldname, newname string) bool {
	// File (or directory) with old name
	file, err := os.Rename(oldname, newname)
	if file != nil {
		return true
	}
	return false
}

func test(typ, oldname, newname string) {
	success := renameFile(oldname, newname)
	fmt.Printf("The following %s called %s was renamed as %s.\n", typ, oldname, newname)
	if !success {
		fmt.Printf("The following %s could not be renamed into %s.\n", oldname, newname)
	}
}

func main() {
	test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt")
	test("file", "/input.txt", "/output.txt")
	test("directory", "docs", "mydocs")
	test("directory", "/docs/", "/mydocs/")
}
```

This Go code performs the same operations as the provided Java code: it renames a file and a directory twice, once in the current working directory and once at the filesystem root. The `renameFile` function checks if the renaming operation was successful by attempting to rename the file or directory using `os.Rename`. If the operation is successful, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
