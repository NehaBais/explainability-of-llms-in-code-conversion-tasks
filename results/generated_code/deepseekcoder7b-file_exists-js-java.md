Java does not have a built-in FileSystemObject equivalent as in Javascript, but you can use `Files` and `Paths` classes from Java to achieve the same functionality. 
Here is how you can do it using Java's NIO (New Input/Output) API:

```java
import java.nio.file.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Path currentDir = Paths.get(""); // get the current working directory 
        checkFileAndDirectoryExists(currentDir);
        
        Path rootDir = Paths.get("/"); // get the filesystem root directory
        checkFileAndDirectoryExists(rootDir);
    }
    
    public static void checkFileAndDirectoryExists(Path path){
        boolean exists = Files.exists(path, LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS);
        
        if (exists) {
            System.out.println(path + " exists");
        } else {
            System.err.println(path + " does not exist");
        }
    }
}
```
Note: 
- The `Files.exists()` method checks whether a file or directory exists. It returns true if the file/directory exists and false otherwise.
- If you want to also check for directories, use `Files.isDirectory()`. But in this context it's not needed as we are checking for existence which covers both files and dirs. 
- The method `LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS` is used to determine whether the file exists without following symbolic links - similar functionality can be achieved with Java but needs a little more code than Javascript's FileSystemObject.
