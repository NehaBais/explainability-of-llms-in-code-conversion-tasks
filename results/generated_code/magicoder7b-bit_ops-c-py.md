 In Python, the bitwise operations can be performed using `&`, `|` and `^` for AND, OR and XOR respectively. The not operator is represented as `~`. For left shift operation (`<<`), right shift operation (`>>`) with arithmetic shift or logical shift, we should use `* 2**b` to mimic the behavior of left shift in C. There's no direct rotation operations available in Python like the bitwise AND with a negative number (which rotates bits to the right) is performed in C, so I will provide an equivalent Python code using bitwise operations for left and right rotate.

Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    print("a and b:", a & b)
    print("a or b:", a | b)
    print("a xor b:", a ^ b)
    print("not a:", ~a & 0xFFFFFFFF) # bitwise AND with 0xFFFFFFFF to ensure it's an unsigned integer in case of negative numbers
    
    print(f"a << {b}:", a << b)
    print(f"a >> {b}:", a >> b)
    
    c = a & 0xFFFFFFFF # bitwise AND with 0xFFFFFFFF to ensure it's an unsigned integer in case of negative numbers
    print(f"c >> {b}:", c >> b)
    
    if (a < 0):
        print("Left rotate: ", ((-a) << b | (-a & ((1 << b)-1))) & 0xFFFFFFFF) # left rotation equivalent with bitwise AND and OR operations
    else:
        print("Right rotate:", a >> b | (a & ((1 << b)-1)) ) # right rotation equivalent with bitwise OR operation
    
    return 0
```

You can call the `bitwise` function like so: `bitwise(5,3)` for example. It performs all these operations on integer 'a' and 'b'.
