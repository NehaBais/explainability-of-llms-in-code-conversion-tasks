```
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <sys/stat.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    struct stat foo;
    stat("input.txt", &foo); // check the size of the file in the current working directory
    cout << "Size of input.txt: " << foo.st_size << endl;
    stat("/input.txt", &foo); // check the size of the file in the root directory
    cout << "Size of /input.txt: " << foo.st_size << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Note that the function `stat` is used to get information about a file, and it takes two arguments: the name of the file, and a pointer to a `struct stat`. The `struct stat` contains various fields that provide information about the file, such as its size. In this case, we are only interested in the `st_size` field, which gives us the size of the file in bytes.

In the C++ version, we use `std::stat` instead of the plain `stat` function, and we use `std::cout` to print the output instead of `printf`. We also use `using namespace std;` to avoid having to prefix all standard library functions with `std::`.
