 Certainly! Below is the equivalent Rust code for the provided Java code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = "hello";
    println!("{} literal", s);
    let s2 = format!("{}{}", s, " literal");
    println!("{}", s2);
}
```

Explanation:
1. In Rust, we declare a string variable `s` and initialize it with the value `"hello"`.
2. We use the `println!` macro to print the content of `s` concatenated with the string literal `" literal"`.
3. To concatenate strings in Rust, we can use the `format!` macro from the standard library, which is similar to how you would use the `+` operator in Java for concatenation.
