Here is the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
console.log(`Mary had a ${"little"} lamb`);

// You can specify order
console.log(`${"Mary"} had a ${"little"} lamb`);

// Or named arguments if you prefer
console.log(`${name} had a ${adj} lamb`);

```
Please note that in JavaScript, the placeholders for string interpolation are wrapped in backticks (` ` )). The placeholders can be replaced by variable values or expressions, enclosed in ${ }.
