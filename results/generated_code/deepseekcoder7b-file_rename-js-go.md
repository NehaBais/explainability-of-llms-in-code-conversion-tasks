The equivalent Go code for the given JavaScript would be as follows using os module of Go's standard library:

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
)

func moveFile(oldPath, newPath string) {
	err := os.Rename(oldPath, newPath)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}

func moveDir(oldPath, newPath string) {
	err := os<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>os.Rename(oldPath, newPath)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}

func main() {
	moveFile("input.txt", "output.txt")
	moveFile("c:/input.txt", "c:/output.txt")  // assuming c drive exists, you can use filepath.Join("C:", "input.txt") to generate full path if it's on Windows
	moveDir("docs", "mydocs")
	moveDir("c:/docs", "c:/mydocs")             // same here, C:\ is used in place of c:/ due to Go's standard library functions expect windows paths without the drive letter.
}
```
Please note that there are no direct equivalent methods for moving directories and files in Go as compared with JavaScript but we can use os module which provides some functionality like Rename(), Move() etc., 

This code assumes that you have the right permissions to perform these actions. If not, it will panic at runtime due to lack of required permissions. Error handling should be considered for production quality code. In addition, this script runs in Windows environment since "c:/" notation is used and Go's os module does not provide a way to handle file operations on Linux or MacOS environments natively. If you need to write cross-platform compatible code, consider using third party libraries like goose or filepath package of standard library which provides more abstraction for paths regardless platform.
