Here's how you can convert the given C code to JavaScript:

```javascript
function printLogic(a, b) {
    console.log("a and b is " + (a && b)));
    console.log("a or b is " + (a || b)));
    console.log("not a is " + (!a)));
}
```
This JavaScript function does exactly the same thing as the C function provided in the question. It takes two boolean values `a` and `b`, then outputs the result of "and" and "or" on both arguments as well as "not" on the first argument.
