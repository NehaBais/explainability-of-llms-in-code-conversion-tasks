Sure, here's the equivalent Rust code for your JavaScript function:
```rust
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a AND b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a OR b: {}", a || b);
    println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
}
```
This Rust code is equivalent to your JavaScript code in functionality and behavior. The Rust function `logic` takes two boolean values, `a` and `b`, and performs the logical operations "and" (`&&`), "or" (`||`), and "not" (`!`) on them. It then prints the results of these operations using the `println!` macro.
