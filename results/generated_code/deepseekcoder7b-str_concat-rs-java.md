Here is the equivalent Java code for your Rust program:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "hello";
        System.out.println(s);
        
        String s1 = s + " world";
        System.out.println(s1);
    }
}
```

In this Java code, a `String` object is created and assigned the value of "hello". Then another `String` object called `s1` is created which concatenates the original string with " world", resulting in "hello world". Both are then printed to the console.
