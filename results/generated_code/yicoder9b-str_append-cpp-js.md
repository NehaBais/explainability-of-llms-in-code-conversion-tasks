Here is the equivalent code in JavaScript:

```javascript
let greeting = 'Hello';
greeting += ', world!';
console.log(greeting);
```
In this JavaScript version of your C++ program, a string variable `greeting` is created and initialized with the value "Hello". The string literal ", world!" is then appended to it using the `+=` operator, which not only combines the original value of `greeting` with the new string but also reassigns the result back into `greeting`. Finally, the combined string stored in `greeting` is displayed on the console via the `console.log()` function.
