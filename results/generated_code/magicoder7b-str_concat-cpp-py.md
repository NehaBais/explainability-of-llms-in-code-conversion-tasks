 The equivalent code in Python would be:

```python
s = "hello"
print(s + " literal")
```
The `+` operator is used for string concatenation. After running this code, the output will be "hello literal". 

Note: This doesn't do exactly what the C++ version does because in Python we can directly concatenate strings unlike in C++ where we need to use `operator +`.
