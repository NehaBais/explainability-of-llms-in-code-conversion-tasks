The Java code to achieve the same functionality is as follows. Here, you'll need java.io and java.nio.file packages available in Java 8 or later versions.

Java Code:
```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { 
        File file1 = new File("output.txt");
        if (file1.createNewFile()) { // create a new empty file called "output.txt"
            Files.setPosixFilePermissions(Paths.get("output.txt"), java.nio.file.attribute.PosixFilePermission.OWNER_READ, 
                                          java.nio.file.attribute.PosixFilePermission.OWNER_WRITE); // permissions: rw-r-----
        }
        
        File file2 = new File("/docs");
        if (file2.mkdir()) { // create a directory called "docs" 
            Files.setPosixFilePermissions(Paths.get("/docs"), java.nio<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>ile.attribute.PosixFilePermission.OWNER_READ, 
                                          java.nio.file.attribute.PosixFilePermission.OWNER_WRITE, 
                                          java.nio.file.attribute.PosixFilePermission.OWNER_EXECUTE); // permissions: rwxr-x---
        }        
    }  
}
```
The Java code is pretty much the same as your C code but with some differences due to language syntax and methods used in java for file creation, permission handling etc. Please note that you need to add `throws IOException` while calling main method because createNewFile() and mkdir() can throw an IOException if something goes wrong.

As mentioned above, this will execute from the location of your Java class path. If you want to make it more generic, for example creating files in root directory, you'll need special permissions and probably won't be able to without using sudo or changing owner/permissions on the file system.
