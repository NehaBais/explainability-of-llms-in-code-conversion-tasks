The code is written in Python and it demonstrates various string comparison operations including lexical comparison, case-sensitive and case-insensitive comparisons, and comparing numeric strings.

Here's the Java equivalent of this code:
```
public static void compare(String a, String b) {
    System.out.println("a is of type " + a.getClass() + " and b is of type " + b.getClass());
    if (a.compareTo(b) < 0) {
        System.out.println("%r is strictly less than %r" + a + ", " + b);
    } else if (a.compareTo(b) <= 0) {
        System.out.println("%r is less than or equal to %r" + a + ", " + b);
    } else if (a.compareTo(b) > 0) {
        System.out.println("%r is strictly greater than %r" + a + ", " + b);
    } else if (a.compareTo(b) >= 0) {
        System.out.println("%r is greater than or equal to %r" + a + ", " + b);
    } else if (a.equals(b)) {
        System.out.println("%r is equal to %r" + a + ", " + b);
    } else if (!a.equals(b)) {
        System.out.println("%r is not equal to %r" + a + ", " + b);
    } else if (a == b) {
        System.out.println("%r has object identity with %r" + a + ", " + b);
    } else if (a != b) {
        System.out.println("%r has negated object identity with %r" + a + ", " + b);
    }
}
```
The `compareTo` method is used for comparing two strings, it returns an integer that indicates the lexical ordering of the strings. If the result is negative, then the first string is less than the second one, if the result is positive, then the first string is greater than the second one, and if the result is zero, then the strings are equal.

The `equals` method is used for comparing two strings in a case-sensitive manner, it returns true if the strings are equal, otherwise false.

The `==` operator is used to check if two objects have object identity, which means that they refer to the same object in memory.

The `!=` operator is used to check if two objects do not have object identity, which means that they refer to different objects in memory.

Note that in Java, you cannot compare numeric strings directly using the `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` operators, instead you need to use the `compareTo` method of the string class to perform lexical comparison.
