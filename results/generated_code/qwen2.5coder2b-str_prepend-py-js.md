Sure, here is the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
// Define your string variable
var s = "12345678";

// Prepend the string with another string literal
s = "0" + s;

// Print the result
console.log(s);
```
In this code we are using the `+` operator to concatenate the strings, which effectively prepends a '0' at the beginning of the string variable `s`. The `console.log()` function is used to output the value of `s` to the console.
