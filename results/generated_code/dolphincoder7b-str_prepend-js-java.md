This is the Java equivalent of your JavaScript code:
```java
// No built-in prepend
String s = ", World";
s = "Hello" + s;
System.out.println(s);
```
Note that the `print()` function in JavaScript has been replaced by `System.out.println()`. The `+` operator is used for concatenation, not appending. The resulting string variable `s` has now the value `"Hello, World"`. 

Also note that the code does not use any special features of Java, so it can be run on an Android device or a JVM-based system.
