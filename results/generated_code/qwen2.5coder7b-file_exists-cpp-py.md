Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for the given C++ code. This script will check if files and directories exist in both the current working directory and a specified path (filesystem root).

```python
import os

def file_exists(path):
    print(path)
    if os.path.exists(path):
        if os.path.isdir(path):
            print(" is a directory")
        else:
            print(f" exists with a size of {os.path.getsize(path)} bytes.")
    else:
        print(" does not exist")

# Check for files and directories in the current working directory
file_exists("input.txt")
file_exists("zero_length.txt")

# Check for files and directories in the filesystem root (Note: This part may not work on all systems due to permissions)
root_path = "/"
if os.access(root_path, os.F_OK):
    file_exists(os.path.join(root_path, "docs", "input.txt"))
    file_exists(os.path.join(root_path, "docs", "zero_length.txt"))
else:
    print("The filesystem root is not accessible.")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Importing `os` module**: This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.
2. **Defining `file_exists` function**:
   - Takes a path as an argument and prints it.
   - Checks if the path exists using `os.path.exists(path)`.
   - If it exists, it further checks if it is a directory using `os.path.isdir(path)`. If it's not a directory, it gets the file size using `os.path.getsize(path)` and prints it.
   - If the path does not exist, it prints that it doesn't exist.
3. **Checking in current working directory**:
   - Calls `file_exists` with `"input.txt"` and `"zero_length.txt"`.
4. **Checking in filesystem root**:
   - Constructs paths for `"docs/input.txt"` and `"docs/zero_length.txt"` under the filesystem root (`"/"`).
   - Uses `os.access(root_path, os.F_OK)` to check if the filesystem root is accessible.
   - If it is accessible, it calls `file_exists` with the constructed paths.

### Note:
- The script checks for the existence of `"docs/input.txt"` and `"docs/zero_length.txt"` under the filesystem root. Depending on your system's configuration and permissions, you may not be able to access certain directories or files in the root.
- If the filesystem root is not accessible, the script will print a message indicating that the filesystem root is not accessible.
