Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task:
```
import os
try:
 with open("output.txt", "w"):
 pass
 
 with open(os.path.join(os.sep, "output.txt"), "w") as f:
 f.write("")
 
 os.makedirs("docs")
 os.makedirs(os.path.join(os.sep, "docs"))
except IOError as e:
 print(e)
```
The `open()` function is used to create the files and directories, and the `IOError` exception is handled using a try-except block. The `os.sep` variable is used to get the operating system-specific path separator character.
