 Sure! Here's how you can convert the given JavaScript code to Python:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
s = "hello"

# Concatenate with another string literal
result = s + " there!"

# Show the content of the variables
print(result)
```

When you run this Python code, it will output: `hello there!`.
