Here is the converted code from Java to C:
```
#include 
void logic(int a, int b){
 printf("a AND b: %d", (a && b));
 printf("a OR b: %d", (a || b));
 printf("NOT a: %d", (!a));
}
```
In C, logical operators are used instead of the Java ones. The `&&` operator represents "and", the `||` operator represents "or", and the `!` operator represents "not". Additionally, the `printf()` function is used instead of `System.out.println()`.
