Here is your JavaScript code converted into Golang:

```Go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    var s = ", World"
    s = "Hello" + s
    fmt.Println(s)
}
``` 

The `+` operator in Go is used to concatenate strings, same as in JavaScript. The result will be `Hello, World` which gets printed out by the `fmt.Println()` function.
