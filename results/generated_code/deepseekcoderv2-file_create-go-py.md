 Sure! Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Go code:

```python
import os

def create_file(fn):
    with open(fn, 'w') as f:
        pass  # Create an empty file of size 0 bytes
    print("file", fn, "created!")

def create_dir(dn):
    if not os.path.exists(dn):
        os.makedirs(dn)
    print("directory", dn, "created!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_file("input.txt")
    create_file("/input.txt")  # This will fail on Windows due to permission issues
    create_dir("docs")
    create_dir("/docs")       # This might not work as intended depending on the filesystem
```

### Explanation:
1. **create_file(fn)**: This function creates an empty file named `fn`. The `open` function with mode 'w' is used to create the file, and since we don't write any content, it remains empty.
2. **create_dir(dn)**: This function creates a directory named `dn`. If the directory does not exist, `os.makedirs` is used to create it recursively.
3. **main** block: Calls both functions for creating files and directories in the current working directory and the filesystem root. Note that creating a file at the root level (`/input.txt`) might fail due to permission issues on some operating systems, especially Windows.
