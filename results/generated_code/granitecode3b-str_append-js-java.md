Here's the equivalent Java code:
```
String s1 = "Hello";
s1 += ", World!";
System.out.println(s1);
```
The `+=` operator is used to append a string literal to an existing string variable in Java. The contents of the variable are updated with the new value after the append operation. Finally, the `println()` method is used to print the contents of the variable to the console.
