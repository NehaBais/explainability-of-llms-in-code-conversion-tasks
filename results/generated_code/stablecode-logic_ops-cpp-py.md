Here's how you can convert the given C++ code to Python:

```python
def print_logic(a, b):
    print("a and b is ", (a and b)))
    print("a or b is ", (a or b)))
    print("not a is ", (!a)))
```

This Python function takes two boolean arguments `a` and `b`. It then prints the result of "and" and "or" on both `a` and `b`, as well as the result of "not" on the first argument `a`.
