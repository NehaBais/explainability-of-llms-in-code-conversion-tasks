 Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code for the provided Rust code:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder hello = new StringBuilder("Hello world");
        hello.append("!!!!");
        System.out.println(hello);
    }
}
```

In this Java code, we use a `StringBuilder` to create and manipulate the string variable. The `append` method is used to append additional text to the existing string. After the append operation, the contents of the variable are printed to the console.
