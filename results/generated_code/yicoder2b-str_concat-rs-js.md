Sure, here is the equivalent JavaScript code for the given Rust program:

```javascript
function main() {
    const s = 'hello';
    console.log(s);

    let s1 = s + ' world';
    console.log(s1);
}
```
This JavaScript function does exactly the same as the original Rust program: it declares a string variable `s` and logs its content. It also declares another string variable `s1`, which is the concatenation of `s` and " world". Finally, it logs both variables to the console.
