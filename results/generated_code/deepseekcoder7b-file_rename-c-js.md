The JavaScript language does not have a built-in function to do the directory renaming as C or other languages have, so we will be using Node.js with it's `fs` module which has methods for file and directory manipulation. Please note that rename() method in javascript only changes filename not paths, if you want to change path also then use fs.rename(oldPath, newPath) function of node.js:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');

// Rename from current working directory
fs.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt', function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File renamed to output.txt in the current working directory!');
});

fs.rename('docs', 'mydocs', function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Directory docs renamed as mydocs in the current working directory!');
});

// Rename from filesystem root, you will need admin/root access to do this:
try{
    fs.rename('/input.txt', '/output.txt', function (err) { 
        if(err) throw err; 
        console.log('File renamed to /output.txt in the filesystem root!'); 
    });
    
    fs.rename('/docs', '/mydocs', function(err) { 
        if(err) throw err;
        console.log('Directory docs renamed as /mydocs in the filesystem root!');
    })
} catch (e){
    //Handle errors here:
    console.error(e);
}
```

Please note that this script needs to be run with Node.js and it requires admin/root access on a Unix-based system, because you are trying to rename files in the root directory of your file system. If the script is being ran as an unprivileged user or inside a virtual machine without write permissions, then the operations will fail silently.
