Here is the Python code that creates an empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory called "docs" in the current working directory and in the filesystem root:
```python
import os
def create_files():
 try:
 # Create output.txt in the current working directory
 with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
 pass
 
 # Create output.txt in the root directory
 with open('/output.txt', 'w') as f:
 pass
 
 # Create docs directory in the current working directory
 os.makedirs('docs')
 
 # Create docs directory in the root directory
 os.makedirs('/docs')
 
 except Exception as e:
 print(e)
 
create_files()
```
In this code, we first import the `os` module to use its functions for creating directories and files. We then define a function called `create_files()` that tries to create the specified files and directories using Python's built-in `open()` function and the `makedirs()` function from the `os` module.
If an exception occurs while trying to create the files or directories, we catch it with an `except` block and print the error message. Note that we use the root directory separator (`/`) to specify the path to the output file and directory in the root directory.
