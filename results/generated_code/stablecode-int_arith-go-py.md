Here is the Python version of your code:

```python
# Get two integers from the user
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: ")))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: ")))

print(f"{a} + {b} = {a+b}")
print(f"{a} - {b} = {a-b}")
print(f"{a} * {b} = {a*b}")
# In Python, the division operator / returns a floating point number. If you want to get an integer result (quotient), you can use the floor division operator // which always truncates towards negative infinity.
print(f"{a} // {b} = {a//b}")  // truncates towards negative infinity
# To find out the remainder of a division operation, you can use the modulo operator %. The result of this operation is always non-negative and less than the absolute value of any of the operands.
print(f"{a} %% {b} = {a%b}")  // same sign as first operand
# Exponentiation in Python is done using the ** operator. This operator raises the number to an integer power, optionally multiplying it by a second operand (the base), which defaults to 1 if no argument for it is passed.
# Note: there is no exponentiation operator in Python (only ** operator). The code above does not include this part as it is not clear what you mean by "exponentiation". If you want to apply the exponentiation function on your variables, please clarify how you want the result of the operation to be displayed.
```
