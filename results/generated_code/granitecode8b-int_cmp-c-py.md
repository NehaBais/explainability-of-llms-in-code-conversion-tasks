Here's the converted Python code that meets the requirements:
```
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))
if a < b:
 print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
elif a == b:
 print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")
else:
 print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```
To test the code, you can enter different integer values for `a` and `b`, and check that the correct message is displayed based on their relationship. For example:
- If `a = 5` and `b = 7`, then the output should be "5 is less than 7".
- If `a = 10` and `b = 10`, then the output should be "10 is equal to 10".
- If `a = 12` and `b = 9`, then the output should be "12 is greater than 9".
