To convert the Rust code to C++, we will need to find a equivalent of the `std::ops::Add` trait in C++ and the `.add()` function call in Rust. Unfortunately, there is no direct equivalent in C++. We can still achieve the desired functionality by using the overloaded operator `+=` in C++.

Here's how you can do it:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string hello = "Hello world";

    // Method 1: Using += operator
    hello += "!!!!";
    std::cout << hello << std::endl;

    // Method 2: Using the append function of string object
    hello.append("!!!!");
    std::cout << hello << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Both methods will produce the same output, which is "Hello world!!!!" as expected.

In this case, you have a simple conversion from Rust to C++. However, in many cases, converting between languages requires additional work and attention to detail. You may need to handle some edge-cases or take care of possible differences in functionality and features.
