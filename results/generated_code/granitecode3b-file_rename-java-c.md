Here is the C code that accomplishes the task:
```c
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 char oldname[] = "input.txt";
 char newname[] = "output.txt";
 int success;
 // Rename file (or directory)
 success = rename(oldname, newname);
 if (success != 0) {
 perror("Rename failed");
 } else {
 printf("File renamed successfully\n");
 }
 return 0;
}
```
To run this code, save it to a file named `file_rename.c` and compile it using the following command:
gcc -o file_rename file_rename.c
This will create an executable file named `file_rename`. To rename a file in the current working directory, you can run the following command:
./file_rename input.txt output.txt
To rename a file in the root of the filesystem, you would need to use the full path to the file and directory. For example, if the input file is located at `/home/user/input.txt`, the command would be:
sudo ./file_rename /home/user/input.txt /home/user/output.txt
This will rename the file in the root of the filesystem without requiring administrative privileges.
