This Java code is attempting to rename a file called input.txt into output.txt and a directory called docs into mydocs. It makes use of the `File` class in Java's java.io package, which allows for operations on files and directories. The test method checks if it is possible to rename or create a new file/directory with the given names, then prints an appropriate message to the console.

Here is how you might write this in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
    char oldname[100] = "input.txt";
    char newname[100] = "output.txt";
    if(rename(oldname,newname)==0){
        printf("The file called %s was renamed as %s\n", oldname, newname);
    } else {
        printf("Could not rename the file %s\n", oldname);
    }

    char dirname[100] = "docs";
    char mydirname[100] = "mydocs";
    struct stat st;
    if (stat(dirname, &st) == 0 && S_ISDIR(st.st_mode)) { // If directory exists and is a directory
        if (rename(dirname, mydirname)==0){
            printf("The directory %s was renamed as %s\n", dirname, mydirname);
        } else {
            printf("Could not rename the directory %s\n", dirname);
        }
    } else {
        printf("Directory %s does not exist\n", dirname);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that C doesn't have native support for paths of length more than 99 characters or a way to distinguish files and directories from each other, so you will need to add those checks if you want your code to be portable across different platforms. Also, the `rename` function might not exist on all systems (like Windows), and therefore this code may need adjustments for these cases.
