The equivalent code in JavaScript would be as follows:

```javascript
let original = 'Mary had a X lamb.';
const toBeReplaced = 'X';
const replacement = 'little';

newString = original.replace(toBeReplaced, replacement); 
console.log(`String after replacement: ${newString}`);
```
This script does exactly the same thing as the C++ code. It uses JavaScript's built-in string replace method to replace a specific substring (the place holder "X") with another substring ('little') in our original string. The result is then logged out to the console.
