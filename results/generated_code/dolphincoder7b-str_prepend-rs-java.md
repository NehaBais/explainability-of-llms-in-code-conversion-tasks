Sure, here's the Java code that accomplishes the same task as your Rust code:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "World";
        s = "Hello " + s;
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```
In this Java code, we first create a string variable `s` with the value "World". Next, we concatenate the string literal "Hello " with the existing string value in `s` using the '+' operator and assign it back to the same variable `s`. Finally, we print out the final result.
