The JavaScript version of the given C code is as follows:
```
const extra = "little";
console.log(`Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`);
```
In this code, we use backticks (`) to define string interpolation in JavaScript. The `${}` placeholders represent expressions that will be replaced by their corresponding values or variables. In the provided example, `%s` is replaced with `extra`, which has the value of "little".
