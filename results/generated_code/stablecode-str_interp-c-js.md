Here is the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
var extra = "little";
console.log(`Mary had a ${extra} lamb.
`);
```

This JavaScript code does exactly what your C code does. It uses string interpolation to replace `%s` with the value of `extra`. The resulting string is logged to the console.
