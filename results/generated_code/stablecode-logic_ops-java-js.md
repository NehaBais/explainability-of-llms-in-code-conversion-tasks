Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your Java function:

```javascript
function logic(a, b){
    console.log("a AND b: " + (a && b)));
    console.log("a OR b: " + (a || b))));
    console.log("NOT a: " + (!a))));
}
```

In this JavaScript function, `a` and `b` are boolean values that you pass into the function when calling it. The function then performs several operations on these boolean values, including printing out their AND, OR, and NOT results to the console.
