Sure, here's how you can convert that JavaScript code into Python:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value.
s = ", World"

# Prepend the string variable with another string literal.
s = "Hello" + s

# Print the resulting string.
print(s)
```
This Python code does exactly what your JavaScript code does: it initializes a string `s` with some text, then prepends another string to `s`, and finally prints the final value of `s`.
