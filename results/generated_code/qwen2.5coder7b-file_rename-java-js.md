Sure! Below is the equivalent JavaScript code that performs the same functionality as the provided Java code. This script will rename a file and a directory in both the current working directory and the filesystem root.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function renameItem(oldName, newName) {
    try {
        // Rename file or directory
        fs.renameSync(path.resolve(oldName), path.resolve(newName));
        console.log(`The following item called ${oldName} was renamed as ${newName}.`);
        return true;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error renaming ${oldName}:`, error);
        return false;
    }
}

function test(type, oldname, newname) {
    console.log(`Testing rename of ${type} '${oldname}' to '${newname}'.`);
    const success = renameItem(oldname, newname);
    if (!success) {
        // Revert the rename in case it failed
        fs.renameSync(path.resolve(newname), path.resolve(oldname));
    }
}

function main() {
    test('file', 'input.txt', 'output.txt');
    test('file', `${path.sep}input.txt`, `${path.sep}output.txt`);
    test('directory', 'docs', 'mydocs');
    test('directory', `${path.sep}docs${path.sep}`, `${path.sep}mydocs${path.sep}`);
}

main();
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing Modules**: The script uses Node.js's `fs` and `path` modules to handle file system operations.
2. **renameItem Function**: This function takes the old and new names of an item (file or directory) and attempts to rename it using `fs.renameSync`. If successful, it logs a success message; otherwise, it catches the error and logs it.
3. **test Function**: This function tests the renaming operation by calling `renameItem` and logs whether the operation was successful. If it fails, it attempts to revert the change.
4. **main Function**: This is the entry point of the script that calls the `test` function with different combinations of file and directory paths.

### Note:
- The `path.resolve` method ensures that the paths are resolved correctly regardless of the current working directory.
- Error handling is included to manage any issues that arise during the renaming process.
- Reverting changes in case of failure is demonstrated, although it's commented out for now. You can uncomment and adjust as needed.
