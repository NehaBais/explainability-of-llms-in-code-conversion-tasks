Sure, here's how you can convert the Golang code into Python.

```python
def print_logic(a: bool, b: bool):
    print(f"a and b is {a and b}")
    print(f"a or b is {a or b}")
    print(f"not a is not {not a}")
```

In this Python function, `print_logic()`, two boolean values are passed as arguments `a` and `b`. It prints the result of "and", "or" on both arguments, and "not" on the first argument. The `f-string` (formatted string literals) is used to format the output.
