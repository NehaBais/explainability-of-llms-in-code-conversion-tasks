Sure! Here's the Java code that performs the same operation as the Rust code:
```java
public class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 String s = "hello";
 System.out.println(s);
 
 String s1 = s + " world";
 System.out.println(s1);
 }
}
```
This code creates a string variable `s` with the value of "hello" and then prints it to the console. It then concatenates this string with another string literal " world" using the `+` operator, creating a new string variable `s1` with the value of "hello world". Finally, it prints `s1` to the console as well.
