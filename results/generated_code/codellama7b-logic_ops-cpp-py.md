```
def print_logic(a, b):
    print(f"a and b is {a and b}")
    print(f"a or b is {a or b}")
    print(f"not a is {not a}")
```
Explanation:

* In Python, we can use the `and` and `or` operators to perform logical operations on boolean values.
* The `not` operator is used to negate a boolean value.
* We can use f-strings to print the results with proper formatting.
* Note that in Python, the `std::cout` statement is not needed since we are using the `print()` function instead.
