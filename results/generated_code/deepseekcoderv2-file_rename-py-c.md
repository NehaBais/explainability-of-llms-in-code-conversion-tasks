Answer: The Python code provided is used to rename files and directories in a file system. Here's the explanation of each line of the code and its equivalent C programming language implementation:

1. `import os`: This line imports the built-in module os which provides functions for interacting with the operating system. In this case, it will be used to perform operations on files and directories in a file system.

2. `os.rename("input.txt", "output.txt")`: Renames the file named 'input.txt' to 'output.txt' within the current working directory (cwd).

3. `os.rename("docs", "mydocs")`: Renames the directory named 'docs' to 'mydocs' within the cwd.

4. `os.sep + "input.txt"` and `os.sep + "output.txt"`: These lines add the separator (e.g., "/" or "\\" on Windows) before the filename/directory name, making sure that it is treated as a complete path within the file system. In this case, they are used to specify the full paths of files and directories to be renamed in the root directory.

5. `os.sep + "docs"` and `os.sep + "mydocs"`: These lines add the separator before the names of directories to be renamed in the root directory.

Here's a simple C code that implements the same functionality by using the system() function from the <stdlib.h> header file, which can execute shell commands on various platforms:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    // Rename files and directories in current working directory (cwd)
    system("mv input.txt output.txt");
    system("mv docs mydocs");

    // Add the separator character to specify the full path of files/directories to be renamed in root
    char cwd[FILENAME_MAX];  // Buffer for storing current working directory path
    getcwd(cwd, sizeof(cwd));  // Get the current working directory path and store it in 'cwd' buffer
    
    strcat(cwd, "/input.txt"); // Append "input.txt" to the end of the cwd string
    system("mv input.txt output.txt"); // Rename file "input.txt" as "output.txt" within current working directory (cwd)
    
    strcat(cwd, "/docs"); // Append "docs" to the end of the cwd string
    system("mv docs mydocs"); // Rename directory "docs" as "mydocs" within current working directory (cwd)

    return 0;
}
```
Please note that in C programming language, there is no direct equivalent for `os.sep` or `os.rename`, so I've used the system() function to mimic the behavior of these functions by executing shell commands using the command line interface (CLI).
