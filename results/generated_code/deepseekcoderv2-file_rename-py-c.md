 Here's the equivalent code in C that performs the same operations as your Python script, renaming files and directories both in the current working directory and at the filesystem root:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h> // for chdir()

void rename_file(const char *oldname, const char *newname) {
    if (rename(oldname, newname) != 0) {
        perror("Error renaming file");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Rename in the current working directory
    rename_file("input.txt", "output.txt");
    rename_file("docs", "mydocs");

    // Change to the filesystem root and perform the same renames
    if (chdir("/") == 0) { // chdir to root successfully
        rename_file("input.txt", "output.txt");
        rename_file("docs", "mydocs");
    } else {
        perror("Error changing directory to root");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function `rename_file`**: This function takes two arguments, the old filename and the new filename, and uses the `rename()` system call to rename the file. If the renaming fails, it prints an error message and exits with a failure status.
2. **Main Function**:
   - It first renames "input.txt" to "output.txt" and "docs" to "mydocs" in the current working directory.
   - Then, it changes the directory to the root (`/`) using `chdir("/")`. If this operation is successful, it performs the same renaming operations again. If not, it prints an error message and exits with a failure status.

### Compilation:
To compile this C program, you can use a command like:

gcc -o rename_script rename_script.c

Then run the executable:

./rename_script


This C code assumes that the user has sufficient permissions to perform these operations and handles errors gracefully by printing an error message and exiting if something goes wrong.
