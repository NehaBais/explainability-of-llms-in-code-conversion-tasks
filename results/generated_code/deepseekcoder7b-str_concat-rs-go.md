In Go, the equivalent code would be as follows:

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	s := "hello"
	fmt.Println(s)
	
	s1 := s + " world"
	fmt<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>.Println(s1)
}
```
The function `fmt.Println` is used for printing to the console in Go, similar to `println!` in Rust. For string concatenation, we use the '+' operator as it has been designed into the language from day one. The variable names start with a lowercase letter in Go (a convention referred to as camelCase), unlike Rust where variables and constants are capitalized by default.
