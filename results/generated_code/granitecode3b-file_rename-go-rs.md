Sure, here's the code in Rust that accomplishes what you described:
```
use std::io;
use std::fs;
fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
 fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt)?;
 fs::rename("docs", "mydocs")?;
 fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt)?;
 fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs")?;
 Ok(())
}
```
Note that the `?` operator is used here to propagate any errors that occur during file operations. If an error occurs, it will be returned immediately and the program will terminate.
