 To convert the given C code to C++, we need to replace the appropriate parts of the code with their C++ equivalents. Here's how you can do it:

1. Use `std::string` instead of raw character arrays.
2. Use `strcpy_s` or equivalent for string manipulation.
3. Include the necessary headers from the C++ Standard Library.

Here is the converted code in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstring> // For strcpy and strlen

int main() {
    std::string str = "my String";
    const char* cstr = "Changed ";
    char buffer[100];
    
    // Prepend the string literal to the std::string
    std::strcpy(buffer, cstr);
    std::strcat(buffer, str.c_str());
    
    std::cout << buffer << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Include Headers**: We include `<iostream>` for input/output operations and `<cstring>` (which is equivalent to `#include <string.h>`) for string manipulation functions like `strcpy` and `strlen`.
2. **String Initialization**: Instead of a character array, we use a `std::string` for the variable `str`.
3. **String Concatenation**: We use `std::strcpy` to copy the content of `cstr` followed by `str.c_str()` (which converts the `std::string` to a C-style string) into a buffer, and then concatenate them using `std::strcat`.
4. **Output**: Finally, we print the concatenated result using `std::cout`.

This code should work similarly to the original C code but is written in modern C++ standards.
