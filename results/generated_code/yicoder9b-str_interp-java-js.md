Here is how you can convert this Java code to JavaScript: 

```javascript
let adjective = "little";
let lyric = `Mary had a ${adjective} lamb`;
```
In Javascript, we use backticks (`) and ${} for string interpolation. This approach simplifies the process of replacing variables in strings with values.
