Here is the Python equivalent of your C code:

```python
# The initial string value
initial_string = "Good Morning"

# The first string literal to append
append_cstr1 = " to all"

# The second string literal to append 
append_cstr2 = " !!"

# Append the two strings
result_string = initial_string + append_cstr1 + append_cstr2

print(result_string)
```
In this Python script, we first define the initial text string and the two additional string literals to append. Then, we concatenate these three strings together in the order they are mentioned above (i.e., `initial_string` + `append_cstr1` + `append_cstr2`). Finally, this resulting string is printed out.
