I have successfully converted the given Java code to Rust. Here's the updated Rust code:
```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn rename_file(oldname: &str, newname: &str) -> Result<bool, io::Error> {
    fs::rename(oldname, newname)
}

fn test(type_: &str, oldname: &str, newname: &str) {
    match rename_file(oldname, newname) {
        Ok(_) => println!("The following {} called {} was renamed as {}.", type_, oldname, newname),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("There was an error renaming the file or directory: {}", e),
    }
}

fn main() {
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
    test("file", "/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs");
    test("directory", "/docs/", "/mydocs/");
}
```
You can use this Rust code as a starting point for your own renaming operations in your Rust programs.
