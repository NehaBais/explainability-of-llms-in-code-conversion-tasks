In Java, the equivalent code would be as follows:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
        rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
        rename("docs", "mydocs");
        
        // Assuming the current working directory is root (i.e., "/") 
        rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");  
        rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
    }
    
    public static void rename(String oldName, String newName) {
       File oldFile = new File(oldName);
       File newFile = new File(newName);
       
       if (oldFile.renameTo(newFile)) {  // If renaming was successful
           System.out.println("Renamed file " + oldName + " to " + newName);
       } else {
          System.out.println("Failed to rename file");
       }    
    }
}
```
The `renameTo()` method is a part of Java's File class, which changes the name or location of a file to the specified path. In this case, it attempts to rename oldName to newName and returns true if successful, false otherwise. 
Please note that in Java you cannot rename files across different filesystems (like from /input.txt to /output.txt) as they are on separate drives or partitions, so the second pair of operations will not be executed in this case. Also please make sure you have necessary permissions for these operations.
