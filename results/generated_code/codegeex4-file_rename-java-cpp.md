In C++, the equivalent code would look like this:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

bool renameFile(std::string oldname, std::string newname) {
    // Rename file (or directory)
    bool success = ::rename(oldname.c_str(), newname.c_str()) == 0;
    return success;
}

void test(std::string type, std::string oldname, std::string newname) {
    std::cout << "The following " + type + " called " + oldname +
        ( renameFile(oldname, newname) ? " was renamed as " : " could not be renamed into ")
        + newname + "."
        << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
    test("file", "/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs");
    test("directory", "/docs/", "/mydocs/");
    return 0;
}
```

Note: The C++ version uses the sys/types.h and sys/stat.h libraries for file system manipulation. Additionally, it calls ::rename() directly instead of creating a File object like in Java.

In this code, the function renameFile tries to rename or move a file or directory from oldname to newname, returning true if successful and false otherwise.

The test function prints whether the renaming was successful based on the return value of renameFile.

Finally, the main function calls test for both current directory and filesystem root. Note that the "/" prefix in paths is used to indicate the filesystem root.
Please note that file operations like these can sometimes cause errors if files or directories are in use, missing, or the user lacks the necessary permissions. It's also important to handle these cases properly in production code.
