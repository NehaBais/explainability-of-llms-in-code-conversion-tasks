 Certainly! Below is the Rust implementation that mimics the behavior of the Java code provided. This Rust code creates a directory and any missing parent directories, similar to the `mkdir -p` command in POSIX systems.

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let path = Path::new("C:/parent/test");
    match fs::create_dir_all(&path) {
        Ok(_) => println!("path successfully created"),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error creating directory: {}", e),
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing Modules**: We import the `fs` module from the standard library to handle file system operations and the `Path` module to work with filesystem paths.
2. **Creating a Path**: We create a path object for "C:/parent/test" using `Path::new()`.
3. **Creating Directory**: We use `fs::create_dir_all()` to create the directory and all its parent directories if they do not already exist. This function returns `Ok(())` on success or an error of type `std::io::Error` if it fails.
4. **Handling Results**: We handle the result with a match statement, printing a success message if the operation is successful. If there's an error (e.g., because the directory already exists), we print an error message using `eprintln!`.

This Rust code should work on any platform supported by Rust, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
