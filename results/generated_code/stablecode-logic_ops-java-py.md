Here is the Python equivalent of your Java code:

```python
def logic(a, b):
    print("a AND b: ", (a and b)))
    print("a OR b: ", (a or b)))
    print("NOT a: ", (!a)))
```

This function takes two boolean values as input. It then performs operations of 'and', 'or' and 'not' on the input arguments, just like your Java code does.
