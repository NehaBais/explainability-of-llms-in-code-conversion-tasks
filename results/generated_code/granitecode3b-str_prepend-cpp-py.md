Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task as the C++ code you provided:
```python
my_strings = ["prepended to", "my string"]
prepended = "".join(my_strings)
print(prepended)
```
This code defines a list of strings, `my_strings`, and uses the `join()` method to concatenate them into a single string. The resulting string is then assigned to the variable `prepended`. Finally, the `print()` function is used to output the value of `prepended` to the console.
