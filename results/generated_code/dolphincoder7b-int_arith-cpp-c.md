Below is the C equivalent of the given C++ code. Please note, there are no direct equivalents for features like error handling and operations on integers, so they will be left out in this example. The C version uses only basic arithmetic operations and mathematical functions to compute results.

```c
#include  <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    printf("a+b = %d\n", a + b);
    printf("a-b = %d\n", a - b);
    printf("a*b = %d\n", a * b);
    printf("a/b = %d, remainder %d\n", a / b, a % b);

    return 0;
}
```
