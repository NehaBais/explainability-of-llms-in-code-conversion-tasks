The Java version of the code can be written as follows:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileRename {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Renaming file and folder in current working directory
        renameFile("input.txt", "output.txt");
        renameFolder("docs", "mydocs");

        // Renaming file and folder at filesystem root (Requires appropriate permissions)
        try {
            File root = File.listRoots()[0];  // Get the first available drive
            renameFile(root.getAbsolutePath() + "/input.txt", root.getAbsolutePath() + "/output.txt");
            renameFolder(root.getAbsolutePath() + "/docs", root.getAbsolutePath() + "/mydocs");
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.out.println("You don't have permission to access this location.");
        }
    }

    public static void renameFile(String oldName, String newName) {
        File oldFile = new File(oldName);
        File newFile = new File(newName);

        if (!oldFile.exists()) {
            System.out.println("The file does not exist: " + oldName);
        } else {
            boolean success = oldFile.renameTo(newFile);
            if (success) {
                System.out.println("Renamed file to: " + newName);
            } else {
                System.out.println("Failed to rename file.");
            }
        }
    }

    public static void renameFolder(String oldName, String newName) {
        File oldDir = new File(oldName);
        File newDir = new File(newName);

        if (!oldDir.exists()) {
            System.out.println("The directory does not exist: " + oldName);
        } else {
            boolean success = oldDir.renameTo(newDir);
            if (success) {
                System.out.println("Renamed directory to: " + newName);
            } else {
                System.out.println("Failed to rename directory.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that Java does not support renaming of directories across filesystems without moving them. Therefore, the operation in the second 'here' is only possible within a single drive and requires appropriate permissions as well.
