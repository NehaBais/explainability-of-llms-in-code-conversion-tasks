Here is the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
// Create a string variable equal to any text value.
let s1 = "hello";

console.log(s1 + " world");

let s2 = s1 + " world";
console.log(s2);

s1 = "hello";
console.log(", ".join([s1, "world", "mom"]));

s2 = ", ".join([s1, "world", "mom"]));
console.log(s2);
```
This JavaScript code does exactly the same thing as your Python code. It creates two string variables `s1` and `s2`. The value of `s1` is set to "hello". Then the content of the variables are printed out.
