Here's how you can convert the given C code into Python:
```python
# Get two integers from the user
a = int(input("Enter first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter second integer: "))

# Test each condition separately
if a < b:
    print(f"{a} is less than {b}")

if a == b:
    print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")

if a > b:
    print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```
This Python code does exactly the same as your C code. It prompts the user for two integers, then checks if the first integer is less than, equal to, or greater than the second one and displays an appropriate message for each case.
