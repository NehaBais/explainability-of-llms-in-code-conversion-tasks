Here's how you can do it in JavaScript:
```javascript
const adjective = 'big';
const lyric = `Mary had a ${adjective} lamb`;
console.log(lyric); // Mary had a big lamb
```
In JavaScript, we use backticks (`) for string interpolation. We can directly insert the variable `adjective` into the string using `${adjective}`. The resulting string will be "Mary had a big lamb".
