Here's the Python code that fulfills the given requirements:
```python
a = int(input("Enter first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter second integer: "))
if a < b:
 print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
elif a == b:
 print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")
else:
 print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
```
To test the code, you can run it and enter different integers for `a` and `b`. The output will indicate which condition is true based on the comparison between the two integers.
