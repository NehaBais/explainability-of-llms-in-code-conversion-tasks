In Python, you can use the built-in `and`, `or`, and `not` operators to perform operations on boolean values. In addition, the `print` function in Python does not require the `printf` function call syntax. Here is a Python version of your code:

```python
def print_logic(a, b):
    print("a and b is", a and b)
    print("a or b is", a or b)
    print("not a is", not a)
```

In this code, the `print` function in Python uses string formatting to replace the `%d` placeholders with the values of the arguments.
