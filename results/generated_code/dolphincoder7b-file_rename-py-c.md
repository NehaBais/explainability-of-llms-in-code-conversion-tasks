The Python code can be converted to C using the following syntax:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h> // for rename()

int main() {
    // First, rename "input.txt" to "output.txt", assuming that you are currently in the current working directory
    if (rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0) {
        printf("Failed to rename input.txt to output.txt\n");
        return -1; // Exit with an error code
    }

    // Then, rename the directory "docs" to "mydocs", assuming that you are currently in the filesystem root
    if (rename("/home/user/docs", "/home/user/mydocs") != 0) {
        printf("Failed to rename /home/user/docs to /home/user/mydocs\n");
        return -1; // Exit with an error code
    }

    // Next, rename "input.txt" to "output.txt", assuming that you are currently in the filesystem root
    if (rename("/home/user/input.txt", "/home/user/output.txt") != 0) {
        printf("Failed to rename /home/user/input.txt to /home/user/output.txt\n");
        return -1; // Exit with an error code
    }

    // Finally, rename the directory "docs" to "mydocs", assuming that you are currently in the filesystem root
    if (rename("/home/user/docs", "/home/user/mydocs") != 0) {
        printf("Failed to rename /home/user/docs to /home/user/mydocs\n");
        return -1; // Exit with an error code
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Note that the paths in the C program are specific to your system and should be replaced with the appropriate directory and file paths. The `rename` function is used for renaming files and directories in C, which follows POSIX standards.
