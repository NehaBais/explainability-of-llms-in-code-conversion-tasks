 Here is the JavaScript version of your C++ code:

```JavaScript
let s = "hello";
console.log(s + " literal");
let s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```
The JavaScript version does exactly the same thing as the provided C++ code. It declares a string variable `s` with value `"hello"`, then uses `console.log()` to output both `s` concatenated with `" literal"` and `s2` (the result of `s + " literal"`). The output will be `helloworld` for the first line and `hello literal` for the second line.
