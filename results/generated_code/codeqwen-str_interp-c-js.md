The equivalent code in JavaScript would be:

```javascript
let string = "Mary had a X lamb.";
let word = "big";
let result = string.replace('X', word);
console.log(result);
```
This JavaScript code takes an original string, assigns it to the variable `string`, and then defines another variable called `word` with the value "big". The `replace` function is used on the `string` variable, replacing any occurrence of 'X' (the character we want to replace) with the contents of the `word` variable. The result is stored in the `result` variable, which is then logged to the console using `console.log`.
