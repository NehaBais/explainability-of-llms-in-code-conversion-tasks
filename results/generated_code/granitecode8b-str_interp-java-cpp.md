Here is the equivalent code in C++:
```
#include 
#include 
int main() {
 std::string adjective = "big";
 std::string lyric = "Mary had a " + adjective + " lamb";
 return 0;
}
```
In this example, we first include the necessary headers for string manipulation. We then define two strings: `adjective` and `lyric`. The `adjective` is set to `"big"`, while the `lyric` is constructed using string concatenation with the value of `adjective`. Note that in C++, the `%s` format specifier is used for strings, rather than the Java-style `%`.
