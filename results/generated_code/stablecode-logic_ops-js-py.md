Here is the Python equivalent of your JavaScript function:

```python
def logic(a,b): 
    print("a AND b: ", (a and b)))
    print("a OR b: ", (a or b)))
    print("NOT a: ", (!(a))))
```

This Python function works exactly the same way as your JavaScript function. The print statements are also identical in both languages, demonstrating that this simple translation is accurate.
