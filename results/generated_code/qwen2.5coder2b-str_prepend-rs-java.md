Sure! Below is the equivalent Java code that performs the same operations as the Rust code you provided:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a string variable equal to any text value
        String s = "World";

        // Prepend the string variable with another string literal
        s = "Hello " + s;

        // Print the modified string
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```

This Java code does exactly what the Rust code does. It creates a `String` object named `s`, initializes it with the value "World", prepends "Hello " to it, and then prints the resulting string.
