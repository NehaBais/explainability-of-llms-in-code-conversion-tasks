Here's the equivalent Python code:
```
string = "abc"
string = "def" + string
```
In this example, we first create a string variable called `string` and assign it the value `"def"`. We then use the concatenation operator (`+`) to prepend the string literal `"abc"` to the value of `string`. The result is stored back in `string`, becoming `"abcdef"`.
