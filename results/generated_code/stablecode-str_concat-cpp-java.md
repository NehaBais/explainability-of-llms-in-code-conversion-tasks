Here is the Java equivalent of your C++ code:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "hello";
        System.out.println(s + " literal"));

        String s2 = s + " literal";
        System.out.println(s2);
    }
}
```
This Java code does the same thing as your C++ code: it creates a string variable `s` equal to "hello", concatenates " literal" with `s`, and assigns the result to a new string variable `s2`. It then prints out the contents of both variables.
