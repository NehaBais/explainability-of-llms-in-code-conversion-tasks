 Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided JavaScript function. This code will prompt the user to input two integers and then compare them based on their values using comparison operators:

```python
def compare(a, b):
    if a == b:
        print(f"{a} equals {b}")
    elif a < b:
        print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
    elif a > b:
        print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
    else:
        print(f"{a} and {b} are not of the same type and cannot be compared.")

# Get input from the user
try:
    a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
    b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter valid integers.")
else:
    compare(a, b)
```

This Python script uses a function `compare` to check if two numbers are equal, less than, or greater than each other. It also handles cases where the input is not an integer and provides appropriate error handling for invalid inputs.
