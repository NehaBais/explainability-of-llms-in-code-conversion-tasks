 Rust doesn't have built-in functionality to create empty files and directories in the same way JavaScript does using `fs` module (as shown above). However, we can use the `std::fs` module to perform similar operations. Here is a simple code snippet that accomplishes creating an "output.txt" file of size 0 bytes and a "docs" directory both in current working directory and root filesystem:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    fs::write("output.txt", "")?;
    fs::create_dir("docs")?;
    fs::create_dir("/docs")?;
    Ok(())
}
```
Please note that Rust does not have a concept of "root directory" like in JavaScript's `/`. In Rust, the absolute filesystem root is represented by an empty string `""` instead of `"/"`.
