Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your C code:

```javascript
let str = "Good Morning";
const cstr1 = " to all";
const cstr2 = " !!!";

// Check if there's enough space for concatenation. Since in JS strings are dynamic, we don't need to worry about insufficient space.
if(true) {
    // Method 1: Use JavaScript's built-in concat method.
    str = str.concat(cstr1);
    
    // Method 2: We can use the plus operator (+).
    str = str + cstr2;
  
    console.log(str);
}
```

In JavaScript, strings are dynamic and automatically handle space allocation. So we don't need to worry about insufficient space like in C. The size of a string in JavaScript can grow dynamically when characters are added beyond the original capacity of the variable which was declared while initializing it. Therefore, there is no need for an explicit check or malloc-like function to reserve memory as we did in C (as shown above). Instead, you simply concatenate strings using `+` operator. The console.log() statement will print the final string value after appending.
