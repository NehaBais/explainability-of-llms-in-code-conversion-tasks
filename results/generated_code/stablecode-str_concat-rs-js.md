Here is the equivalent JavaScript code:

```javascript
// Create a string variable equal to any text value.
var s = "hello".to_owned();
console.log(s);  // To show the content of the variables.

// Create another string variable whose value is the original 
// variable concatenated with another string literal.
var s1 = s + " world";
console.log(s1); // To show the content of the second variable.
```

Please note that Rust and JavaScript handle strings differently due to their underlying implementations. The presented JavaScript code is a direct translation from the provided Rust code snippet, maintaining the same functionality.
