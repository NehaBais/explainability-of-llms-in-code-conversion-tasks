Sure! Here is the equivalent Rust code for the given Java code:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn rename_file(old_name: &str, new_name: &str) -> bool {
    let old_path = Path::new(old_name);
    let new_path = Path::new(new_name);

    fs::rename(&old_path, &new_path).is_ok()
}

fn test(type_str: &str, old_name: &str, new_name: &str) {
    println!(
        "The following {} called {} {}.",
        type_str,
        old_name,
        if rename_file(old_name, new_name) {
            format!("was renamed as {}", new_name)
        } else {
            format!("could not be renamed into {}", new_name)
        }
    );
}

fn main() {
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
    test("file", "/", "/output.txt");
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs");
    test("directory", "/", "/mydocs");
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing necessary modules**: We import `std::fs` for file operations and `std::path::Path` to handle file paths.
2. **Function `rename_file`**:
   - This function takes two string slices (`&str`) representing the old and new names of the file or directory.
   - It constructs `Path` objects from these strings.
   - It uses `fs::rename` to rename the file or directory and returns a boolean indicating success.
3. **Function `test`**:
   - This function takes a string slice for the type, old name, and new name of the file or directory.
   - It prints whether the renaming was successful based on the return value of `rename_file`.
4. **Main function**:
   - Calls `test` with different scenarios, including renaming in the current working directory and the filesystem root.

This Rust code should accomplish the same tasks as the provided Java code.
