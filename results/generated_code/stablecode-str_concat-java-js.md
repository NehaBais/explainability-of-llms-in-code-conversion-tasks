Here is the Java code converted to JavaScript:

```javascript
// Create a string variable equal to any text value.
let s = "hello";
console.log(s + " literal"));

// Create another string variable whose value is the original variable concatenated with another string literal.
let s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
```
This JavaScript code performs the same operations as your given Java code. It creates two string variables, `s` and `s2`, where `s` is initialized to "hello" and `s2` is initialized to the concatenation of `s` and a literal string " literal". Finally, it logs both `s` and `s2`.
