Here's the Python code that fulfills the requirement:
```
# Create a string variable equal to any text value
s = "hello"
# Concatenate another string literal to the original variable
t = s + " there!"
# Print the contents of both variables
print(s)
print(t)
```
This code creates two string variables, `s` and `t`, with values "hello" and "hello there!", respectively. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the two strings, and the resulting value is assigned to `t`. Finally, the contents of both variables are printed using the `print()` function.
