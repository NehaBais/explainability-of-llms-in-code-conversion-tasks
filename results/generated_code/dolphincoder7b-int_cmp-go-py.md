The Python version of the given code is as follows:

```python
def main():
    n1 = int(input("enter number: "))
    n2 = int(input("enter number: "))

    if n1 < n2:
        print(f"{n1} less than {n2}")
    elif n1 == n2:
        print(f"{n1} equal to {n2}")
    else:
        print(f"{n1} greater than {n2}")
```

You can use the above code in your Python program and test it with different inputs. The `input` function will prompt you for input, which you can then pass to the `main` function as arguments. This allows you to easily test different scenarios without needing to actually run the code.
