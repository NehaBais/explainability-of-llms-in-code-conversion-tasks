The equivalent Go code for the given Rust code is as follows:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	hello := "Hello world"
	fmt.Println(hello + "!!!!"))
}
```
In this Go code, we first declare a string variable `hello` and initialize it with the value "Hello world". 

Next, we use the `fmt.Println()` function to print the contents of the `hello` variable after appending the string literal "!!!!" to it.

The output of this Go code will be:

Hello world!!!!
