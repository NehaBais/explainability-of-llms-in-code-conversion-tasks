Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your C++ program:

```javascript
let s = "hello";
console.log(s + " literal");
let s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s2);
``` 

In this piece of code, we define two variables `s` and `s2` respectively equal to the string `"hello"` and the result of concatenating a string with another one (i.e., " literal"). Then we print out these variables using console logging statements.
