In Java, you can use the `java.nio.file` package to interact with the file system. Here is an equivalent code in Java for your given Python code:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // For current working directory
        Path pathCurrent = Paths.get("input.txt");
        File fileCurrent = new File(pathCurrent.toString());
        System.out.println("File exists in current directory: " + fileCurrent.exists());

        Path dirPathCurrent = Paths.get("docs");
        File dirCurrent = new File(dirPathCurrent.toString());
        System.out.println("Directory exists in current directory: " + dirCurrent.exists());

        // For filesystem root
        Path pathRoot = Paths.get("/input.txt");
        File fileRoot = new File(pathRoot.toString());
        System.out.println("File exists in the root: " + fileRoot.exists());

        Path dirPathRoot = Paths.get("/docs");
        File dirRoot = new File(dirPathRoot.toString());
        System.out.println("Directory exists in the root: " + dirRoot.exists());
    }
}
```
Please, note that for directory and file existence check you should have the correct permissions. If you don't have permission to access certain directories or files, it will return false even if they actually exist.

Also, remember that different operating systems may use different paths as their root directories. In Windows, it's usually "\\", while in Unix-based systems (like Linux and MacOS) it's "/". 

Lastly, please be aware that Java is case-sensitive when dealing with filenames and directory names, so "Input.txt" is not the same as "input.txt", or "/Docs/" is not the same as "/docs/".
