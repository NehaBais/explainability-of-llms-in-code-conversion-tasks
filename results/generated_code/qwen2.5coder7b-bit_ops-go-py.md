Here is the equivalent Python code for the given Golang code:
```python
def bitwise(a, b):
    print(f"a:   {a:016b}")
    print(f"b:   {b:016b}")

    # Bitwise logical operations
    print(f"and: {a & b:016b}")
    print(f"or:  {a | b:016b}")
    print(f"xor: {a ^ b:016b}")
    print(f"not: {~a:016b}")

    if b < 0:
        print("Right operand is negative, but all shifts require an unsigned right operand (shift distance).")
        return

    # Logical shifts (unsigned left operand)
    print(f"shl: {(a << b):016b}")
    print(f"shr: {(a >> b):016b}")

    # Arithmetic shifts (signed left operand)
    print(f"las: {((a << b) & 0xFFFF):016b}")
    print(f"ras: {(((a >> b) + ((1 << (15 - b)) * (a < 0))) & 0xFFFF):016b}")

    # Rotations
    print(f"rol: {(a << b | a >> (16 - b)):016b}")
    print(f"ror: {((a >> b | (a << (16 - b)))) & 0xFFFF:016b}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    a, b = -460, 6
    bitwise(a, b)
```

In the Python version:
- The `int` type in Python is equivalent to `int16` in Golang.
- Bitwise operations are directly supported using `&`, `|`, and `^`.
- The `~` operator performs a bitwise NOT operation.
- Logical shifts (`<<` and `>>`) are performed directly as bitshift operations.
- Arithmetic shifts for signed integers are simulated by ensuring the result stays within the 16-bit range after shifting.
- Rotations are implemented using bitwise operations. Note that Python's bitwise operators work on integers, and they handle negative numbers by treating them in two's complement representation.
