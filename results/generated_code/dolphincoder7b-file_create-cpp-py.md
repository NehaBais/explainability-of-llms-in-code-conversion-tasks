The provided C++ code is already in Python and does not require any further conversion to be executed as a Python program. However, the tasks can still be accomplished in Python using the `os` module:
```python
import os

# Create an empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes
with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    pass

# Create an empty directory called "docs"
os.mkdir("docs")

# The filesystem root is represented by "/" in Unix-like systems like Linux and MacOS, so the code to create a directory at the root of the file system can be written as follows:
os.mkdir("/docs")
```
This solution uses the `open()` function to open or create an empty file called "output.txt" and closes it after creation. The `os.mkdir()` function is used to create an empty directory named "docs". For creating directories at the root of the filesystem, the "/docs" path is passed to the `os.mkdir()` function.
