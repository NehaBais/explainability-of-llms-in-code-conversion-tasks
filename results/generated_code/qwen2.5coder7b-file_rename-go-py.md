Here is the equivalent Python code for your requirement:

```python
import os

def rename_files_and_directory():
    # Rename in current working directory
    os.rename('input.txt', 'output.txt')
    os.rename('docs', 'mydocs')

    # Change to root directory and then rename files and directory there
    os.chdir('/')
    os.rename('/input.txt', '/output.txt')
    os.rename('/docs', '/mydocs')

# Call the function
rename_files_and_directory()
```

Please note that in Python, unlike Go, there is no direct way to change directories using a relative path like in Go. So, we first use `os.chdir('/')` to switch to the root directory before doing the renaming.

Also, be aware that running this script with insufficient permissions could result in errors or permission denied exceptions. Always ensure you have appropriate permissions when operating on system files and directories.
