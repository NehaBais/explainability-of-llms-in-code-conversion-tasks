Here's the equivalent Java code for creating a directory and any missing parents:
```
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
public class DirectoryCreator {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Path path = Paths.get("./path/to/dir");
 try {
 Files.createDirectories(path);
 } catch (Exception e) {
 System.out.println("An Error Occurred!");
 }
 }
}
```
In this Java code, we first create a `Path` object representing the directory path. We then use the `Files.createDirectories()` method to create the directory and any missing parents. If an exception is thrown, we catch it and print an error message. Note that this implementation uses the NIO.2 API, which was introduced in Java 7.
