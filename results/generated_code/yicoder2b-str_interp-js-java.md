The equivalent code in Java would be:

```java
String original = "Mary had a X lamb";
String little = "little";
String replaced = original.replace("X", little); //changes the original string
System.out.println(replaced);
``` 
This code will output: "Mary had a little lamb" which is a replacement of "X" in the original string with 'little'.
