This is a code conversion assistant. Here's the converted version of the C code to Python:

Python Code:
```python
def substring(s, n, m):
    # check for null s
    if not s:
        return None
    
    # negative m means "up to the mth char from right"
    if m < 0:
        m = len(s) + m - n + 1
    
    # n and m cannot be negative, invalid case
    if n < 0 or m < 0:
        return None
    
    # make sure string does not end before n
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '\x00':
            return None
            
    result = bytearray(m+1)
    result[0]=''
    
    strncat(result, s, m)
    # strncat adds a null terminator after reading m characters if string ends early
    return bytes(result[:-1]).decode('utf8')
            
def str_wholeless1(s):
    return substring(s, 0, len(s)-1)

def str_fromch(s, ch, m):
    return substring(s, s.index(ch), m)

def str_fromstr(s, inp, m):
    return substring(s, s.find(inp), m)
```
This Python code includes the same logic as the C version. Note that Python's bytearray is equivalent to char* in C, and strncat adds a null terminator after reading m characters if string ends early. The Python's "index" and "find" functions are equivalent to C's "strchr" and "strstr" respectively. Please be aware this code will only work with UTF-8 or UTF-16 as it doesnâ€™t reference 8-bit code units, and it handles all valid Unicode characters.
