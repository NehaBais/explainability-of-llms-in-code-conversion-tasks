The equivalent JavaScript code for the given C code is:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// rename in current directory
try {
  fs.renameSync('input.txt', 'output.txt');
  fs.renameSync('docs', 'mydocs');
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}

// rename in root directory
try {
  fs.renameSync('/input.txt', '/output.txt');
  fs.renameSync('/docs', '/mydocs');
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}
```
This JavaScript code uses the Node.js file system module (`fs`) to perform the renaming operations. The `renameSync` function is used instead of `rename` as it performs synchronously which is similar to how the C program operates.

Please note that due to restrictions in Unix-based systems, most Node.js applications don't have permission to rename files at root level. You need superuser/root privileges to operate in the filesystem root directory and it may not work in non-Unix-like operating system.

Also, remember to execute this script with Node.js, because JavaScript by itself does not have such functionality included in its standard library.

This code assumes that the specified files or directories exist at the given locations. If they do not, an error will be thrown. The `try...catch` blocks are used to handle these potential errors gracefully.
