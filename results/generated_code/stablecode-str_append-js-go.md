Here is how you would convert that JavaScript code into Golang:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    // Create a string variable equal to any text value.
    var s1 = "Hello"

    // Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way.
    s1 += ", World!"'

    // Show the contents of the variable after the append operation.
    fmt.Println(s1)
}
```
The Go code does exactly what your JavaScript code does: It declares a string, appends another string to it and then prints out the final string value.
