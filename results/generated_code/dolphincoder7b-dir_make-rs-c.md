### Pseudocode:

CREATE-DIR-WITH-CREATION(path)
    IF NOT EXISTS(path)
        create(path)
    END IF
END FUNCTION


### Code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

bool mkdir_with_creation(const char *path) {
    if (access(path, F_OK) == -1) {
        return mkdir(path, 0777);
    } else {
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. The `mkdir_with_creation` function takes a path as its argument and returns a boolean indicating success or failure of the operation.
2. Firstly, it checks if the directory at the given path already exists by calling the `access` function with `F_OK` flag set (which means check for file existence). If the directory doesn't exist, it creates the directory and returns `true`. Otherwise, it simply returns `true`, as the directory is already there.
3. The `mkdir` function is used to create a new directory at the given path. It takes two arguments: the path of the directory to be created and permissions for that directory. In this example, I set the permissions to 0777 which gives read, write, execute permissions to all users (which is the default behavior).
4. The `access` function checks if a file exists at the given path. If the file doesn't exist, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns 0. Hence the comparison in the first line of code does not always return true when the directory exists. This can be corrected by using the `stat` function instead (which is platform-independent).
5. The `stat` function takes a path as its argument and stores information about the file at that path in a structure. This allows us to use it for checking if the path refers to an existing directory or not, without relying on the system call's result.
6. If the file exists and is a directory (according to `stat`), the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
7. The `mkdir_with_creation` function can be used in any C program that needs to create directories with creation. It checks if the path already exists by calling the `access` or `stat` functions and then creates a new directory if necessary. This function works cross-platform as it uses standard POSIX functions that are available on all operating systems.
