 Unfortunately, the C standard library does not provide a function for renaming directories or files in the same way that std::rename does with files. You can use std::rename to rename individual files but you cannot use it to rename directories. For renaming directories in C, you must utilize system-dependent functions such as `rename()`, `link()` and others. Here is how to do this on a POSIX compliant operating system (like Linux or macOS):

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>  // for rename()

int main(){
    if(rename("input.txt", "output.txt") != 0 ||
       rename("docs", "mydocs") != 0 ||
       rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt") != 0 ||
       rename("/docs", "/mydocs") != 0){
        perror("rename"); // If there was an error, this will print it to stderr
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Note: The `rename` function in Unix/POSIX systems is different from the one in C++. In C++, it's used for renaming files or directories within a program, while in POSIX systems, you use `rename()` system call which changes the name of a file to another (without the need of a running program), and it can only be done by the owner of the directory/file.
The "/" prefix before filenames is used to specify an absolute path instead of a relative one.

Finally, please ensure that your C code runs with root privileges because renaming directories require this privilege.
