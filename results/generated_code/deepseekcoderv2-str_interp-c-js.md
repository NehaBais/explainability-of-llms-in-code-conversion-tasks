 Certainly! Below is the JavaScript code that performs string interpolation similar to the given C code:

```javascript
let extra = "big";
console.log(`Mary had a ${extra} lamb.`);
```

In this JavaScript code, we use template literals (backticks) for string interpolation, where `${variableName}` is used to embed the value of `extra` into the string.
