Here's the Python code that verifies the size of a file called input.txt for a file in the current working directory and another one in the file system root:
```python
import os
def print_file_size(filename):
    try:
        size = os.path.getsize(filename)
        print(f"Size of file {filename} is {size} bytes.")
    except OSError as e:
        print(e)
print_file_size("input.txt")
print_file_size("/input.txt")
```
Note that the `os` module in Python provides a function called `getsize()` that can be used to get the size of a file, similar to the `file_size()` function in C++. However, you need to provide the full path of the file to the `getsize()` function.
