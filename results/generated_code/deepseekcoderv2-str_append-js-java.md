 Here's how you can convert the given JavaScript code to Java:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "Hello";
        s1 += ", World!";
        System.out.println(s1);
    }
}
```

In this code, `s1` is initialized with the string "Hello". Then, the `+=` operator is used to append ", World!" to `s1`. Finally, the contents of `s1` are printed using `System.out.println()`.
