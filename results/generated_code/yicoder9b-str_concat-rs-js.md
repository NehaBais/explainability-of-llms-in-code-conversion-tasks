Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your Rust program:

```JavaScript
let s = "hello";
console.log(s);

let s1 = s + " world";
console.log(s1);
```
In this JavaScript version, the variables `s` and `s1` are created with the `let` keyword instead of `var`. The `console.log()` function is equivalent to `println!()` in Rust for printing text to the console. The concatenation operator "+" works exactly as it does in Rust for combining strings into one string.
