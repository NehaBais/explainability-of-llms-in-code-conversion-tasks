Here is the Python equivalent of your Java code:

```python
# Create a string variable equal to any text value.
string = "abc"
print(string)

# Append the string variable with another string literal in the most idiomatic way.
string += "def"
print(string)
```

This Python code does exactly what your Java code did: it first creates a string, then prints its contents, appends another string to it and prints its new contents.
