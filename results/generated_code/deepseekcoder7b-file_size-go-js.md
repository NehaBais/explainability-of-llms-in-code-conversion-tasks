In JavaScript, you can use the `fs` module from Node.js to achieve similar functionality. Here is an equivalent code in JavaScript -

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function printFileSize(f) {
    fs.stat(f, (err, stat) => {
        if (err) { 
            console.log(err); 
        } else {
            console.log(stat.size);
        }
    });
}

printFileSize("input.txt");
printFileSize("/input.txt");
```

Please note that in JavaScript, file paths beginning with "/" refer to the root of the filesystem (similar to how a URL with a scheme like "file:///" refers to the root directory on many systems). In other words, using absolute path as in your Go example wouldn't work because Node.js doesnâ€™t use the same concept for directories, it uses a different concept called `/` based paths from the current working directory of your program.
