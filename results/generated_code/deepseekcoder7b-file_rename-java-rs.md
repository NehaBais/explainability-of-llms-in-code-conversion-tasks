Here is the equivalent Rust code for your Java program. However, be aware that in Rust you cannot use `rename()` on files and directories directly with standard library functions. You have to make use of lower level system calls (like std::fs). This example also assumes there are no symbolic links in the way:
```rust
use std::fs;
use std::env;
use std::io::Error;

fn rename_file(old_path: &str, new_path: &str) -> Result<(), Error>  {
    fs::rename(old_path, new_path)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn test(type_: &str, old_name: &str, new_name: &str)  {
    match rename_file(old_name, new_name) {
        Ok(_) => println!("The following {} called {} was renamed as {}.",
                           type_, old_name, new_name),
        Err(e) => println!("{} could not be renamed into {} because of: {}", 
                            old_name, new_name, e),
    };
}

fn main() {
    let current_dir = env::current_dir().unwrap();
    let root_path = "/"; // on Unix-based systems. Change it accordingly for other platforms
    
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt");
    test("file", format!("{}/input.txt", current_dir), "output.txt");
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs");
    test("directory", format!("{}/docs", root_path), "mydocs"); 
}
```
Please replace "/" with the correct path to your filesystem's root on non-Unix platforms (like "C:\\"). The function `env::current_dir().unwrap()` returns current directory in Rust. It will print an error message if any issues occur. Also, be aware that it can panic if there is no current directory.
