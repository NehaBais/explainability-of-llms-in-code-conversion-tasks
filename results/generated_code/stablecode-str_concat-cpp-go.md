Here is the equivalent code in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
    s := "hello"
    fmt.Println(s, "literal"))

    s2 := s + " literal"
    fmt.Println(s2))
}
```
In the Go code, we don't need to import any libraries as we use standard library functions in Go. 

Additionally, Go does not require explicit type declaration like `std::string` or `std::cout`. Instead, Go uses a more flexible and modern approach where it uses types to carry meaning rather than classes in C++ which are not first-class citizens in Go.

Therefore, the conversion from the given C++ code to Go is straightforward as we don't need any libraries to print on console in Go. We just have to use builtin functions such as `Println`.
