Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your C code:

```javascript
let str = "Good Morning";
let cstr = " to all";
let cstr2 = " !!";

// Append str variable with another string literal in JavaScript.
str += cstr;
str += cstr2;

console.log(str);
```
In the above code, we have created a string variable 'str' and appended it with other string literals 'cstr', 'cstr2'. The result is logged to the console.
