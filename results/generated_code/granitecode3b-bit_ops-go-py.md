Sure! Here's the Python code that performs the same operations as the Golang code:
```python
package main
import fmt
def bitwise(a, b):
 print(f"a:   {bin(a)}")
 print(f"b:   {bin(b)}")

 # Bitwise logical operations
 print(f"and: {bin(a & b)}")
 print(f"or:  {bin(a | b)}")
 print(f"xor: {bin(a ^ b)}")
 print(f"not: {bin(~a)}")

 if b < 0:
 print("Right operand is negative, but all shifts require an unsigned right operand (shift distance).")
 return

 # Logical shifts (unsigned left operand)
 print(f"shl: {bin(a << b)}")
 print(f"shr: {bin(a >> b)}")

 # Arithmetic shifts (signed left operand)
 print(f"las: {bin(a << b)}")
 print(f"ras: {bin(a >> b)}")

 # Rotations
 print(f"rol: {bin(a << b | a >> (16 - b))}")
 print(f"ror: {bin(a >> b | a << (16 - b))}")
if __name__ == '__main__':
 a, b = -460, 6
 bitwise(a, b)
```
The Python code uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert integers to binary strings and the logical operators `&`, `|`, and `^` for bitwise AND, OR, and XOR respectively. The `~` operator is used to perform a bitwise NOT on the first integer. 
The shifts and rotates are performed using the `<<` and `>>` operators for left and right shifts respectively, and the `|` and `&` operators for logical shifts and rotations respectively. The amount of shift/rotate is obtained by converting the second integer to an unsigned int using `uint32(b)`.
