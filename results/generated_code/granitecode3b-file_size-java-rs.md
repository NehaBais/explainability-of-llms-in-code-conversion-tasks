Here's the Rust code that performs the same task as the given Java code:
```
use std::fs;
fn main() {
 let file_path = "input.txt";
 if let Ok(metadata) = fs::metadata(file_path) {
 let size = metadata.len();
 println!("File size: {} bytes", size);
 } else {
 eprintln!("Error: Unable to get file size for {}", file_path);
 }
 
 // Verify the same task with the root file system
 match fs::metadata("/") {
 Ok(metadata) => {
 let size = metadata.len();
 println!("Root file size: {} bytes", size);
 }
 Err(err) => eprintln!("Error: Unable to get root file size - {}", err),
 }
}
```
This Rust code uses the `fs` module from the standard library to read file information and obtain the length of a file. The code first defines a `file_path` variable that specifies the path to the input file, which is "input.txt" in this case. It then uses the `metadata()` function to obtain metadata about the file specified by `file_path`. If the metadata is successfully obtained, the length of the file is printed. Otherwise, an error message is printed.
The code also includes a verification task for the root file system ("/"). This task uses the same `metadata()` function but specifies the path to the root directory ("/") instead of the input file. If the metadata is successfully obtained, the length of the root file system is printed. Otherwise, an error message is printed.
