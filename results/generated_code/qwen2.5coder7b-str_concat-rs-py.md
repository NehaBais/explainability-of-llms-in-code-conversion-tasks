Here is your requested Python code:

```python
s = 'hello'
print(s)

s1 = s + ' world'
print(s1)
```

This Python code does the same thing as your Rust code. It creates a string variable `s` with value "hello", prints its content, then creates another string variable `s1` by concatenating `s` and another string literal (" world"), and finally prints the content of `s1`.
