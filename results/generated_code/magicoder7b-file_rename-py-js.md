 In JavaScript, you can use the `fs` module's `renameSync()` method to rename files or directories. However, in order to use this method with root-level paths (e.g., '/input.txt', '/docs'), you need appropriate permissions and may have to use an absolute path (`/home/user/input.txt`, `/home/user/docs`) depending on your system's configuration.

For a solution that works in both the current working directory and at root level, it is more complex as you will need to first navigate to the root level using `__dirname` or `process.cwd()`, then use relative paths for renaming.

Here is the JavaScript code:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// current directory
fs.renameSync("input.txt", "output.txt");  // Rename file in same dir.
fs.renameSync("docs", "mydocs");  // Rename folder in same dir.

// root level (change 'your-dir' to the actual name of your directory)
const cwd = process.cwd();
fs.renameSync(path.join(cwd, '/input.txt'), path.join(cwd, '/output.txt'));  // Rename file in the root level.
fs.renameSync(path.join(cwd, '/docs'), path.join(cwd, '/mydocs'));  // Rename folder in the root level.
```

Please note that there is no absolute way to get to the system's root level in JavaScript due to sandbox restrictions of node.js. This script will only work if you run it from your home directory or a directory where you have write access.
