Here is the JavaScript equivalent of your Rust code:

```javascript
var s = "hello";
console.log(s);

var s1 = s + " world";
console.log(s1);
```
In this Javascript code, we use the `+` operator to concatenate two strings. The `to_owned()` method is not required in JavaScript as it's a native string type which is immutable by default.
