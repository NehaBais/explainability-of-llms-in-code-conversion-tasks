Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for your Java function:

```JavaScript
function logic(A, B) {
    console.log("A AND B: " + (A && B));
    console.log("A OR B: " + (A || B));
    console.log("NOT A: " + (!A));
}
```

Please note that JavaScript uses camelCase for function names. It's a common convention in JavaScript to name functions with camelCase or PascalCase, which differs from Java where method names typically use lowercase with underscores separating words.
