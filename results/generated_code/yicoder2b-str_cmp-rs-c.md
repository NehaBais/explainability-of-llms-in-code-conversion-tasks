This is how the Rust code would look like after conversion to C: 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h> // for toupper function

int main() {
    const char *a = "abc";
    char b[4] = {'B', 'a', 'c', '\0'};  // equivalent to "Bac"
    
    if (strcmp(a, b) == 0) printf("The strings are equal\n");
    if (strcmp(a, b) != 0) printf("The strings are not equal\n");
    if (strcmp(a, b) > 0) printf("The first string is lexically after the second\n");  // equivalent to a > &b
    if (strcmp(a, b) < 0) printf("The first string is lexically before the second\n"); // equivalent to a < &b
    if (strcmp(a, b) >= 0) printf("The first string is not lexically before the second\n");  // equivalent to a <= &b
    if (strcmp(a, b) <= 0) printf("The first string is not lexically after the second\n"); // equivalent to a >= &b

    // Case-insensitive comparison
    char a2[4] = {'A', 'B', 'c', '\0'};  // equivalent to "ABC"
    char b2[3] = {'b', 'a', 'C', '\0'};  // equivalent to "bac"
    if (strcasecmp(a2, b2) == 0) printf("Both strings are equal when ignoring case\n");  // equivalent to a.eq_ignore_ascii_case(&b2)

    return 0;
}
```
Please note that C does not provide as direct comparison of strings as Rust does with the == and != operators, because it treats all strings internally as arrays of bytes which can be compared directly. This is why we need to convert our strings to ASCII uppercase when doing case insensitive comparisons in C.
