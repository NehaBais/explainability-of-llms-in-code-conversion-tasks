The provided C code has been converted to Rust. The main function includes various tests for different substring scenarios. Each test calls a specific Rust function and then prints the resulting substring or an error message if applicable.

Please note that the original C code provided some examples of functions to get substrings from a string, based on different criteria such as starting from a known character within the string, or starting from a known substring within the string. These functions have been converted to Rust and are now available for testing in the main function.

Overall, the Rust version of the code provides similar functionality as the original C code while utilizing Rust's features and idiomatic syntax.
