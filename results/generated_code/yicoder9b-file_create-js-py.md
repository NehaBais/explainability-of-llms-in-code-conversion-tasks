In Python the os and pathlib libraries can be used to accomplish this task:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

def create_empty_file_and_directory(path):
    # Create an empty file
    with open(os.path.join(path, "output.txt"), 'w') as f: 
        pass

    # Create an empty directory
    try:
        os.mkdir(os.path.join(path, "docs"))
    except OSError as error:
        print(error)

# Run twice - once in the current working directory and once at the filesystem root
create_empty_file_and_directory('.') 
create_empty_file_and_directory('/')
```
This python code creates an empty file named "output.txt" and an empty directory called "docs", both files are created twice: once in the current working directory (represented as '.' in Python) and once at the filesystem root ('/'). If a directory with that name already exists it will not be replaced or deleted - instead os.mkdir function will raise OSError.
