In Python, you can use the `os` and `stat` libraries to achieve similar functionality as follows:

```python
import os
import stat

def get_file_size(filename):
    try:
        return os.path.getsize(filename)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File not found")
        return -1  # Return -1 to indicate file does not exist.

print(get_file_size('input.txt'))  
print(get_file_size('/input.txt'))
```

This code will print the size of `input.txt` in the current directory and then the root directory if it exists, otherwise it will return -1 to indicate that the file does not exist. Please replace 'input.txt' with your filename if you need to check different files. 

Note: It is important for you to know that Python requires explicit error handling like FileNotFoundError when trying to find the size of a non-existent file, unlike C where it returns -1 and errno set which can be checked later by perror or equivalent function from your platform/library (like python's ctypes).
