Answer: The code you provided is written in Python and the first line specifies that it should be run using a python version 2.x interpreter with the future module activated (from __future__ import with_statement). This means that the code will work correctly only on those versions of Python older than Python 3 where the with statement was introduced.

The second part is about how to translate this into C++. It uses some python-specific keywords such as "with" and "pass". To convert it into a c++ program we can use templates (which are not available in most programming languages) but they would be very similar to the following code:
```
#include <iostream> // standard input output library from C++11 onwards, or iostream.h if using older version of GCC 4.* and above
using namespace std; // same as python import * but for namespaces in c++ you have to put the whole line here instead of just a single statement (it will work without this because most compilers automatically add it), also note that there is no semicolon after the word "namespace" unlike with variables which are terminated by semi-colons at end - so if your code had something like "return 0;" then you would need to use braces around all statements inside main() otherwise they won't compile properly!
int main(){ // start of main function definition block where everything else takes place in C++ programs; note that there are no semicolons at end because unlike with variables which have their own separate declaration statement for each line (and thus require semicolons) here we only need one semicolon per line so it won't cause any problems when compiling
return 0; // return value of function (can also be done without braces but if you want to make sure that everything works correctly then use braces around the whole thing including its body code).
```
