Here is the converted code from Java to Rust that verifies if the files "input.txt" and "docs" exist in the current working directory and a file and a directory in the filesystem root respectively:
```
use std::fs;
fn main() {
 // Verifying the existence of "input.txt" and "docs" in the current working directory
 let file_exists = fs::metadata("docs/input.txt").is_ok();
 println!("File exists in the current working directory: {}", file_exists);
 // Verifying the existence of "input.txt" and "docs" in the filesystem root
 let file_exists = fs::metadata("/docs/input.txt").is_ok();
 println!("File exists in the filesystem root: {}", file_exists);
}
```
In this code, we use the `std::fs` module to check if the files exist by using the `metadata` function which returns a `Result`. If the metadata for the file or directory can be retrieved successfully, it means that the file or directory exists. We then print whether the file exists in the current working directory and in the filesystem root.
