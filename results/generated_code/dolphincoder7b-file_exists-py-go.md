This is a very basic Python script that checks whether the specified file or directory exists in the current working directory and root filesystem. It doesn't check whether they exist in your Go application's source code or if the files are accessible for reading. This is more of a theoretical exercise, as most people wouldn't want to actually run this script in their own environment.

In Golang, there are built-in functions to perform these checks: os.Stat and os.IsNotExist. Here is how you might use them:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func checkFile(filename string) {
    info, err := os.Stat(filename)
    if os.IsNotExist(err) {
        fmt.Printf("%s does not exist\n", filename)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("File %s exists!\n", filename)
    }
}

func checkDirectory(dir string) {
    info, err := os.Stat(dir)
    if os.IsNotExist(err) {
        fmt.Printf("%s does not exist\n", dir)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("Directory %s exists!\n", dir)
    }
}

func main() {
    checkFile("input.txt")
    checkFile("/input.txt")
    checkDirectory("docs")
    checkDirectory("/docs")
}
```

Please note that it's not possible to perform these checks in the current working directory and root filesystem with these functions because Go doesn't have access to the filesystem of your machine as a whole, but only to the files or directories within your code.
