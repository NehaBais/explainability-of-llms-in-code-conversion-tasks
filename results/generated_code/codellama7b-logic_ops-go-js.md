Sure! Here's the equivalent code in JavaScript:
```
function printLogic(a, b) {
  console.log(`a and b is ${a && b}`);
  console.log(`a or b is ${a || b}`);
  console.log(`not a is ${!a}`);
}
```
Note that in JavaScript, the logical operators `&&` and `||` are used for "and" and "or" respectively, while the unary operator `!` is used for "not". Also, `console.log()` is used instead of `fmt.Println()` to print the output to the console.
