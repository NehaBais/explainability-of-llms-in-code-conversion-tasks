 Rust doesn't have built-in functions for renaming files/directories like C++ does, so we need to use standard library methods like `std::fs::rename` and `std::env::temp_dir`. Here is the equivalent Rust code:
```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn rename_and_copy() {
    let input = "input.txt";
    let output = "output.txt";
    
    match fs::rename(input, output) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Renamed file from {} to {}", input, output),
        Err(err) => eprintln!("Error: {}", err),
    }

    let docs = "docs";
    let mydocs = "mydocs";
    
    match fs::rename(Path::new(&*docs), Path::new(&*mydocs)) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Renamed directory from {} to {}", docs, mydocs),
        Err(err) => eprintln!("Error: {}", err),
    }
    
    let root_input = "/input.txt";
    let root_output = "/output.txt";
    
    match fs::rename(&root_input, &root_output) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Renamed file from {} to {} in the root", root_input, root_output),
        Err(err) => eprintln!("Error: {}", err),
    }
    
    let root_docs = "/docs";
    let root_mydocs = "/mydocs";
    
    match fs::rename(&Path::new(&*root_docs), &Path::new(&*root_mydocs)) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Renamed directory from {} to {} in the root", root_docs, root_mydocs),
        Err(err) => eprintln!("Error: {}", err),
    }
}

fn main() {
    rename_and_copy();
}
```
Please note that Rust does not allow relative paths to be moved/renamed to absolute paths. As a result, in order to move files or directories from the root of the filesystem, you need to provide an absolute path including the root prefix ("/" on Unix-like systems), like "/input.txt" and "/docs".
Also note that the current directory is not included in the list of "here", so it doesn't have an effect if we rename a file/directory called "output.txt" or "mydocs" in the "here" scope, because they don't exist there.
