Here's the Golang code that meets your requirements:
```go
func logic(a, b bool) {
 fmt.Println("a AND b:", a && b)
 fmt.Println("a OR b:", a || b)
 fmt.Println("NOT a:", !a)
}
```
Note that I've used the `&&`, `||`, and `!` operators for logical AND, OR, and NOT respectively, as well as `fmt.Println()` to print to the console. Also, I've made the function parameters `a` and `b` of type `bool` to match the Java code.
