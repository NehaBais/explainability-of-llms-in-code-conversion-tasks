Sure, here is the equivalent Python code for the given C++ code snippet.

```python
# defining the original string and character to be replaced
original = "Mary had a X lamb."
toBeReplaced = "X" 
replacement = "little"  

# replacing 'X' with 'little' in the original string
newString = original.replace( toBeReplaced, replacement )
print ("String after replacement: " + newString)
```
This code will replace all occurrences of 'X' with 'little' in the given original string and print it out.
