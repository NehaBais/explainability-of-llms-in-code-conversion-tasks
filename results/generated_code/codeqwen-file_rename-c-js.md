In JavaScript, you can use the `fs.renameSync()` method to rename files and directories:

Here is how the code should look like:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Rename file in current working directory
try {
    fs.renameSync('./input.txt', './output.txt');
    console.log(`File renamed successfully to output.txt`);
} catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error occurred while renaming the file: ${err}`);
}

// Rename directory in current working directory
try {
    fs.renameSync('./docs', './mydocs');
    console.log(`Directory renamed successfully to mydocs`);
} catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error occurred while renaming the directory: ${err}`);
}

// Rename file in root of filesystem
try {
    fs.renameSync('/input.txt', '/output.txt');
    console.log(`File renamed successfully to /output.txt`);
} catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error occurred while renaming the file: ${err}`);
}

// Rename directory in root of filesystem
try {
    fs.renameSync('/docs', '/mydocs');
    console.log(`Directory renamed successfully to /mydocs`);
} catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error occurred while renaming the directory: ${err}`);
}
```

Please note that if you are trying to rename a file/directory in root, it requires admin privileges as file/directory cannot be renamed in the root directory unless it is an administrator or has appropriate permissions.
