 In Rust, you can use the `std::fs::File` and `std::fs::Dir` types to create a file or a directory respectively. For creating an empty file, we need to open it in write mode and then close it immediately. As for creating an empty directory, it's a straightforward call to `create_dir`.

Here is the corresponding Rust code:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn create(directory: &str) {
    let _file = fs::File::create(format!("{}/output.txt", directory));
    fs::create_dir_all(format!("{}/docs", directory)).unwrap();
}

fn main() {
    create("."); // current directory
    create("/"); // root directory
}
```

The `main` function calls the `create` function for both the "current" (".") and the "root" ("/") directories. The use of `unwrap()` is only for simplicity in this example, in a real application you should handle the error correctly.
