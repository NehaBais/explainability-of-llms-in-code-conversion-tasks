To convert the given Java code to Python, you can use the following implementation:
```
import os

def create_file(path):
    try:
        with open(path, "w") as f:
            pass  # Create a new file
    except OSError as e:
        print(e)

def create_dir(path):
    try:
        os.mkdir(path)
    except OSError as e:
        print(e)

# Create an empty file called "output.txt" in the current working directory and in the filesystem root
create_file("output.txt")
create_file(os.sep + "output.txt")

# Create an empty directory called "docs" in the current working directory and in the filesystem root
create_dir("docs")
create_dir(os.sep + "docs")
```
Explanation:

1. The `import` statement is used to import the `os` module, which provides functions for interacting with the file system.
2. The `create_file()` function creates a new file in the specified path. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.
3. The `create_dir()` function creates a new directory in the specified path. If the directory already exists, it will not be overwritten.
4. In the `main` method, we call the `create_file()` and `create_dir()` functions twice each to create an empty file called "output.txt" and an empty directory called "docs" in both the current working directory and in the filesystem root.
5. We use `os.sep + "output.txt"` and `os.sep + "docs"` to specify the path for the new files and directories, which are created in the root of the file system.
6. We catch any `OSError` exceptions that may occur during file creation or directory creation, and print a message to the user explaining what went wrong.
7. The program will create two empty files called "output.txt" in the current working directory and in the filesystem root, and two empty directories called "docs" in the current working directory and in the filesystem root.
