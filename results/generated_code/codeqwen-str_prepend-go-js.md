Here's how you can convert this Golang code into JavaScript:

```javascript
let s = "world!";
s = "Hello, " + s;
```

In the above JavaScript code, we are creating a string variable `s` and assigning it with the value `"world!"`. Then we are concatenating the string `"Hello, "` to the existing value of `s`, resulting in a new string `"Hello, world!"`.
