Here's the equivalent Rust code for your Java program:

```rust
fn main() {
    compare("Hello", "Hello");
    compare("5", "5.0");
    compare("java", "Java");
    compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĴÃVÁ");
    compare("ĴÃVÁ", "ĵãvá");
}

fn compare(a: &str, b: &str) {
    if a == b {
        println!("'{}' and '{}' are lexically equal.", a, b);
    } else {
        println!("'{}' and '{}' are not lexically equal.", a, b);
    }

    let case_insensitive = a.to_lowercase() == b.to_lowercase();
    if case_insensitive {
        println!("'{}' and '{}' are case-insensitive lexically equal.", a, b);
    } else {
        println!("'{}' and '{}' are not case-insensitive lexically equal.", a, b);
    }

    let result = a.cmp(b);
    match result {
        std::cmp::Ordering::Less => println!("'{}' is lexically before '{}'.", a, b),
        std::cmp::Ordering::Equal => println!("'{}' and '{}' are lexically equal.", a, b),
        std::cmp::Ordering::Greater => println!("'{}' is lexically after '{}'.", a, b),
    }

    let case_insensitive_result = a.to_lowercase().cmp(b.to_lowercase());
    match case_insensitive_result {
        std::cmp::Ordering::Less => println!("'{}' is case-insensitively before '{}'.", a, b),
        std::cmp::Ordering::Equal => println!("'{}' and '{}' are case-insensitively equal.", a, b),
        std::cmp::Ordering::Greater => println!("'{}' is case-insensitively after '{}'.", a, b),
    }

    let lex_relationship = format!("{}", result);
    println!("The lexical relationship is: {}", lex_relationship);

    let ci_lex_relationship = format!("{}", case_insensitive_result);
    println!("The case-insensitive lexical relationship is: {}", ci_lex_relationship);
}
```

In this Rust code:

- `a == b` compares two strings for exact equality.
- `a.to_lowercase() == b.to_lowercase()` checks if the two strings are equal when both are converted to lowercase, which achieves a case insensitive comparison.
- The `cmp` method is used to get an Ordering enum (`Less`, `Equal`, or `Greater`) representing the lexical order of the two strings. This result is then matched against these values using Rust's `match` statement to print whether one string is before or after another.
- Both `a.cmp(b)` and `a.to_lowercase().cmp(b.to_lowercase())` are used to compare the lexical relationship, with case sensitive and case insensitive comparisons respectively.

Note that numeric strings are compared lexicographically in both Java and Rust. If you want them to be treated numerically instead of lexically, you'd need to parse the strings into numbers before comparing them.
