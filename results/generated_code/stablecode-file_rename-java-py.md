Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
import os
import shutil

def rename_file(oldname, newname):
    # File (or directory) with old name
    oldpath = os.path.abspath(oldname))
    if not os.path.exists(oldpath)):
        print('Error: the file {} does not exist.'.format(oldname)))
        return False

    # File (or directory) with new name
    newpath = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), '..', newname))
    if os.path.exists(newpath)):
        print('Error: the file {} already exists.'.format(newname)))
        return False

    # Rename file (or directory)
    try:
        shutil.move(oldpath, newpath)
        success = True
    except Exception as e:
        print('An error occurred while renaming the file {} to {}.'.format(oldname, newname)))
        print(str(e)))
        success = False

    return success


def test(type, oldname, newname):
    print("The following {} called {} was renamed as {}.".format(type, oldname, newname) if rename_file(oldname, newname)) else print('Error: the file {} could not be renamed into {}.'.format(oldname, newname)))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test("file", "input.txt", "output.txt"))
    test("directory", "docs", "mydocs"))
```
This Python script replicates the functionality of the given Java code. It takes in three arguments: the type of entity to be renamed (either a file or directory), the old name, and the new name. The `rename_file` function checks if the old file exists and if the new file does not exist already. If these conditions are met, the function renames the file using the `shutil.move` method. If an error occurs during the renaming process, the function catches the exception and prints an error message. The `test` function tests the `rename_file` function by passing in various sets of arguments. The script then prints a success message if the renaming was successful or an error message if there was an issue with the renaming process.
