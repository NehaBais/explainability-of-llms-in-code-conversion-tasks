In C, you can use the `fopen` function to create an empty file and the `mkdir` function to create a new directory. Here's an example of how you could modify the given code to achieve this:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int main() {
    // Create a new empty file called "output.txt" in the current working directory
    FILE *f = fopen("output.txt", "w");
    if (f == NULL) {
        perror("Error creating output.txt file");
        return 1;
    }
    fclose(f);

    // Create a new empty file called "/output.txt" in the root directory
    FILE *g = fopen("/output.txt", "w");
    if (g == NULL) {
        perror("Error creating /output.txt file");
        return 1;
    }
    fclose(g);

    // Create a new directory called "docs" in the current working directory
    mkdir("docs", 0755);

    // Create a new directory called "/docs" in the root directory
    mkdir("/docs", 0755);

    return 0;
}
```
Note that the `mkdir` function requires the mode parameter, which specifies the permissions for the newly created directory. In this example, we're using 0755 as the mode, which means the directory will be created with read and execute permission for the owner, read and write permission for the group, and read and execute permission for others.

Also note that `fopen` returns a `FILE *` pointer to the file stream, and we're using the `fclose` function to close the file stream after we're done with it. This is necessary because `fopen` does not create the file if it doesn't exist, and it will fail if the file already exists and cannot be opened for writing.
