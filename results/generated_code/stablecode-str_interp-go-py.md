Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
def main(): 
    str = "Mary had a %s lamb"
    txt = "little"
    out = str % txt
    print(out)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This Python script does the same thing as the given GoLang script. It uses string formatting to replace `%s` in the original string with the value of variable `txt`.
