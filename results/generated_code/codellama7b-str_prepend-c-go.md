To convert the code from C to Go, we can use the following syntax:
```
package main
import "fmt"
import "unsafe"
func main() {
	str := []byte("my String")
	cstr := []byte("Changed ")
	dup := unsafe.Slice(str)
	sprintf(str, "%s%s", cstr, dup)
	free(dup)
	fmt.Println(string(str))
}
```
Note: In Go, we use the `[]byte` type to represent strings, and the `unsafe` package is used to convert between slices and pointers.
Also, since Go doesn't have a `free` function, we can simply remove it from the code.
