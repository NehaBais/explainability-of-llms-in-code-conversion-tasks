Rust doesn't have a direct equivalent of Java's File class, but we can use the `std::fs` module in Rust to achieve similar results. Here is how you could translate your code into Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io::Error;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    match fs::File::create("output.txt") {
        Ok(_) => println!("Created file 'output.txt' in the current directory"),
        Err(error) => println!("Failed to create file 'output.txt' in the current directory: {}", error),
    };
    
    match fs::File::create("/output.txt") {
        Ok(_) => println!("Created file '/output.txt' in the root directory"),
        Err(error) => println!("Failed to create file '/output.txt' in the root directory: {}", error),
    };
    
    match fs::DirBuilder::new().recursive(true).create("/docs") {
        Ok(_) => println!("Created directory 'docs' in the root directory"),
        Err(error) => println!("Failed to create directory 'docs' in the root directory: {}", error),
    };
    
    match fs::DirBuilder::new().recursive(true).create("docs") {
        Ok(_) => println!("Created directory 'docs' in the current directory"),
        Err(error) => println!("Failed to create directory 'docs' in the current directory: {}", error),
    };
}
```
This Rust code will attempt to create two files, "output.txt" and "/output.txt" (the latter being a full path starting from root), as well as two directories, "docs" and "/docs". If any of these operations fail, the errors will be printed to the console by the program.
