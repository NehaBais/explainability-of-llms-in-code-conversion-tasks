The provided Golang code creates a new file and directory with the given names in the current working directory and filesystem root respectively. 
However, please note that Python has different ways to handle these tasks as it does not have an equivalent to Go's os package. Instead, Python uses functions like open() for handling files and os.makedirs() or os.mkdir() for making directories. Here is how the same code can be translated to Python:
```python
import os

def create_file(fn):
    with open(fn, 'w') as f: pass
    print('file', fn, 'created!')

def create_dir(dn):
    os.makedirs(dn, exist_ok=True) 
    print('directory', dn, 'created!')

# call the functions with the desired names 
create_file("input.txt")
create_file('/input.txt')
create_dir("docs")
create_dir('/docs')
```
You can change '/' to '' for root directory. This Python version will create both a new file and a directory with the given names in the current working directory or filesystem root respectively.
