Here's the Python code that meets the requirements:
```python
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))
print("sum:", a + b)
print("difference:", a - b)
print("product:", a * b)
print("integer quotient:", a // b) # rounds towards zero
print("remainder:", a % b) # same sign as first operand
```
In Python, the `//` operator is used for integer division, which rounds towards zero. The `%` operator returns the remainder of the division of two integers, with the same sign as the first operand.
