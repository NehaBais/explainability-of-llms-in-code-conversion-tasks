 Here's the Python code that should accomplish the same task:

```
import sys

# get two integers from the user
nbr1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
nbr2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))

# check if the first integer is less than, equal to, or greater than the second integer
if nbr1 < nbr2:
    print(f"{nbr1} is less than {nbr2}")
elif nbr1 == nbr2:
    print(f"{nbr1} is equal to {nbr2}")
else:
    print(f"{nbr1} is greater than {nbr2}")
```
