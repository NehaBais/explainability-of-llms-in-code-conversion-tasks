The equivalent C++ code for the given Java code is as follows: 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream> // required for stringstream
using namespace std;
int main() {
    string str = "abc";
    cout << str << endl;
    str += "def";
    cout << str << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This code does exactly the same as the given Java code. It declares a string variable, prints its initial value, appends another string to it and then prints the updated string.
