In C, the `rename()` function works similarly to C++. It renames a file or directory within the same filesystem volume. If you want to move a file or directory between directories in C, you'll need to use system calls like `mkdir()`, `rmdir()`, `chdir()`, and `execl()` (or one of its variants) or the POSIX functions `renameat2()` and `fchmodat()`. 

However, it's important to note that `std::rename()` in C++ is not required for moving files between directories. It can only rename a file within the same directory. For moving from one place to another, you need to use `mkdir()`, `rmdir()`, `chdir()`, and `execl()` (or one of its variants).

Here's an example of how it works in C:
```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    if(mkdir("/mydocs", 0755) == -1){
        perror("Error creating directory");
        return 1;
    }

    if(rename("input.txt", "/mydocs/output.txt") == -1){
        perror("Error moving file");
        return 1;
    }

    rmdir("/docs");

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a new directory `/mydocs`, then moves the file `input.txt` to `/mydocs/output.txt`. Afterwards, it removes the original directory `docs`.

Remember that these functions will not work if you don't have appropriate permissions.
