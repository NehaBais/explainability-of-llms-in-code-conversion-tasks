Here's the equivalent Python code:
```python
from strings import StringBuilder
s = StringBuilder()
s += "foo"
s += "bar"
print(s)
```
This code creates a `StringBuilder` object and appends two string literals to it using the `+=` operator. Finally, it prints the contents of the `StringBuilder` object using the `.string()` method.
