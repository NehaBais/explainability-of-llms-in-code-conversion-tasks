In Python, you can use f-strings to perform this type of interpolation. Here's how you would modify your Java code to perform the same task in Python:

```python
adjective = "little"
lyric = f"Mary had a {adjective} lamb"
```

In this Python code, `f-strings` are used for formatting strings. The `{}` brackets are replaced with variable values inside the string. This is equivalent to String.format in Java.
