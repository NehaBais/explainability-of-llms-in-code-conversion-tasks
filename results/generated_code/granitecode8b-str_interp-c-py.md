Here's the Python code that performs string interpolation using the `format()` method:
```python
extra = "little"
print("Mary had a {} lamb.".format(extra))
```
The output of this code will be:

Mary had a little lamb.

In the Python code, we first define the variable `extra` and assign it the value `"little"`. Then, we use the `format()` method on the string `"Mary had a {} lamb."`, where `{}` is a placeholder for the value of `extra`. The `format()` method replaces the placeholder with the value of `extra`, resulting in the final output.
