```python
from ctypes import *
import string
import re
def main():
    str = create_string_buffer(b'my String')
    cstr = create_string_buffer(b'Changed ')
    dup = create_string_buffer()
    sprintf(str, "%s%s", cstr, (dup.value = str.value))
    free(dup)
    print(str.value.decode())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
In Python, you don't have to include the `stdlib.h` and `string.h` headers because these are already included in the standard library. Also, the C `sprintf` function does not exist in Python; instead, we use the `ctypes` module in Python which provides a way to interface with C code from within Python.

Please note that this is just a basic implementation of the Python code and might need some modifications or enhancements based on the actual requirements. Also, using `ctypes` can create issues if you are working with pointers or memory management directly in C which isn't recommended for Python due to its garbage collection model. Always ensure that the necessary dependencies are imported and you handle any potential errors appropriately.
