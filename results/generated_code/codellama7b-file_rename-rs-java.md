Sure! Here's the converted code in Java:
```scss
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        String err = "File move error";
        Files.move(new File("input.txt"), new File("output.txt"), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
        Files.move(new File("docs"), new File("mydocs"), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
        Files.move(new File("/input.txt"), new File("/output.txt"), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
        Files.move(new File("/docs"), new File("/mydocs"), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
    }
}
```
Note that the `Files.move` method is used to rename a file or directory, and the `StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING` option is used to replace any existing files with the same name during the move operation.

Also note that in Java, we use the `File` class to represent files and directories, and the `Files` class provides methods for working with files and directories.

In the first two lines of code, we rename the file "input.txt" to "output.txt" by calling the `move` method on the `Files` object, passing in the original file path and the new file path as arguments. We also use the `REPLACE_EXISTING` option to replace any existing files with the same name during the move operation.

In the next two lines of code, we rename the directory "docs" to "mydocs" by calling the `move` method on the `Files` object, passing in the original directory path and the new directory path as arguments. We also use the `REPLACE_EXISTING` option to replace any existing files with the same name during the move operation.

Finally, we repeat the same process for the file "input.txt" located at the root of the filesystem by calling the `move` method on the `Files` object, passing in the original file path and the new file path as arguments. We also use the `REPLACE_EXISTING` option to replace any existing files with the same name during the move operation.

Again, we repeat the same process for the directory "docs" located at the root of the filesystem by calling the `move` method on the `Files` object, passing in the original directory path and the new directory path as arguments. We also use the `REPLACE_EXISTING` option to replace any existing files with the same name during the move operation.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
