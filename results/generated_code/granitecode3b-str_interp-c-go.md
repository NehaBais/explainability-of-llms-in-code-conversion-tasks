Here's the equivalent Golang code:
```
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
 extra := "little"
 fmt.Printf("Mary had a %s lamb.", extra)
}
```
This code defines a variable `extra` and sets it to the value "little". It then uses string interpolation to print out the modified string using the `%s` format specifier, which will replace the "%s" placeholder with the value of the `extra` variable.
