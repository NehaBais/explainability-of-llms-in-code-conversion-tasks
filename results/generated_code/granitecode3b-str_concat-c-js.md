Sure! Here's the JavaScript code that performs the same task as the C code:
```javascript
const s = "hello";
const s2 = `${s} literal`;
console.log(s); // Output: hello
console.log(s2); // Output: hello literal
```
In this JavaScript code, we first declare a constant string variable `s` and assign it the value "hello". We then use template literals to create another string variable `s2`, which concatenates the value of `s` with the string "literal". Finally, we log both variables to the console.
