Here is how you can convert the given Golang code into Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Rename a file and directory here (in the current working directory)
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt").expect("Failed to rename 'input.txt' to 'output.txt'");
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs").expect("Failed to rename 'docs' to 'mydocs'");
    
    // Rename a file and directory in the filesystem root
    fs::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt").expect("Failed to rename '/input.txt' to '/output.txt'");
    fs::rename("/docs", "/mydocs").expect("Failed to rename '/docs' to '/mydocs'");
}
```

In Rust, we need to handle errors explicitly using the `Result` type and the `?` operator for convenience. The `fs::rename()` function is used similarly to the `os.Rename()` function in Golang.

Note: This program might not work as expected in a production environment because renaming files and directories at the filesystem root (`"/"`) requires administrative privileges, and it can be risky if handled improperly. Also, please ensure that the "input.txt", "docs", "/input.txt", and "/docs" exist before running this script.
