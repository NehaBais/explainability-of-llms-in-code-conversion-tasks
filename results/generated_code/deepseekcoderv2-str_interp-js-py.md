 Certainly! Here is the equivalent code in Python:

```python
original = "Mary had a X lamb"
little = "little"
replaced = original.replace("X", little)  # does not change the original string

print(replaced)  # Output will be "Mary had a little lamb"
```

In this Python code:
- `original` is defined as a string with "X" representing a placeholder for interpolation.
- `little` is defined as the value to replace "X" with.
- The `replace` method is used to substitute "X" with `little`, and the result is stored in `replaced`.
