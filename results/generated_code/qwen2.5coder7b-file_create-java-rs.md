In Rust, you can use the `std::fs` module to handle file and directory operations. Here is a translation of your Java code into Rust:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let paths = [
        Path::new("output.txt"),
        Path::new(&format!("{}/{}", std::env::consts::EXE_DIR, "output.txt")),
        Path::new("docs"),
        Path::new(&format!("{}/{}", std::env::consts::EXE_DIR, "docs")),
    ];

    for path in paths.iter() {
        if let Err(e) = fs::create_dir_all(path) {
            eprintln!("Failed to create directory or file: {}", e);
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that:

1. The `std::env::consts::EXE_DIR` constant returns the directory of the executable which is not strictly necessary in your case, but I used it because the original Java code uses `File.separator`. If you want to create files and directories in the root directory, just remove the part about `exe_dir`.

2. Rust's `fs::create_dir_all` function creates parent directories as needed (like `mkdir -p` in Unix/Linux).

3. The error handling is simplified compared to Java. In Rust, we use pattern matching with `if let Err(e) = ...` which allows us to handle errors directly where they occur without the need for a separate try-catch block.

4. To run this code, you need a Rust environment set up (like Rustup). You can compile and run it using `rustc filename.rs && ./filename`.
