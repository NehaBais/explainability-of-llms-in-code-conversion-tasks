In JavaScript, you can use the logical operators to achieve similar functionality as shown in the Python code. Here's an equivalent JavaScript function:
```
function logic(a, b) {
    console.log('a and b:', a && b);
    console.log('a or b:', a || b);
    console.log('not a:', !a);
}
```
You can call this function with your desired arguments to obtain the output as per your requirements.
