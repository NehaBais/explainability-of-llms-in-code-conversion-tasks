Here is the equivalent Rust code:
```rust
use std::os::rename;

fn main() {
    let _result = rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    let _result = rename("docs", "mydocs");

    // Assuming you have the permissions to access "/input.txt" and "/docs".
    let _result = rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    let _result = rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
}
```
Note: We cannot use the `rename` function directly because it is not available in Rust. Instead, we have to use the `std::os::rename` function from the standard library `std::os`. The reason for this is that `rename` is a macro provided by C which does not exist in Rust. Also note that the error handling and actual functionality of renaming files in Rust are somewhat different than they are in C, so it might require some changes in terms of how you handle the rename operation's result. Also, please make sure to replace `input.txt` and `output.txt` with valid file names or paths on your system where you want to rename a file. Similarly, replace `/input.txt` and `/docs` with valid file names or paths in the root directory of your filesystem.
