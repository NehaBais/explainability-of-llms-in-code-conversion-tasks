Here is the equivalent C code for your requirement. Note that, in cstdio library, rename function accepts two parameters as char const * instead of wchar_t const * on Windows platform and this might cause issues when running on different platforms due to type-safety rules so be sure about the OS you are using.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    rename("docs", "mydocs");
    //rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");  /* You cannot change the root directory */
    //rename("/docs", "/mydocs");            /* You cannot change the root directory */
    return 0;
}
```
Note: The code is assuming that running this C program on Unix-based system (e.g., Linux, macOS). If you're using Windows with MSVC, then you will have to use different functions due to differences in how file renaming works between the two platforms. And remember changing files/directories in root directory may cause serious problem if not done correctly, so proceed with caution!
