 In JavaScript, you can use the `+` operator to concatenate strings. You also need to be aware of the difference between string literals and template literals (` backticks ``). Here is your C code converted into JavaScript:

```javascript
var s = "hello";
var s2 = s + " literal";
console.log(s);
// or
console.log(`${s} literal`);
console.log(s2);
```
