The JavaScript code provided is using the ActiveXObject to interact with the Windows File System (FS). 

The equivalent C code can't be written directly because C lacks native functions like `FileExists` in JavaScript. However, we can check if files and directories exist using standard C library function `access()`. It checks whether the file exists and is accessible.

Here's the C code to perform the same operations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    char path1[] = "input.txt";
    char path2[] = "c:/input.txt";
    char dir1[] = "docs";
    char dir2[] = "c:/docs";

    if (access(path1, F_OK)) {
        printf("'%s' does not exist.\n", path1);
    } 

    if (access(path2, F_OK))) {
        printf("'%s' does not exist.\n", path2);
    }

    if (access(dir1, F_OK)) {
        printf("'%s' does not exist.\n", dir1);
    } 

    if (access(dir2, F_OK))) {
        printf("'%s' does not exist.\n", dir2);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This C code is performing the same operations as the JavaScript code. It checks if files 'input.txt', 'c:/input.txt', and directories 'docs' and 'c:/docs' exist in the current working directory and the root directory of the filesystem, respectively.
