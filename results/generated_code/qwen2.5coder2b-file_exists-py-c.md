To convert this Python code to C, you can use the POSIX system's `access` function along with `chdir` to change directory. The following is a simplified version of how you might implement this in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

void check_file(const char* filename) {
    if (access(filename, R_OK)) {
        printf("The file %s does not exist or is not accessible.\n", filename);
    } else {
        printf("The file %s exists and is accessible.\n", filename);
    }
}

void check_directory(const char* directoryname) {
    if (access(directoryname, X_OK)) {
        printf("The directory %s does not exist or is not accessible.\n", directoryname);
    } else {
        printf("The directory %s exists and is accessible.\n", directoryname);
    }
}

int main() {
    check_file("input.txt");
    check_directory("docs");

    // Check the current working directory
    char cwd[1024];
    if (getcwd(cwd, sizeof(cwd)) != NULL) {
        printf("Current working directory: %s\n", cwd);
        check_file("input.txt");
        check_directory("docs");
    } else {
        perror("Error getting current working directory");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This C code does not perform the same checks as the Python script, since it uses `access` to check access and `getcwd` to get the current working directory. It also does not explicitly handle errors like file not found or permission issues that might occur in these functions.

The Python code checks if a file or directory exists, and whether the process running this script has read or write permissions respectively. The C code uses POSIX system calls to achieve similar functionality but is more low-level.
