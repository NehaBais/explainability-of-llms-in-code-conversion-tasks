Here's the Python code that accomplishes the same task:
```python
s1 = "Hello"
s1 += ", World!"
print(s1)
```
The output of this code will be: `Hello, World!` 
Note that in Python, we don't need to use the `+=` operator to concatenate strings. We can simply use the `+` operator and it will automatically convert the string into a list before concatenating. Also, in Python, we don't need to declare the variable type explicitly, so we can use the `print()` function without specifying the data type of the variable.
