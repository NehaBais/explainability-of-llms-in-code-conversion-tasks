The JavaScript code will be different because it doesn't support direct file or directory creation in the same way as Java does. However, with NodeJS and some npm packages, we can achieve similar functionality to create files and directories. Here is how you could do it using `fs` and `path` modules from node:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

try {
    fs.writeFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, 'output.txt'), '', { flag: 'w' });  // creates file "output.txt" in current directory
    fs.writeFileSync('/output.txt', '', { flag: 'w' });   // creates file "/output.txt" in root (requires sudo)
    
    fs.mkdirSync(path.resolve(__dirname, 'docs'),{ recursive: true });  // creates directory "docs" in current directory
    fs.mkdirSync('/docs',{ recursive: true });   // creates directory "/docs" in root (requires sudo)
} catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
}
```
Please note that creating a file at the filesystem root requires superuser rights, which is why the second example uses '/' as the path and 'sudo' to execute it. However, be aware of security implications when performing such actions in a production environment! 
This script should run with NodeJS (version 14.0.0 or higher). It writes an empty file using `writeFileSync` method. If the directory doesn't exist, you have to use { recursive: true } as an option to `mkdirSync` in order for it to create parent directories if they don't exist.
