In Rust, you can use the `std::fs` module to achieve this. Here is how you can rename a file and directory:
```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Renaming files/directories in the current working directory
    fs::rename("input.txt", "output.txt")?;
    fs::rename("docs", "mydocs")?;

    // Renaming files/directories in the filesystem root
    fs::rename(&Path::new("/").join("input.txt"), &Path::new("/").join("output.txt"))?;
    fs::rename(&Path::new("/").join("docs"), &Path::new("/").join("mydocs"))?;

    Ok(())
}
```
This code uses the `fs::rename` function from the standard library, which renames a file or directory. It takes two arguments: the current name of the file/directory and its new name.

The `std::path::Path` module is used to create platform-independent path operations. Here, we're joining `/` with the filenames to indicate that they should be interpreted as absolute paths, i.e., from the filesystem root.

The `?` operator is used for error handling in Rust. If an error occurs during renaming, it will be returned up the call stack and handled accordingly.
