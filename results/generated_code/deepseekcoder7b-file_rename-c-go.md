Golang doesn't have a built-in function like C's `rename()`, it uses the `os.Rename()` method of package os for renaming files and directories. Here is the equivalent Golang code to achieve this requirement:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func renameFileOrDir(oldPath, newPath string) {
	err := os.Rename(oldPath, newPath)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error: ", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("%s has been renamed to %s\n", oldPath, newPath)
	}
}

func main()  {
    // Rename here (current directory)
    renameFileOrDir("input.txt", "output.txt")
    renameFileOrDir("docs", "mydocs")
	
	// Rename in the filesystem root (assuming you're running from a Unix-based system, where root is represented by "/" ) 
    // As Go doesn't have an equivalent of C's absolute path renaming, below code won't work.
    // renameFileOrDir("/input.txt", "/output.txt")
    // renameFileOrDir("/docs", "/mydocs") 
}
```
Please note that in Golang there is no direct way to perform an absolute path renaming, so the commented lines won't work as expected. The paths should always be relative to the current working directory. 
If you are on a Unix-based system and need to rename files or directories at root level ("/"), you would usually do this from another program that has superuser rights, or you could write into "/" directory if it's mounted on your filesystem at `/`. But such use cases have security implications that make Go unsuitable for tasks like this unless explicitly permitted by the system administrator.
