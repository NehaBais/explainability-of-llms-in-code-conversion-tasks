Here's how you can convert the given C code to Rust.

```rust
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b));
    println!("not a is {}", !a));
}
```
In this Rust code, the function `print_logic` takes two boolean values as input parameters.

The println! macro is used to print out the result of "and" and "or" on both arguments as well as "not" on the first argument.
