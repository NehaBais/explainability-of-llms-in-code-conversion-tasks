 The JavaScript file system operations like `fs.writeFile` and `fs.mkdir` do not exist in Java. In Java, you have to use the NIO (New IO) or File API for these operations. Here is a simple equivalent code in Java using java.io.* package:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
        // Create an empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory called "docs".
        
        FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
        outputStream.close();
        
        File file = new File("/output.txt");
        file.createNewFile();
        
        File docsDir = new File("docs");
        docsDir.mkdir();
        
        File rootDir = new File("/docs");
        rootDir.mkdir();
    }
}
``` 

This code does the same thing as your JavaScript code, namely creating a file and directory in both the current working directory and filesystem root. Be aware that you must have enough permissions to create files/directories in different locations (e.g., /).
