The code for the function should be as follows:

void print_logic(bool a, bool b);
{
std::cout << std::boolalpha; // so that bools are written as "true" and "false"
std::cout << “a and b is ” << (a && b) << “
”;
std::cout << “a or b is ” << (a || b) << “
”;
std::cout << “not a is ” << (!a) << “
”;
}


The code for the function should be as follows:

```java
public static void print_logic(boolean a, boolean b){
System.out.println("a and b is " + (a && b));
System.out.println("a or b is " + (a || b));
System.out.println("not a is " + !a);
} 
```
