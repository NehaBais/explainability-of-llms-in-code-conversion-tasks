Here's the equivalent code in JavaScript:
```
function logic(a, b) {
 console.log("a AND b: " + (a && b));
 console.log("a OR b: " + (a || b));
 console.log("NOT a: " + (!a));
}
```
The syntax is slightly different in JavaScript compared to Java. Here's a breakdown of the changes:
- `public static void logic(boolean a, boolean b)` becomes `function logic(a, b)`.
- The `System.out.println` statement becomes `console.log`.
- The logical operators (`&&`, `||`, and `!`) remain the same.
