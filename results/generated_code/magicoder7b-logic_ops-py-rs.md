 In Rust, you can define the function like this:

```rust
fn logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b: {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b: {}", a || b);
    println!("not a: {}", !a);
}
```
The '&&' operator performs an "and" operation in Rust. Similarly, '||' is used for the "or". The '!' symbol before a variable (like `!a`) is used to perform the "not" operation.
