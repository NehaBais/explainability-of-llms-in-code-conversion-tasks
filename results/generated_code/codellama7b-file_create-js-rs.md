You can use the following code to create a new empty file "output.txt" of size 0 bytes in the current working directory and in the filesystem root:
```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let path = PathBuf::from("./output.txt");
    fs::write(&path, &[]).unwrap();
    
    let path = PathBuf::from("/output.txt");
    fs::write(&path, &[]).unwrap();

    let path = PathBuf::from("./docs");
    fs::create_dir(&path).unwrap();

    let path = PathBuf::from("/docs");
    fs::create_dir(&path).unwrap();
}
```
To create an empty directory called "docs" in the current working directory and in the filesystem root, you can use the following code:

use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let path = PathBuf::from("./docs");
    fs::create_dir(&path).unwrap();
    
    let path = PathBuf::from("/docs");
    fs::create_dir(&path).unwrap();
}

Note that these examples use the `std::fs` module to interact with the file system. The `PathBuf` type is used to construct paths to files and directories, and the `write` and `create_dir` functions are used to create new files and directories.
