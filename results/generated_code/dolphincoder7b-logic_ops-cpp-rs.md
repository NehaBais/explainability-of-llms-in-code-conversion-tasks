The Rust equivalent of the given C++ code would be:
```
fn print_logic(a: bool, b: bool) {
    println!("a and b is {}", a && b);
    println!("a or b is {}", a || b);
    println!("not a is {}", !a);
}
```
This Rust function takes two boolean arguments 'a' and 'b', prints the result of "and", "or", and "not" on both arguments, in the desired format.
