In C++, you can use the `std::filesystem` library to perform file and directory operations. Here is an example of how you could rename a file and directory in the current working directory and in the filesystem root:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <filesystem>

int main() {
    std::filesystem::rename("input.txt", "output.txt");
    std::filesystem::rename("docs", "mydocs");
    std::filesystem::rename("/input.txt", "/output.txt");
    std::filesystem::rename("/docs", "/mydocs");
    return 0;
}
```
Note that the `std::filesystem` library is only available in C++17 and later, so you may need to use a compiler flag or header file to enable it. Additionally, make sure that your code has the necessary permissions to perform these operations.
