To convert the code from Go to C++, we can use a similar approach as in the previous example. We'll create a new variable `txt` that will store the value "little", and then use the `sprintf()` function to format the string using the `%s` specifier. The resulting output will be the string "Mary had a little lamb".
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string str = "Mary had a %s lamb";
    std::string txt = "little";
    std::cout << sprintf(str, txt) << std::endl;
}
```
Note that in C++, we use the `std::cout` stream to print the output to the console, rather than using `fmt.Println()`. We also need to include the `<string>` header file to use the `std::string` class and the `sprintf()` function.
