error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s`
 --> /tmp/qwen2.5coder7b-str_concat-java-rs.rs:5:36

2 |     let s = String::from("hello");
  |         - move occurs because `s` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
3 |     println!("{}", s + " literal");
  |                    -------------- `s` moved due to usage in operator

5 |     let s2 = format!("{} literal", s);
  |                                    ^ value borrowed here after move

note: calling this operator moves the left-hand side

  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__export::format_args` which comes from the expansion of the macro `format` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
