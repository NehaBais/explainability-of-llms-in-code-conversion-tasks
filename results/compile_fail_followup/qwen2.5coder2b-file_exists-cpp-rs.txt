error[E0277]: `Path` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`
 --> /tmp/qwen2.5coder2b-file_exists-cpp-rs.rs:4:20

4 |     println!("{}", path);
  |                    ^^^^ `Path` cannot be formatted with the default formatter; call `.display()` on it
  |
  = help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `Path`, which is required by `&Path: std::fmt::Display`
  = note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead
  = note: call `.display()` or `.to_string_lossy()` to safely print paths, as they may contain non-Unicode data
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
