error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s1`
 --> /tmp/qwen2.5coder7b-str_concat-py-rs.rs:5:34

2 |     let s1 = String::from("hello");
  |         -- move occurs because `s1` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
3 |     println!("{}", s1 + " world");
  |                    ------------- `s1` moved due to usage in operator

5 |     let s2 = format!("{} world", s1);
  |                                  ^^ value borrowed here after move

note: calling this operator moves the left-hand side

  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__export::format_args` which comes from the expansion of the macro `format` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
